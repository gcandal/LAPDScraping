It is a perfect example of an issue that, if we invest in it, can bring benefits to the economy, people and our environment.</p><p>It is worth saying at the outset that I think we should separate two things that, whilst they are connected, are different: cycle tourism and leisure cycling and, I suppose, cycling as a mode of transport.  The needs of the two types of cyclist, whilst connected, will in many cases be different, and the provisions that are required may be different.  If we are going to achieve the modal shift in what we use as our daily or commuting transport, it is important to bear that in mind to ensure that the two are not confused and we end up doing neither one nor the other. As the Committee Chair rightly said at the start of the debate, cycling should be a normal form of transport.  It should be an option along with taking the car, using public transport or walking.  It should be one of our choices for how we get to and from work and go about our daily needs.</p><p>I will speak of my own experience of public transport from Bangor.  Despite the numerous civil servants etc who travel from Bangor to the Stormont estate and although it is easy to get to Stormont, if you work past 5.15 pm, you cannot return home by public transport.  When I worked as a researcher for an MLA, I discussed the possibility of biking it here with another worker in the Building.  We decided that the Craigantlet hills were a bit dangerous &#8212; and a bit hilly, I have to say.  They were a bit of a challenge.  We thought that we could cycle to the train station, get the train, get off at the nearest stop and cycle to Stormont, which might be safer and easier.  Then, of course, we faced another hurdle, which was the fact that we might not get on the train with our bikes during the morning rush hour, when cyclists are not always permitted on trains with their bikes.  The barriers are there to making that modal shift and that transition to cycling being one of the choices.</p><p>To change that, we need investment.  I recently asked the Minister to outline the ratio of spend of public to private transport.  I was delighted to see the projection of 35% spend on public transport in next year's budget.  I know that this is about cycling, but the two very much need to link together, as my experience shows.  To date, the numbers have been going in the opposite direction, and the percentage spend on public transport has been decreasing.  So, I welcome the Minister's answer to that question, and I hope he meets his commitment to a 35% spend on public transport.</p><p>To come to the other side, I believe that there has been a failure.  In another question for written answer, I asked the Minister about the recent resurfacing works in Ballymiscaw, and, in the same answer that he told me that there was no consultation with his cycle unit about cycling provision on the road, he told me that his Department would seek to seize opportunities as they arose.  With the continuous road works that we are doing around the country, we should always consider cycling and consider the opportunities.  It is a wide road, and there is definitely the space for it.  Prior to that, I had noted that Massey Avenue was being resurfaced.  It is a very wide road, which confuses people as to whether it is one lane or two.  There is plenty of space for cycling provision, but, again, the focus was not given to it.  Furthermore, an example of where we have, to some extent, failed with existing cycle lanes is on the Newtownards Road in Bangor, which is in my constituency.  There is a perfectly good cycle lane &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Cycling: Benefits to the Economy"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>&#8212; but there is just one problem with it: there are cars parked the full length of it.</p><p>We need to ensure that we put the investment into public transport and into cycling and that we do so in a strategic way to ensure that the provisions that we create are not tokenistic but strategic.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Cycling: Benefits to the Economy"}, {"date": "2015-03-10", "body": "<p>As I rise to speak, I have a picture of Lisa Dorrian in front of me, along with images of her family during the recent appeal.  Lisa was my age, and it is hard not to put yourself back 10 years.  Where was I?  I, like Lisa, was partying.  I was without responsibility &#8212; I did not have children at that time &#8212; and no doubt I was irresponsible at times.  I suppose, in my own context, I was largely safe and had the advantage of being male.  That is unfortunately still an advantage in this society.  Violence against women is still all too prevalent.  It is very much still a scourge and an issue that we have to deal with, whether it is domestic violence within the privacy of a family home or this violent act that we understand has been committed and that we have yet to fully discover the truth of.</p><p>It is 10 years on, and I am fortunate to have children of my own.  That is a future that was denied to Lisa.  I can only imagine, as a parent, how Lisa's family must feel &#8212; her parents, John and Patricia, and, indeed, her sisters, Joanne, Michelle and Ciara.  I can only speculate how that tragedy has impacted on their lives.  I extend my sympathy to them, as my North Down colleagues have done today.</p><p>All I can do is echo the appeals that have been made.  There are people out there who know what happened.  Whether for right or for reward, they should bring forward that information.  If needs be to protect them from any fear of persecution, they can do that confidentially through Crimestoppers.</p><p>As has been stated on a number of occasions in this debate, the family want to find Lisa's body.  They want to give her the burial that she deserves.  I call on those with information to let their consciences rest, let the family have peace and bring forward this information to help this family to move on.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Lisa Dorrian: Tenth Anniversary of Her Disappearance"}, {"date": "2015-03-10", "body": "<p>The Minister and I have engaged on my private Member's Bill, which calls for a statutory duty to cooperate.  I am conscious that, if I paraphrase the Minister and get him wrong, he will call me out on it, so I will try to be accurate in my description.  I think that he is, at best, ambivalent about my Bill and the need for legislation.  Perhaps I have not provided him with sufficient examples of why I believe that my Bill is needed.  If he needs a further example, it is his Bill.</p><p>As other Members said, this is a key issue and it is important that we get it right.  There are too many examples, not so much of what is in the Bill &#8212; I do not think that I have any major objections to that &#8212; but of what is not.</p><p>I am delighted that the Chair of the Committee for Employment and Learning spoke because he highlighted one of the problems.  Where is the post-18 and post-19 SEN provision in the Bill?  Indeed, where in the Bill are the duties on the Department of Health?  The problem with the Bill is not its content but that it is a Department of Education Bill when what we need is a cross-departmental Bill to properly deal with the issues that affect children with special educational needs and their families.  If we are to get it right, we need those three Departments' input.  Whilst I have no doubt that there has been consultation, it is apparent that there has not been cooperation and collaboration, because we are left with a single departmental Bill when SEN provisions stretch across at least three Departments and perhaps more.</p><p>A number of Members highlighted the issue with clause 4 and the duty on the Education Authority to request health and social care bodies' help in cases where possible special educational needs have been identified.  However, there is no reciprocal duty.  We are effectively being told that the Department cannot legislate for that, as one Minister cannot legislate for the other.  I understand that.  We need a cross-departmental Bill, and, if that is not possible, we need to look at our systems of governance.  What appears to be the case and what many Members alluded to is that the Minister cannot do that, so the House will have to.  In my view, that is not good governance.  If it is clear that there is an omission from the Bill, it should have been resolved between Departments in cooperation at Executive level before the legislation was brought to the House.</p><p>I have seen examples of very good multidisciplinary work in the diagnosis of SEN.  Again, it appears that that work happens within the Department of Health and that there is potentially less scope for it within the Department of Education or, at least, within schools.  I am sure that there are counter-examples, but, in my experience, that joined-up working between the Department of Education and the Department of Health still seems to have some way to go.</p><p>In the research for my Bill, I came across a great quote in which one parent defined integrated services as not having to repeat yourself 30 times in 30 different contexts.  If we are to really improve timelines, we need the services to wrap around the child and the family, rather than them having to go to each assessment and each practitioner to get the various assessments while explaining the child's experiences each time, repeating themselves and duplicating effort.</p><p>This goes back to the need for joined-up working between the Departments and some of the issues that Robin Swann raised, but another great omission from the Bill is transitions.  We have had the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People report on transitions for many years.  It highlights the parallel approach for transitions planning of the Health Department and the Education Department.  We all find transitions difficult, but children with autism will find them particularly difficult.  We are sometimes multiplying those transitions because the Health Department will have one plan for the transition from child to adult services, and the Education Department will have another plan.  That increases the challenges for a child, when surely our government structures should be mitigating the challenges that those children face.</p><p>An issue that has recently come to my attention, which ties into this, is the experience of blind and partially sighted children.  I absolutely have to give credit to the Education Department because the evidence is that blind and partially sighted children do well in education.  Their educational performance is on a par with their peers, yet, post secondary education, there is a significant dip in further and higher education and employment.  Again, that is why a SEN Bill that comes solely from the Education Department cannot and will not &#8212; arguably, it is not the policy intention &#8212; solve these problems.  It is regrettable that we have a SEN Bill that does not address those issues.  It is a missed and wasted opportunity if we do not propose to address the issues of transitions and of SEN post-19.</p><p>Clause 5 deals with the time that it takes for diagnosis, and anyone would welcome any reduction in the time frame.  Constituents have come to me with their experiences, as has happened to many Members.  Certainly, one case appeared in the press, on which I asked a number of questions.  It appears that things are improving, but there was a particular problem in the South Eastern Education and Library Board area, where I think that it is fair to say that the timelines were unacceptable.  However, as I said, I welcome the improvements that have been made.</p><p>Maybe it is not a place for legislation, but it is worth putting on record that, when problems are identified, it is important that we do not wait for the assessment process to make interventions.  I have seen good practice in schools, where, on the identification of a problem, support is put in place rather than waiting for the assessment process to complete its course.  When a problem is recognised, the interventions are in place and the five-stage approach, as it stands, gives schools and teachers the powers to act quickly.  The evidence is that those interventions, rather than the statement or a decision not to impose a statement, make the difference for a child.  However, as a lot of the legislation stands, the statement becomes important for access to some services and resources for schools.  I am not negating the importance of statements in the context of our system, but they should not be the be-all and end-all.  When needs are identified, a child should receive the interventions as soon as is practicable.</p><p>A lot of this comes down to investment in the early years.  We have the evidence that shows that this is where we can have the biggest impact with the most efficient use of resources.  That will be particularly true, or certainly no less true, for children with special educational needs.  Again, that is why we need a cross-departmental Bill.  Some of the interventions that are required potentially will be before a child will come into contact with the formal education system, whether at nursery or primary school.  Again, that early identification and support is very necessary to ensure the best outcomes for these children.</p><p>I have to say that my experience is that, currently, provision is mixed across schools and across boards.  I have said on occasions that it is about making good practice common practice.  I have to give credit to my son's school, Bangor Central Integrated Primary School, where I have seen some very good practice.  I am not saying that it is perfect, but some of the interventions that have been shown to work with children with special educational needs are actually being rolled out across the school.  A child with special educational needs is not being taken aside and given special provision &#8212; if that is necessary, that is fine &#8212; but some of that which would have been deemed to be special provision is actually being generalised; for example, the use of visual cues rather than solely verbal cues.  It has actually been found to be of benefit to all children.  That is a model of good practice.  I do not have sufficient experience to say how widespread that practice is, but I certainly think that we need to take those positive examples of good practice and learning between schools and indeed, as I say, across board areas until we move to the single Education Authority, because it is clear that provision is mixed and that children's experiences differ from school to school and board to board.  As I say, the school that I have most experience with has been very positive.  I want to put that on record.  There is good practice, and it can be built upon.</p><p>As I say, I believe that the issue with this Bill is not what is in it but very much what is not in it and indeed the fact that it comes from one Minister.  Ultimately, this is a Bill that had to be agreed at Executive level and should be cross-departmental in its scope and provisions because, if we are going to properly address the problems with special educational need provision in the system &#8212; and there is good practice, but more needs to be done &#8212; the only way in which we can do that is through cooperation across Departments and cross-departmental legislation.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>I welcome the debate and the Committee's focus on wind energy.  As a supporter of wind energy, I want community buy-in for good wind projects based on good consultation.  I also want the implementation of many of the measures that are called for in the report to promote community benefit, engagement and, when possible, ownership.</p><p>Like Alban Maginness, I was at the launch today of a solar energy cooperative, which will be run very much for community benefit.  I welcome the work of the Ulster Community Investment Trust (UCIT) and the Northern Ireland Community Energy (NICE) board on that project.  I also declare an interest as a shareholder in Northern Ireland's first wind energy cooperative, Drumlin Wind Energy.  Indeed, it was the first example in Northern Ireland of community ownership of energy, and I want people to avail themselves increasingly of such a model.</p><p>Despite claims from the Member opposite and from such sources as the 'Daily Mail' and the 'The Daily Telegraph', wind energy is the cheapest form not only of renewable energy but of all forms of energy production.  That was borne out by the EU Commission study, which, having looked at all the costs, including subsidies and external costs such as to health and the environment, found that, to generate 1 MW of energy by onshore wind cost roughly &#8364;105, compared with &#8364;164 for gas and &#8364;233 for coal.  It is easy to state that wind energy is expensive &#8212; it does have upfront costs &#8212; but the unit cost is zero, and the life cycle of wind energy generation is cheaper than for other forms of energy.  Indeed, the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee has heard, on numerous occasions, that, when demand for electricity can be met by renewable energy generation alone, the marginal cost is significantly lower than when gas comes onto the system.  The reality is that the price of wind is coming down, and, whilst gas prices have dipped, the overall trend is upward.  When we consider the costs of 500 deaths a year related to air pollution and the impacts of climate change, it is clear that the cost of other sources of energy such as gas and coal is significantly greater.</p><p>Turning to the report, I think that I am right in saying that the Committee Chair expressed the support of the Committee for the proposal that wider economic, social and environmental impacts should not be taken into account when planning decisions are made on wind farms.  I believe that this contradicts the Committee recommendation to take a strategic approach.  Inevitably, these projects are regionally significant, and their wider impact must be taken into consideration, as for any major energy project.  I do not believe that we would have Kilroot, Ballylumford or, going forward, the North/South interconnector if we looked solely at the local impact of an energy development.  They are regionally significant, so we have to look more widely than the local impact.</p><p>I certainly welcome further research into and monitoring of the noise impacts, but we need to take an evidence-based approach.  The World Health Organization has said about imperceptible noise that there is no reliable evidence that sounds below the hearing threshold produce physiological or psychological effects.  We should continue to monitor it, but we have to make decisions based on the evidence available.</p><p>I find some of the opposition to wind projects hard &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Wind Energy Inquiry Report"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>&#8212; to understand.

I will conclude by thanking the Bill Office for their work on the amendments, both at Consideration Stage and Further Consideration Stage.  As mentioned by Mr Attwood, the way in which we do legislation here means that there is a short period to work on such amendments.  Certainly, there was not a single amendment that I could not bring forward due to lack of time, thanks to the hard work of the Bill Office.</p><p>It will be those outside the Chamber who will judge who, in the overall debate today, has been genuine and upfront about the changes being put through by the Assembly.  The Stormont House Agreement was raised on numerous occasions.  Parties will also be judged by those outside the Chamber on their role during and since the Stormont House negotiations.</p><p>I will speak very briefly on the amendments.  I welcome the Minister's tabling of an amendment to report within three years of Royal Assent.  I intend to move my amendment with the word \"independent\".  We will agree to disagree on that, but I appreciate that he has sought to meet me halfway on the proposal that I tabled at Consideration Stage.  That should be acknowledged.  It is important that such significant legislation be reported on. An independent report would give the public more confidence.  I suspect that outside agencies will produce reports on the Welfare Reform Act anyway, so it will be interesting to see how the Department takes forward the reporting process, subject to the outcome of the votes after the debate.</p><p>The Minister has given a commitment to Mr Attwood and the SDLP should their amendment not be passed.  The Minister is well aware of my concerns and those of many others about the sanctions regime and how it will be implemented.  It is important that we remain vigilant.  The sanctions regime has the potential to drive people into severe destitution and reliance on food banks.  Whilst I disagree with the system, it should be applied correctly and fairly; it should not be used as a way of cutting the welfare bill.  I welcome the Minister's commitment on those issues and to ensuring the accuracy and standards of the sanctions regime.</p><p>That concludes my remarks on the group 2 amendments.

[Mr Attwood.]</span></p><p>Amendment Nos 5, 6 and 7 should be taken together, and I urge Members, if they are to support them, to do so as a whole as they rely on each other to achieve the objective. Amendment No 7 lists the regulations as they relate to universal credit: standard allowance; children and young persons element; housing cost element; claimants subject to no work-related requirements; sanctions; and hardship payments. The intention of the amendments is to ensure that, for each of those key aspects of universal credit, draft legislation is laid before the Assembly and debated before being implemented.</p><p>Collectively, the amendments would remove the current confirmatory arrangement and replace it with a draft affirmative one.  As the Minister said at the previous stage, that is not the usual convention for social security payments, but, given the significant changes, it is important that the regulations come before the House before being implemented. Not only would it give the Assembly an opportunity to debate them before their introduction but it would be difficult, should they be introduced prior to confirmation by the Assembly, to remove them.  My question to the Minister is this: if the Assembly did not agree to the regulations under the confirmatory procedure, how would that leave the application of universal credit?  It is my view that they should be agreed in advance and not be subject to confirmative resolution after regulations have been made and, indeed, implemented.</p><p>I will move on to amendment Nos 19 and 24.  As the Minister mentioned in the debate on the previous group, we had discussions on the duty to report.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has tabled an amendment.  The single difference between the two amendments is the word \"independent\", and we had a similar debate on the previous group.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to reviewing the Welfare Reform Act three years after it receives Royal Assent, but it is my view that the review should be independent. At the previous stage, I tabled an amendment that gave more detail on what I would like to be in such a report.  In seeking to meet the Minister halfway, I have removed the \"vulnerable groups\" stipulation, and I leave the terms of reference to the Department, but I feel that it is important to keep the word \"independent\".  The Department and the Executive have a clear policy intent in introducing the Welfare Reform Bill. It should be an outside body that reports on its impact, its effectiveness and its implementation.</p><p>Amendment No 25, tabled by the SDLP, proposes that the joint standards committee monitor the standards and quality of decision-making on sanctions.  I think that the amendment is sound.  I will wait to hear the rationale from the proposer and the Minister's response, but, at this time, I am minded to support it.</p><p>I think that I am right in saying that the only other amendment is amendment No 12, which seems to be a simple rewording.</p><p>I do not see any policy change there, although, again, we will wait to hear the Minister's rationale.</p><p class=\"italic\">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p><p>To summarise briefly, my amendments are important, as they would bring further Assembly scrutiny of regulations and of the Bill, should it pass Final Stage, in the form of an independent report.  This is a major piece of legislation, and it has taken a long time to get here.  Many have concerns about it, and it is right that the greatest scrutiny possible be given to the implementation of the Bill itself, to the regulations that come from it, to how effective it is and to what its effect is.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Welfare Reform Bill: Further Consideration Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-24", "body": "<p>I will give way in one second.</p><p>My argument is that I could not tell anyone that they will not be worse off under the Bill.

At the previous stage, when I proposed an amendment that people be given a year to find work rather than being uprooted from their home, Mr Attwood made a point about the difference between a house and a home.  I do not know whether that individual would have to move out of the community to accept suitable accommodation.  The issue could be that they have lost their job.  Another possible change of circumstance is a relationship break-up.  If someone's partner and children leave, and they are left alone in a large house, should they be kicked further by having to move out?</p><p>I thought that a reasonable amendment at Consideration Stage would have been to give people the opportunity to get back on their feet and to find work or accommodation that they deem suitable.  I disagree fundamentally with the principle of the bedroom tax.  Others just disagree with the practical application, given the lack of one- and two-bedroom houses, but I disagree with uprooting people because they have become unemployed or their relationship has broken down, and I disagree that we should just look at the size of the unit that they occupy.  It is a home, and ultimately the solution is better investment in public housing, not simply moving those in public housing around to fit a perceived public good.</p><p>Another interesting point raised, I think by Mr Beggs, concerned how much of the &#163;565 million would be spent on administration.  Undoubtedly, the supplementary scheme, however it is implemented and whoever receives the benefit of it, will have to be administered.</p><p>I was coming to the figures anyway, but this is a good point at which to address them.  Those who have said that no one will be worse off under welfare reform have either ignored the figures or the figures have changed in ways that I cannot understand.  I have not heard anything to help me understand them.  Before the Stormont House Agreement, the lower estimate of the impact of the welfare cuts, which came from the Minister for Social Development, was &#163;115 million.  The higher estimate was &#163;250 million, and that figure came from NICVA.  At one point, the First Minister said that, if we did not implement welfare reform, the impact would be up to &#163;1 billion a year.  I never knew where that figure came from.  That, however, was the range of figures.   Now we are told to accept that &#163;94 million a year is enough to ensure that no one is worse off, and, as Mr Beggs correctly highlighted, that is before we take into account the administration of the supplementary payment scheme.  How much will that take out of the &#163;94 million a year on average?  How can we make the commitment that no one will be worse off and everyone will receive transition payments to bring them back to the level that they would have been at had we not implemented welfare reform?</p><p>That bring me &#8212; I have gone in reverse order &#8212; to Mickey Brady's contribution.

I do not think that you could read the Donaldson report and conclude otherwise than that the Causeway would be one of the hospitals within his target range for the closure or reduction of acute services.  The Minister needs to be very emphatic and very clear with the House tonight about what he means.  What will he emphatically stand by in regard to the retention of the Causeway as an acute hospital, or does the equivocation that might arise rest in the use of the word \"small\"?  Is he in fact trying to marry the audacious attempts of Donaldson and his commitment to the Causeway Hospital with some sort of agenda to diminish facilities?  Will the Minister be absolutely clear?

The Department has responsibility for project D: under any new model, what support can the Minister give to employers and small businesses to encourage them to hire and upskill the groups mentioned in the statement?  What can his Department do in the future that it is not doing now?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>I rise to take part in this important debate on the future of neighbourhood policing across Upper Bann.  I thank Mrs Dobson for bringing forward the Adjournment topic.</p><p>We are in difficult and uncertain times for policing.  However, we, as politicians, must never be found wanting when it comes to highlighting provision for our district.  I have always taken an active interest in community policing.  I believe it to be fundamental to ensuring community confidence and safety for my constituents.  I was a member of the Craigavon District Policing Partnership and the Craigavon Community Safety Partnership, which have now been taken over by the relatively new PCSP.  I believed in those organisations, which I saw as powerful tools to deliver community policing.  I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to all who have been involved in them down through the years.</p><p>Crucially, neighbourhood policing connects the police with the people.  Local knowledge and locally known faces instil community confidence.  By building up a strong level of local knowledge, local police have more credibility and a better standing in the community.  If we can encourage communal confidence in day-to-day policing, that can only be to society's benefit.  Sadly, this is all about to change with the restructuring of neighbourhood policing across our district.  I have grave concerns about that, and, for that reason, I regard this debate as being of considerable importance.</p><p>As we stand, I feel that we are at risk of decimating neighbourhood policing in Upper Bann and undoing all the good work.  It is as serious as that.  There is a sense of worry and unease in our communities, both urban and rural.  That must be addressed if we are to maintain community confidence in our policing structures.  Patten envisaged a new dawn for policing, with peacetime officers in the region of 7,500, but this is no longer the case.  One has to ask whether these proposed changes to neighbourhood policing fly in the face of Patten.</p><p>Only last week, I, along with my party colleagues Stephen Moutray MLA and David Simpson MP, met local police and the Assistant Chief Constable to raise our concerns.  We all understand that we are in difficult economic times, but proposed massive cuts to the most visible element of the PSNI operation, that of community policing, is, in my eyes, foolhardy and short-sighted at best.  Just yesterday, we were utterly astounded to learn that the PSNI has declared a &#163;14 million underspend.  On one hand, we are repeatedly told that front-line police services must be cut and senior police are rarely out of the media as they warn of stringent and visible cuts.  Now, they are handing back &#163;14 million.  That raises serious questions about budget mismanagement.  As my colleague David Simpson said yesterday, it seems absurd and a complete contradiction.  Just a small amount of that &#163;14 million would go a long way towards addressing the problems that we are highlighting in this debate.  The police, in this case, I believe, have a lot of explaining to do.</p><p>My constituency will now be served by four neighbourhood policing teams in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon (ABC) area.  Banbridge will, in turn, be served by the Armagh team.  That will effectively leave a major rural town, which has one of the biggest drug problems in Northern Ireland and a strong nightlife culture, with no neighbourhood policing team at all.  That is a real shame because so much good work has been done in recent years through neighbourhood policing in the Banbridge area in tackling drug-related crime, domestic abuse, attacks on the elderly and general rural crime.  As a result, a positive relationship has been built up between the police and the people who are now at risk.  We all know about the ongoing security problems that the Lurgan and Craigavon area continues to face as well.  In Portadown, illegal activity is, sadly, a prominent problem.</p><p>On top of that, Portadown town does not even have a proper, modern, up-to-date police station.  That says it all.</p><p>I sense a real unease in the community at large in Upper Bann.  Crime levels remain too high.  I could take you to a local shop in my constituency, which was raided last month for the fifth time, and, as I understand it, no one to date has been brought to book for that.  While it is getting no better, we propose to cut the PSNI budget in such a way that we have fewer officers and less resource.  The police and the Justice Minister are well aware of the difficulties and issues that they face in my constituency and in the wider ABC area.</p><p>A dangerous combination of dissident activity, drug crime and organised gang crime, which continue to blight our community, are all big issues.  I urge the police to sit down again and to rethink this reorganisation.  Proper policing is important to us all.  It is, in many ways, a basic human right.  We owe it to our community to get it right.  It is time for us to stand up and try to protect our constituents in the ABC area in relation to the changes.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Policing: Upper Bann"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>As a member of the Employment and Learning Committee, I offer my support to the motion.  It highlights the need for meaningful action in an area where there has been gender imbalance for some time.  The Northern Ireland education system has always given both boys and girls every opportunity to excel academically, from primary level through to secondary level and, in many cases, on to university.  Traditionally, some subjects and some career paths have been regarded as being more suitable for males than females, and vice versa.</p><p>Thankfully, that is changing, but not on a radical enough scale.  That is evident from new entrants and enrolments in higher education courses in 2012-13, as contained in the labour market bulletin entitled 'Women in Northern Ireland' and released last September by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).  In 2012-13, more females than males chose courses in the following areas:  medicine and dentistry; subjects allied to medicine, including nursing and pharmacy; biological sciences; law; social studies; languages; creative arts; and education.  Males, on the other hand, tended to be in the majority in most STEM and STEM-related subjects:  physical sciences; computer science; engineering and technology; and architecture, building and planning.</p><p>What can we do to redress the imbalance?  I feel that the whole area of school careers advice needs to be more focused on encouraging all our young people, but especially girls, to pursue STEM subjects.  The system continues to produce too many graduates in areas where it is very hard to get permanent, well-paid jobs.  As a result, we are losing too many of our most capable young people as part of our brain drain.  Northern Ireland's economy, like the rest of the industrialised world, is facing radical and ever-accelerating change.  The older manufacturing industries are declining or gone, and in their place there are new areas of growth.  I am sure the Minister will not be too annoyed if I quote his words at a recent event, organised by SEMTA and held in Parliament Buildings, to highlight the issues raised by today's motion:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The workforce of the future will be strongly reliant on STEM skills to meet the demands of a growing economy and it is increasingly important that more young people are encouraged to study STEM subjects. I would specifically urge young females to consider studying STEM subjects in school and pursue careers in STEM.\"</p><p>A key area of opportunity is the IT sector and digital technology.  Just recently, 200 teenagers, male and female, from 80 schools and colleges, came together at St George's Market for an annual event organised by the NISP Connect team at the Northern Ireland Science Park.  The American producer Will.i.am, of TV show 'The Voice' fame, was the guest speaker at that event, and he encouraged young people to get excited about a career in the entrepreneurial knowledge economy.</p><p>The event also gave the young people the chance to talk to some of Northern Ireland's most influential start-up entrepreneurs and tech founders.  That sort of event is extremely valuable, as it helps to get the message out, but we have to go further if we want to increase the number of women who study STEM subjects and who are able to compete for well-paid jobs in the local labour market.</p><p>The motion refers to the Minister's statement of 4 June 2013, but that will soon be two years ago.  I know that we face stringent budget cuts, but, if anything, such cuts require an even greater focus and concentration on STEM subjects.  Within that framework, gender imbalance must be robustly tackled.  That will require full Executive involvement, as the motion indicates, and I see a key role for the Department of Education, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Department for Employment and Learning.</p><p>The colleges and universities must constantly assess their recruitment strategies and continue to tailor their courses to meet modern industry's needs.  The business sector also has a key role to play, and I welcome that some bigger companies, such as Allstate NI, have committed to doing all they can to promote gender balance in STEM and IT.  The SMEs can also play their part.</p><p>I support the motion.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for her statement today.

Those groups deserve the highest praise.  Rural Support, which provides a listening and signposting service for farming and rural families in Northern Ireland, is to be highly commended.  It has been able to deliver practical results on the ground.</p><p>One area that I regard as vital is the transport infrastructure.  In the countryside, people need a car just to go about the basics of life.  They do not have the easy access to facilities that those who live in towns and cities take for granted.  In a recent speech on higher education, I said that no one would argue that we should have a university in every town; the same could be said for hospitals and leisure centres and so on.  However, we need to ensure that rural dwellers are not disadvantaged in those things because of where they live.  Services to connect with rural dwellers need to be put in place.  I commend the voluntary organisations that run transport for rural dwellers, and I would like to see more coordination of planning and resources in that area.</p><p>One project that has been well mentioned today and deserves the highest praise is the maximising access to services, grants and benefits in rural areas programme, known as MARA for short.  Many who gave evidence to the Committee praised MARA.  It is collating a most valuable database that can only help to take TRPSI to the next stage.

Indeed, our agricultural base, which is an integral part of our industrial and manufacturing heritage, is central to our economy.  The well-being of the rural community is therefore a big priority.</p><p>In recent decades, our agriculture industry has suffered many setbacks, and that has had a big impact on the quality of life for our rural dwellers.  As farmers' incomes have declined, they have been forced to diversify and have more than one job.  They have also had to grapple with ever-increasing bureaucracy and red tape.  All of that has had a major impact on morale and on the standard of living of farmers and families.  Farmers are people with considerable self-respect, and they are often extremely reluctant to seek help.  However, financial difficulties do not extend only to farming families.  Many non-farming families are also affected, and, in the main, they are private people as well.  For that reason, if for no other, I am pleased that a series of measures is being taken to address the financial hardships and pressures on those who live in the countryside.</p><p>We have many folk who live in the countryside who feel vulnerable, and I think particularly of the lonely and elderly who are often targeted for brutal attack where they live in isolated areas.  Tackling poverty and social exclusion is a key target for the Executive.  The tackling rural poverty and social isolation framework aims to help to tackle poverty and social isolation in rural areas through a series of measures in partnership with statutory and voluntary community groups and Departments. This is a DARD commitment, but it covers a wide range of areas of life, and other Departments and agencies are required to play their part.  Too often, others view rural poverty and deprivation as matters merely for DARD.  The Ulster Farmers' Union, among others, made that point very strongly.</p><p>As the motion confirms, the Committee has been looking at this area, and it has been reviewing the Department's progress on its commitments under its rural anti-poverty and social exclusion programme.  Our position paper sets out the details and makes recommendations.</p><p>It is obvious that the Minister and her officials are taking TRPSI seriously, and, as we gathered evidence, we were also very impressed by the extent of the efforts of a range of voluntary and community groups to make a real difference to rural dwellers' quality of life.

I have considerable sympathy with the overall thrust of the motion and much of what it has to say, but I feel that our amendment leads to a more pragmatic, balanced and realistic assessment of the current situation.</p><p>The timing of the debate is significant.  It is no coincidence that, 50 years ago this month, a decision was taken to implement the Lockwood Commission report, which included a new university to be sited in Coleraine.  We all know the fallout from that, and, 50 years on, in a very much changed Northern Ireland, it is perhaps not helpful to the current debate to dwell too much on what happened in 1965.  I want to point out in passing that the report considered the proposed new city in County Armagh as a possible location, so those of us from Upper Bann could also give vent to a sense of grievance as well as those in the north-west, but, as I said, I am not going to dwell on what might have been.</p><p>What we must do today is look at the higher education needs of Northern Ireland in 2015.  Lockwood said that the proposed second university should be, or would be:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"one for the whole of Northern Ireland\".</p><p>That point still has relevance.  Indeed, to me, and to our amendment, it is central.  We support the expansion of Magee and the development of higher education in Londonderry, as proposed in the One Plan and outlined in the motion and the amendment.  I know that my party colleagues from the maiden city are very keen to see such a development and I can fully understand where they are coming from.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Magee Campus: Ulster University"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>No, I have too much.  However, any strategy must take the financial climate into account.  It must also be Northern Ireland-wide.  We want to see development and expansion of Magee to meet the needs of the local area, but, with respect, the whole of Northern Ireland could be classed as a local area.  This is not some vast landmass like somewhere in the United States.  Coleraine is 30 miles from Londonderry.  Belfast is a bit further, 70 miles, but, today, that is no distance at all.</p><p>I do not want to be flippant, but, if we base our arguments purely on local needs, might we not be in danger of wanting a university in every town?</p><p>Investment in higher education is crucial to the development of Northern Ireland plc.  I made that point very strongly during the debate on further and higher education on 2 February.  Investment in higher education is a key component of the Programme for Government, and that vision is also set out in detail in the 'Graduating to Success' strategy document.  If we are to attract inward investment that can provide us with the sort of high value-added job opportunities that we so greatly desire, our further and higher education sector has a crucial role to play.  In developing such a strategy, the Minister has to encourage the colleges and universities to develop their courses in a very focused and strategic manner, taking limited resources into account.  He also has to tailor his overall strategy on the basis of those limited resources.  In my recent speech, I urged him to use his money wisely.  I think that he would remember that one.  That same advice is the basis for my reasoning this afternoon.</p><p>I support the concepts underlying the One Plan, which is the ambitious regeneration plan for Londonderry.  However, even when it was launched, doubts were expressed about the extent to which the vision could be realised.  Visions and plans are good and necessary, but so much then depends on the prevailing financial climate, which can mean that visions cannot always become a reality in the way that we might like.  That is why our amendment rewords the nature of our commitment to the One Plan's higher education targets.  We are broadly supportive of those targets, but, rather than affirm our commitment, we think it prudent simply to note it.  That said, we also want the Minister to continue to explore the options open to him and to push ahead with his plans for Magee as far as possible.</p><p>The Minister is looking at the Magee campus business plan, but he is on public record as saying that he does not have the funds to contemplate any further expansion of the higher education sector.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Magee Campus: Ulster University"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>He has been given extra money in the Budget, and our amendment urges him to look carefully at those options.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Magee Campus: Ulster University"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>T3.

In 2007, when devolution was established, I was delighted that the economy had been placed at the heart of the Programme for Government.  That remains the position in the current 2011-15 Programme for Government.</p><p>The economy is the key to progress as we continue to seek to move Northern Ireland forward.  In recent years, despite serious world economic downturns that have inevitably affected us all, we have made significant progress in our economic growth.  One of the essential ingredients in any plan to deliver sustained and deep economic growth is education, particularly third-level education.  We must not underestimate the crucial role of the local further and higher education sector in producing the well-educated and highly skilled workforce that we need.</p><p>We are often accused of being stuck in the past, but sometimes it is useful to glance back.  During the dark years of the Troubles, when our society suffered so greatly from terrorism, our economic infrastructure was seriously damaged, and we lost many of our brightest and most capable young people.  Once they left school, they left Northern Ireland to study in universities and colleges in the rest of the United Kingdom or in the Irish Republic.  Many of them got jobs outside Northern Ireland, settled down and never came back.  For too long, we endured what became known as the \"brain drain\".  In more recent years, that haemorrhaging has been reduced &#8212; perhaps even reversed &#8212; but we have to be very careful to ensure that it does not return with a vengeance.</p><p>Priority 1 of the Programme for Government addresses economic growth and the need to achieve long-term economic growth by improving competitiveness and building a larger and more export-driven private sector.  The Programme for Government states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we must rebuild the labour market in the wake of the global economic downturn and rebalance the economy\".</p><p>If we are to meet that central target and rebalance the economy by reducing the public sector and developing our business base, it is imperative that we have a properly educated and skilled local workforce.  Indeed, priority 1 refers specifically to the need for a better, more highly skilled, competent and confident workforce.  One of the first questions foreign companies ask when assessing their investment options is:  \"What sort of existing workforce is there in that location?\" or \"Is there a pool of skills that we need?\"</p><p>During the Budget planning and consultation process towards the end of last year, I became very alarmed by some of the dire warnings about cuts in third-level education coming from the Minister for Employment and Learning.  I raised it with him during questions for oral answer on 20 November when he said that he, too, was concerned but that it was due to the cuts in his departmental budget.  I am glad that my colleague the Finance Minister was able to announce that the Department for Employment and Learning will now receive an extra &#163;33 million to develop the skills that are vital to our workforce.</p><p>The winds of change have had a big impact on our further and higher education sector.  However, I have been impressed by the way in which the sector has adapted to changing needs and financial pressures.  I am in favour of diversity in the curriculum, which will offer a broad range of subjects at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.  However, in times of financial pressure and to meet the demands of business, we must focus our efforts on key subjects such as the STEM subjects, law and modern languages.</p><p>Having met representatives of the further and higher education sector and considered briefing papers submitted to the Committee, I am impressed with the strategic vision of our colleges and universities.  I want to see that develop and grow.  I want to see more of our local young people studying in Northern Ireland, getting good secure jobs in Northern Ireland, and staying in Northern Ireland.  I urge the Minister to make full use of the extra money now available to him by investing wisely and well in further education and higher education.

I have to say that I am totally flabbergasted by the amendment from the Ulster Unionist Party.  If that is the level of financial expertise in that party, I am glad that it is not in the driving seat with our country's finances.  The Ulster Unionist Party amendment serves only one useful purpose, which is to expose their real agenda on the Budget, for it is fairly obvious that they simply want to move some money around so that they can put a small fig leaf over the total mismanagement of the Department that they are supposed to be running.  The Ulster Unionist Party is so desperate to get its hands on some extra money that it is prepared to rob the social investment fund, which does sterling work right across our community.</p><p>I am greatly concerned that, if the amendment is passed, vital funds will be lost to key schemes in my Upper Bann constituency.

In all those negotiations and since, we have said to all the relevant agencies, including the NCA, that they now have to demonstrate, decisively and unambiguously, that no individual or organisation is off-limits, protected or receives a light touch when it comes to organised crime on the island of Ireland.  Having achieved Patten thresholds of accountability when it came to the NCA, we challenged it and the other authorities, because you begin to wonder what is actually going on.</p><p>The date of 5 November 2014 tells the tale.  That was when the biggest diesel laundering operation ever found in these islands was discovered in south Armagh.  It had been in existence for a year.  HMRC removed 50 tons of waste.  It was capable of producing 20 million litres of illicit fuel a year.  The public purse had to clean it up.  One person was arrested from that fuel laundering operation in south Armagh that had been going on for a year.  On the same day, in County Monaghan, another plant, with the capacity to launder dyes out of about 20 million litres of oil every year, was closed down.  In the spring of 2013, on the edge of the River Faughan, a mile or two from the River Foyle outside Derry, the single biggest illegal waste dump ever found in these islands was discovered, in respect of which three people are before the courts.  It is estimated in court papers that &#163;40 million or more of money and illegal assets were secured by those who have been alleged responsible for that offence.</p><p>The issue that arises from all that is this:  when it came to the biggest illegal waste dump ever, which was found two miles outside Derry, the police did not know anything about it; the Serious Organised Crime Agency did not anything about it; and the Organised Crime Task Force, which is chaired by the Minister, did not know anything about it.  Nobody, it seems, knew anything at all about the single biggest illegal waste dump ever found in the history of these islands.  We, on these Benches, do not believe that nobody in any of the relevant agencies &#8212; intelligence, policing, security, crime and the DOE &#8212; could not have known something about what was happening on the edge of the city of Derry.</p><p>I hope that all Members will support the amendment.  It will demonstrate that they are unambiguously opposed to what happened outside Derry and what is happening in south Armagh.  Some people, since the decision on the NCA, are still fence-sitting, to put it at its mildest, when it comes to the issue of organised crime and the tackling of it on the island of Ireland.  We have proposed our amendment to say to all the relevant authorities that, now that we have Patten thresholds of accountability when it comes to the NCA in its operations in Northern Ireland, the NCA has to demonstrate, be it about a waste dump up in Derry or a fuel plant in south Armagh, on the far side of the border or the many others that exist and have existed across Northern Ireland, that it will unambiguously face down any individual or organisation and ensure that nobody is off limits or enjoys a light touch.</p><p>In making that argument, we also have to box clever and think laterally when it comes to the issue of organised crime on the island of Ireland.  Individuals, parties and organisations must face it down.  Information must be shared in an increasing way with the population, so that they are aware of what has happened and, critically, give information and intelligence to the authorities in order to face down those responsible.  We need to learn from the assets regime in the South, where they have integrated the work of assets in a way that sees their assets agency having seconded into it members of the guards, the revenue commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  It is a completely independent statutory organisation.  A joined-up approach in the NCA and the other organisations is essential.  I ask the Minister to confirm whether, even now, there is a dedicated waste subgroup of the Organised Crime Task Force in order to recognise the profile and threat of environmental crime on the island of Ireland.  The last time that he spoke about this in the Assembly, that had not been established.  We have to ensure that individuals who are pursued by the crime agencies, North and South, are not allowed to enter into private deals with the state, that are approved by the courts, in respect of some of their assets.</p><p>There has to be a public profile around all of this.  The evidence is that 95% of the cases that go through the assets agency in the North are dealt with in a secret, private arrangement with no public awareness or publicity. All of that has to be consistent with civil liberty and due process protections.  We need to recognise that, in addition to fuel laundering, illegal alcohol and the illegal importation of cigarettes need dedicated action.</p><p>At the same time, we appeal to the courts and to the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, who has a particular interest in and commitment to dealing with waste crime, to introduce sentencing guidelines that see those who are culpable and responsible for crime, organised crime and waste crime on the island of Ireland face the stiffest penalties rather than our ending up with what happened when I was Minister of the Environment.  A case was brought before the courts, and a proceeds of crime order was made of nearly &#163;120,000, which was significant at the time.  Those responsible handed that money over through their lawyers that afternoon, basically sending the message to the DOE and to government that this was a minor business cost for which a cheque could be written over a lunch break and handed to the state.  We need to ensure that sentencing guidelines are laid down that say to those who are responsible that they will face the full weight and rigour of the law, with maximum not minimum penalties being imposed.</p><p>I will conclude by making this appeal again. What happened in Derry was an indictment of all the relevant agencies.  There is no way that that environmental crime should not have been known to the authorities of the state.  Be it within government or outside government, be it the police or criminal assets agencies, it should have been known about.  In our view, there must have been intelligence that made it known to somebody somewhere, yet it was allowed to happen.  Questions linger about how it was allowed to happen.  The NCA and the other agencies must now demonstrate that nobody involved in that sort of activity &#8212; no one person, no organisation &#8212; whatever their background, their past or the character of their organisation is off limits.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>5.

I have on my left one of the youngest MLAs, if not the youngest, for whom the retirement age will no doubt be 75, 76 or 77.  Maybe we should all declare a bit of an interest in this matter.</p><p>I am advised by Dolores Kelly that the amendments are technical, as was indicated by the Chair of the Committee.  Consequently, we will support them, but there are some broader comments that I want to make, if I am allowed, in respect of where we are in relation to all of this, noting that we reserve the right, as a party, to table amendments at Further Consideration Stage, subject to conversations with the party and Mrs Kelly.</p><p>There are points that I ask the Minister to take on board, although, in part, they are really the responsibility of DFP.  It was not long ago that the Assembly passed legislation in respect of pensions globally, which included a lot of the Hutton proposals.  As Members will be aware, at the Consideration Stage and Further Consideration Stage of that legislation, with a lot of drafting help from the Bill Office, amendments were tabled and approved by the Assembly, and then further amendments were tabled after backroom negotiations between DFP and ourselves and other parties.  Those amendments were aimed at mitigating the effects of pension change for appropriate categories of worker.</p><p>At the cuts action day on 13 March, members of the Fire Brigades Union spoke to me and my colleagues about the provisions in that pensions legislation as they affects firefighters.  Provision was made in that legislation, Minister, to do some further review and assessment &#8212; the full details of which escape my mind at the moment &#8212; of other categories of workers that might be protected when it came to general pension provisions, given the nature of their work.  I think that firefighters and police officers were protected under that legislation but that nurses, porters and teachers, who work in very strenuous physical and other environments, were not.</p><p>Should the debate go on beyond Question Time, my question is this:  where are we with the review provisions that were in that legislation, if my mind is correct on that point?  For reading across to this legislation, that is relevant, because it raises the age levels at which people will be entitled to their pension and covers various circumstances around their entitlement to a pension.  That will then make even more acute the fact that there are certain categories of workers who, because of the nature of their work, are under particular physical, mental or emotional strain and, as such, might deserve some protection.  However, in the Bill before us, the time at which they will get their state pension is to be adjusted.  As a consequence, a spike will legitimately arise for people and their pensions where they are seeking early retirement because of ill health.  How does that work itself through to any and all of this?</p><p>My next comment will not necessarily surprise the Minister.  We argued at Consideration Stage and Further Consideration Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill for a dedicated Committee of the House to interrogate welfare matters.  Given the scale of pension changes that are already in law and those that are going to be in law following the passage of the Bill, we again make the argument &#8212; we are going to write to the relevant authorities in the Assembly in this regard &#8212; to have a Committee of the House to look at welfare and pensions.</p><p>A trip was organised, I think, last Friday by the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA) to Glasgow, where it and various other organisations involved in welfare advice and provision met members of the welfare rights community in Scotland and people in and around the dedicated Welfare Reform Committee of the Scottish Parliament, which is a model that we urged the House to adopt at Consideration Stage and Further Consideration Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill.  It met people involved in the delivery of welfare and the oversight of welfare change in Scotland.  I think that all the parties were invited to attend.  We certainly sent one of our senior policy people on that trip to get better informed about the roll-out of welfare provision in Scotland.  I think that a lot of people came back from that trip saying that there was merit in having oversight of welfare change in the Assembly.  I broaden the argument, Minister:  given the scale of pension change through not just your Ministry but DFP, there is a need for dedicated oversight of welfare and pension change and provision arising from this Bill and the other legislation.</p><p>The third general point that I make is that pensions and changes to pensions are very much on the radar of the Conservative Government.  Although last week's Budget was substantially the reheating of the Chancellor's autumn statement, there were still further pension changes in the Budget narrative.  Just as we have seen significant changes through Hutton and the adjustment of the entitlement age for a pension, I anticipate that, if the Tory Government are re-elected, we have not seen the half of it, not just with austerity, whereby the Chancellor is making it very clear that the scale of austerity as he sees it will be greater over the lifetime of the next Government than it was with the previous Government.</p><p>On the scale of welfare reductions, he has put into the Budget statement &#8212; it was not just comments or briefings to the media or statements issued through his office but was in the Budget statement &#8212; &#163;12 billion more of welfare cuts.  He has already declared his ambition to reduce the tax burden on individuals without explaining how that will be funded.  It is my view and that of the SDLP that, just as welfare and austerity are in play, pensions will be in play with the next Tory Government &#8212; if there is a next Tory Government.  All that confirms that we should have more oversight &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Pensions Bill: Consideration Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>I will in a second.</p><p>We should have more oversight of what is passing through the House today and what is yet to pass in terms of the ambitions of the Chancellor as he competes to become the next Prime Minister.  They will all be outdoing each other.  They will all be saying, \"I can go further on austerity, pension change and welfare reform than you can.  I'm the true Tory.  I'm the successor to Margaret Thatcher\".  I certainly get the sense that the Chancellor very much views himself in the image of Margaret Thatcher, so those are not idle words.  These things could come to pass in the next 50 days, because, as we have said in this House before, on the far side of the Westminster election, if the Tories are re-elected, they will do what they did in 2010.  They will have a replay of an election in May and an urgent emergency Budget in June, which will be about accelerating austerity in the early years.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Pensions Bill: Consideration Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>I will give way to the Member.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Pensions Bill: Consideration Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>As you might have anticipated, I will conclude by replying to that question.

The illegal activity has denied finance to the Treasury, and, as others said, that has resulted in less money being available for our hospitals and schools.

Literally millions of pounds are being made by republican gangsters, who continue to provide funds to allow IRA elements to terrorise parts of our community.</p><p>As others said, this is also frequently associated with illegal tobacco activity and the smuggling of other goods.  Once someone is involved in criminality, they are happy to make money from doing anything.  Therefore, those criminal gangs will be funded through a range of activities.  Once they get the funds, much of which has been raised by fuel laundering, that allows them to branch out into many other aspects of criminality and undermine our economy.</p><p>It is quite frightening that, over the past two years, 2,500 tons of associated waste &#8212; toxic waste &#8212; have been dumped in the Northern Ireland countryside. The huge sums raised, the amount of toxic waste and the damage done to the environment are unbelievable.

Ordinary law-abiding folk are asking what the authorities on both sides of the border are waiting for before they will take concerted action to close down this lucrative illegal industry for good and put those responsible behind bars.

What all of us in the House want to do is to make sure that money is retained in families as far as possible.  Nobody should underestimate the pressures that are on many family budgets at this time.  It was right to table the motion on water rates and to let people know the position, because there has been some confusion.  People say, \"You are being political\", but it is a political matter and a political decision.  How we pay is a political choice.  When an element of confusion has been created, it is only right that we reaffirm the actual position.  I am confident that the Assembly will today reaffirm its rejection of the imposition of water charges on the people of Northern Ireland.</p><p>We should also be aware of the fear in many households out there that, were they to be charged for water separately, that could be an additional cost of at least &#163;400 a year, which is not a small amount by any stretch of the imagination.  Today, the Assembly, acting collectively, can reaffirm its position.  It is an Executive responsibility:  there is no problem with that.  For my part, the motion was never designed to say anything other than that the Assembly reaffirms its rejection of water charges and wants the Executive to work with the Minister to ensure that resources are available and that we have a proper infrastructure.</p><p>We have seen major problems with sewerage and flooding, and we have a very challenging role to play.  What I can say to Members is that, when we as an Executive look collectively at this, we know that we cannot spend the same pound twice.  We will have to prioritise.  When you decide to prioritise, by very definition, you will put more pressure elsewhere in the budget, but that is our job.  We were elected to make good decisions and give good stewardship of taxpayers' money.  Let us try to do that with some sense of collective responsibility.</p><p>I get concerned when we agree priorities.  In the Stormont House Agreement, for example, we sat down and agreed budgets with the Government.  We then brought them back, and, in the period after that, there were different votes, squabbles and point scoring.  The people of Northern Ireland are looking to us to be on the side of the householder, to try to retain as much money as there is in a household, and to scotch the fear of families having to find &#163;400 if there were to be an additional water charge.</p><p>Trevor Clarke's contribution was very strong.  We look towards not only efficiencies but affordability.  We want to support where we can, and we want to protect where we can.  We also want to move forward in a range of other areas of government to ensure that the burden comes off the family.  We want to use measures to help families to bring in more income for themselves.  The importance of water as a collective right, or variations on that theme, was brought out by Se&#225;n Lynch and John Dallat.</p><p>The cost and how we would cover it was brought out by Lord Morrow.</p><p>I want to be fair on this: I think that Chris Lyttle clarified the position when he said that the Alliance Party was not bringing water charges forward at this time.  That may be where the confusion arose, if I am genuine, because the issue seemed to be that there would not be charges.  Then, I think, there was some discussion in the Alliance Party about revenue raising, and, possibly because of an election, the situation seems to be, \"We'll not charge you there, but we'll charge you here\".  That is not revenue raising; that is revenue-neutral.  If it was revenue raising, it was revenue raising.  However, the important thing is that today the Assembly, collectively, can tell people that we reaffirm our rejection of the imposition of water charges on the people of Northern Ireland.  That rejection was reaffirmed by Mr Byrne.</p><p>We had a colourful contribution from Mr McCallister, who said that he would not give a penny more.  Anybody who makes that type of statement is so far out of touch.  I talk to the hospitals across Northern Ireland, and I have family members working in them; I look at the schools across Northern Ireland; I look at the investment that we need in childcare; and I look at how much more we can do on top of what we already do to attract foreign direct investment.

Frankly, that ranks as a political naivety if not, in political terms, a political stupidity.</p><p>We can all rant at the difficulties that there have been in the Executive.  What the Member failed to acknowledge was that the Executive have brought more foreign direct investment to this part of the United Kingdom. Until August 2014, we boasted, rightly, that we brought more foreign direct investment per head of population than any other part of the United Kingdom.  Until that point, it was with the exception of the greater London area.  Now we can supersede that with the knowledge that we are, per head of population, attracting more foreign direct investment to Northern Ireland than is going to any other part of the United Kingdom.</p><p>In the rant against the Executive, the Member failed to mention falling unemployment and the 27 months in which, month after month, unemployment has fallen.  I think that it stands at 27 months of falling unemployment.  He failed to mention the investment in childcare and helping people to get back into work.  Additionally, he failed to realise that the Executive work hard to ensure that every household in Northern Ireland has the lowest household charge in the UK.  We are not saying that everything is perfect.  We have major issues and major difficulties, but we want to look to where we can alleviate those burdens.</p><p>The Minister, in a comprehensive and detailed reply, set out the needs that are there.

The scale of the situation is probably best summarised by the estimate of just how much illegal fuel there is in Northern Ireland.  By a conservative estimate, it stands at 12% to 13% of the total.  Thirteen litres out of every 100 litres of fuel in Northern Ireland is believed to be illegal.  I compare that to the other parts of the United Kingdom, where the figure stands at 2% falling into that category.</p><p>Those are shocking figures, by any stretch of the imagination, but especially so when one takes a moment to consider how much tax and duty has been avoided.  One reasonable estimate of the figures suggests that &#163;80 million is lost annually.  Many others that I have spoken to in the field &#8212; and I have spoken to academics, businesses and the people who are selling fuel legitimately &#8212; tell me that the true figure is much higher than that.</p><p>On 31 January 2013, the BBC reported that no one had been subject to a custodial sentence for engaging in fuel laundering in Northern Ireland.  That revelation was made following the discovery of a fuel laundering plant in County Armagh that was capable of producing 25 million litres of laundered fuel, helping those responsible to avoid &#163;18 million in tax and duty in one single 12-month period.</p><p>So allowing for a starting salary of teachers and nurses of somewhere in the region of just over &#163;21,000 a year, this one fuel laundering operation alone could pay for 857 new nurses in our local health service.  With &#163;18 million, we could employ somewhere in the region of an additional 817 new teachers.  I am seeing what somewhere in the region of a quarter of that could do to improve literacy and numeracy in our primary sector and the GCSE sector.  Can you imagine what we could do with 817 new teachers?  These are the proceeds of just one plant over the period of one year.  The people responsible for this theft are inflicting real and lasting damage upon all our public services by their actions.</p><p>Their selfishness is not confined to merely taking money out of the economy and public services.  The criminals responsible for these crimes have no compunctions or scruples about poisoning the environment and the people who live near their illegal operations.  Fuel laundering is a dirty business.  The toxic waste and other dangerous by-products of the process of fuel laundering are immense.  The disposal of such dangerous substances is extremely hazardous for the people who come into contact with them.  Fuel launderers put their own health at risk.  That, for criminals, is a matter for themselves, but we should all be concerned that public services, our firemen and firewomen, our policemen and policewomen and our DOE staff are being put in harm's way by the fuel laundering gangs' illegal actions.  Given the dangerous nature of the substances associated with fuel laundering, it defies belief that any person would choose to casually dump these products into a water supply or to leave them abandoned in places that the public use, such as forest walks and nature trails.  Yet that is precisely what is happening on a day and daily basis.</p><p>On 22 February this year, the 'Sunday Independent' carried a story about the criminal activities of the republican movement in the south Armagh, Louth and Monaghan areas.  The paper showed that four 1,000-litre containers of poison, the by-product of fuel laundering, were dumped in a drain that feeds directly into Lough Ross, which supplies the drinking water for the entirety of Dundalk and parts of south Armagh.  Let me quote what the newspaper article said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"However, sources in south Armagh &#8212; speaking on strict conditions of anonymity &#8212; said that they believe both the Irish and British governments are turning a 'blind eye' to the lethal trade in fuel laundering.\"</p><p>One source said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There's been stuff dumped there for years.  It's the same all round here.  People have complained but nothing happens.\"</p><p>They said that the council come and look at it and do nothing.  They continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It's running straight into the lough and that's the drinking water for Dundalk and Crossmaglen.  The pumping station for the water to Cross[maglen] is just around the shore of the lough from that place.  They're poisoning their own people.\"</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I take that point, which realises starkly the level of toxicity and poisoning of people.</p><p>I hope that all of us across the House make absolutely clear that anyone with information about this criminal activity should come forward and share it with the police on either side of the border.  We welcome the National Crime Agency's involvement in tackling these criminal gangs.  We want everyone to make clear that people should be free to give this information without fear of retaliation to themselves, their businesses or their property.  A full and unambiguous statement is all that will suffice.  There has been some action from the Department of Justice on the issue, and I welcome that.</p><p>However, I think that most people who have looked at the situation agree that, so far, the fight is not being won by the legitimate forces of law and order.  Rather, as we sit here today, the gangsters have the upper hand.  Measures designed to go after the distributors of illegal fuels are fine insofar as they go, but people want to see the problem tackled at source.  Measures such as the introduction of a new fuel marker that is harder to wash out, which was announced by the Government in February last year, are welcome.  However, as I have communicated directly to the British Government, I have been contacted by businesses that indicate that they have a superior marker.  The best marker should be used.  I have also been contacted by leading academics, sat with them and discussed it.  It is not good enough to have a marker that can be washed out by anybody with basic GCSE chemistry skills.

In this piece of work, all eight jurisdictions were visited and the models of good practice were examined, tested and audited.  The two particular pieces of good practice, which go on day and daily and for which Northern Ireland, in many ways, stands head and shoulders above others, are the work that the Commissioner for Older People is doing and the work of the telepresence robot, which, as I said earlier, facilitates older people not to have to go through that level of displacement and transportation and all the difficulties that that can bring about.  It keeps people in their own areas, closer to their families and with their communities, which is the best model, in many cases, for helping an older person to heal.  Those were the two practical examples.</p><p>Each jurisdiction is visited, the models are examined, and then they are brought together.  I am glad that the Member has welcomed the need for preventative spend.  That will put a huge challenge to us all in the House.  The easiest thing to do would be to continue to throw money at an existing model, but, if we are going to future-proof the needs of elderly people in our society, throwing money at the current model will not meet their needs.  A paradigm shift needs to take place where we move towards preventative spend.  Initially, this will cause difficulties, because when you slice a cake, there are only so many ways to do it.  If you move more money into preventative spend, you have to take it from elsewhere.  Unless we make that paradigm shift in health, particularly for the elder care sector, in order to put more money into prevention, the cost will become very difficult to bear in the future.

I will answer it in two words:  loneliness and isolation.  They are probably interlinked.  When I think of the health service, preventative spend and what we can do to try to ease the burden and make all our lives, including older people's lives, healthier, there are certain things that stick out.  Obesity is a major problem for the health service.  Many of us, me included, are carrying too much weight.  Then, there is alcohol abuse and smoking.  Those are the three things that stick out to all of us as the issues that we are all talking about.</p><p>What surprised me at the meeting with the professionals and in the work that our officials did very well in the working group was that isolation and loneliness are as big killers &#8212; I use the word advisedly &#8212; of our elderly people as obesity, smoking and alcohol abuse.  That came from a professional recommendation.  It puts a major challenge on all of us as to what we do with older people whom we care for in our families.  Can we realise and focus on it for a moment?  Isolation and loneliness are as much of a killer of our elderly people as some of the difficulties encountered with alcohol abuse, smoking and obesity.  Again, another paradigm shift needs to take place so that, when giving resources, we look at what we spend but also at what networks we currently have.  How can we use what we already have to make sure that isolation and loneliness are no longer such a major threat to our elderly people?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statements: British-Irish Council: Social Inclusion Work Sector"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for his question because I think it highlights the contributions that carers make in our society, which, all too often, we forget.  It is not hyperbole to say that, as the Member indicates in his question, unless carers are properly supported, the health and social care system would literally collapse without their contribution.  I know that the Member for East Belfast talked about the actual meeting coming later on, but the next meeting of the work sector that will look at that should take place in two months' time in Edinburgh.</p><p>There are a couple of things.  First of all, we need to speak to carers to find out where the gaps in their support are.  Secondly, we need to find out what training and resources they actually need.  In many cases, it will be physical equipment, and, in other cases, it will be training that they need, because often many carers find themselves in the situation because they just happen to be a family member.  I saw it in my own family as well.  What training does that person actually need?  Thirdly, I do not want to do the work sector's work for it here at the minute, but, if we look at the cost of what it takes to bring a person into hospital and the difficulties that that causes in not having other operational work carried out because beds are not available, add up all of that cost and examine it against the cost of properly financially supporting a carer within the person's own home, we could well find out that, if we do it properly, we could not only do it well but do it at less cost and provide a better flow.</p><p>I speak to older people as part of the responsibility that we have in ministerial office.  None of them wants to stay in hospital.  They often stay in hospital because the provision of care in their own home would be inadequate to meet the dignity of what they need.  Many people out there in the health service and the private sector have the skills to help keep a person in their home at a fraction of what it would cost to use a care facility or a hospital.  In the future, in preventative spend, we need to look at what a person needs and what standards of quality they need in their care.  It is not just a question of a cheaper service.  What is the standard that we expect an older person to have?  What is the training level that we need to give to a person to meet that standard?  What financial resource do we need to give that carer, so that, if they have to give up work to care for somebody, as happens in many cases, they can get adequate financial support for their own families to allow them to care for the person they love?  Those are the models that we are going to have to look at in the future.</p><p>We know that older people want to spend as much time with their families as possible.  We know that, not always but in the majority of cases, older people are telling us consistently that they want to live in their own homes and within their own communities because that is where they get physical, mental and psychological stimulation and draw emotional support.  We need to ask how we redraw a model that says, \"Instead of caring for you when you take sick, we will put in resources so that we can care for you to prevent you getting sick.\"</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statements: British-Irish Council: Social Inclusion Work Sector"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>In accordance with the requirements of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, I wish to make the following statement on the sixth ministerial meeting of the British-Irish Council (BIC) social inclusion work sector, which took place in Edinburgh on 11 March 2015.

One is that no one size fits all.  We have taken approaches in Northern Ireland such as having the Commissioner for Older People, which is recognised across the House and, more importantly, by the elder care sector to have been a huge success and an excellent piece of legislation that has translated into excellent practice by Commissioner Claire Keatinge and her staff and by the elder care sector that provide them with advice and support.</p><p>No single model will fit everywhere.  We need to look to where future needs will lie.  We know that there are major concerns around social isolation, loneliness and the impact that these place on physical and mental health.  There are many models of governments looking at the networks and support systems they already have, and putting money in early to prevent some of the later problems that will come about if they do not do it.  It is not something that we have the option not to do.  Preventative spend is the key to how we can deliver a service, to our elderly people, that is fit for purpose into the future.</p><p>To answer Mr Moutray's question directly:  preventative spend is the key future intervention.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statements: British-Irish Council: Social Inclusion Work Sector"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>The Member has probably hit on the two critical factors for elderly people:  \"meet\" to combat social isolation and loneliness, and the fact that, because older people are, in many cases, not in work environments, they have to heat their own homes.

Basically, it allows people to be remotely assessed by a consultant in a different venue, who is given a clear and accurate picture of their symptoms and vital signs, so that they have an interaction without being displaced.  That is the first critical model.</p><p>Secondly, we realise that we face a huge problem, not just in Northern Ireland, but in Guernsey, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, with severe loneliness in our ageing population.  There are a number of mechanisms to deal with that.  One was the concept of the men's shed, of which we have an example in Northern Ireland.  I spoke to those who run the men's shed in Belfast Castle, which is a facility for groups of men to meet through different initiatives, such as crafts.  Service users reported that it was a lifeline.</p><p>We have to ensure, finally, that there is proper financial provision for the elderly, because diet is critical to their well-being; that is a given.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statements: British-Irish Council: Social Inclusion Work Sector"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>It is a strong question, Mr Speaker.  First, what my Department does in the active ageing strategy will be embedded in the work of all other Departments, because, as the Member will know as a former Minister, once it is agreed at the Executive, it becomes an Executive strategy and all other Departments are obliged, and would want, to take it forward.</p><p>I pay tribute to the active ageing working group, which is working alongside us.  The group has asked for a further meeting, which why we have not brought the strategy forward just yet.  We will have one further meeting before bringing the strategy forward together.  It is based on ensuring that older people can maximise their personal independence.  We have already involved older people and the age sector in the decision-making.  From the very beginning, the strategy has been informed by the views of older people to ensure their participation in the work of government for their future.  We know that, in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, there is an issue with care, particularly how it is received in the home or the community &#8212; wherever works best.</p><p>Some of the examples that we have used from other Departments are taken from spatial planning, in particular.</p><p>Spatial planning is not solely for older people.  A person close to me has multiple sclerosis, and I know about some of the difficulties that can occur when you push a wheelchair.  You can see the spatial difficulties that exist for people when it comes to parking, when roads are half blocked by cars, when obstacles are left on roads or when you have to negotiate your way around wheelie bins and those sorts of things.  There are practical things that we can do in our future spatial planning, not only for this sector but for many other people, such as mothers with prams and buggies and different things.</p><p>In the older persons' sector, we want to move towards self-fulfilment.  We want to consult with older people to see how we can maximise their potential and their contribution.  The final piece of work that we are doing, which contributes to the United Nations Principles for Older Persons, is to do with dignity.  How do we make sure that the care that an older person gets maximises the dignity that we can offer to them?  That work will all be taken forward in the active ageing strategy and will be embedded into the work of all the other Departments.  A lot of what is in the strategy will come before you all shortly and, because it was informed by older people, it will help us to deliver more for older people in our society.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statements: British-Irish Council: Social Inclusion Work Sector"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>If people care to take a serious look at what we have done on racial equality, at the funding that we have secured for the minority ethnic development fund or at my diary for the last four years &#8212; be it work with the Chinese community, at the Belfast Mela with the Indian community, with the Somali community or with the representative legal bodies &#8212; they will see the level of priority that has been attached to the work that we have undertaken.

There was the expansion of the Sure Start programme to the top 25% most deprived wards &#8212; previously, it was the top 20% &#8212; and that is under way.  Secondly, the Bright Start childcare grant scheme was launched in March 2014, and, to date, nearly &#163;2 million has been allocated to it.

Speaking today as Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, I welcome this coordinated report by the Committee for Finance and Personnel on sickness absence in the public sector here.  The review arose from a referral by the PAC of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on sickness absence in the public sector.  PAC reported on sickness absence in the previous mandates, and it welcomes the Committee for Finance and Personnel's report, which provides a renewed and timely focus on such an important issue in the public sector.</p><p>The health and well-being of the NI Civil Service workforce is crucial to the effective delivery of our public services, and staff sickness absence considerably reduces Departments' productivity, affects services right across and carries a significant financial cost.  Therefore, it is important that Departments and the wider public sector protect the health of our workforce and manage sickness absence effectively.</p><p>Some degree of absence is inevitable, and that is accepted when employees are sick and should not come to work.  Effective management can, however, help to minimise absence by ensuring that any causes of work-related ill health are addressed and staff helped back to work as soon as possible.</p><p>I welcome the fact that, overall, the report shows a declining trend.  However, I am concerned that we are still not meeting our targets.  The Audit Office estimates that sickness absence costs the public purse &#163;150 million a year across the Civil Service, health trusts and the education sector at a time of ever-increasing pressure on essential public services.  It is unacceptable that the cost of sick absence was &#163;73 million to our health trusts, &#163;46 million to the education sector and &#163;30 million to the Civil Service.</p><p>While targets have been set in all three sectors, it is disappointing that achievement of them has not been consistent.  The Civil Service, for example, had a five-year target to reduce overall absence to 9&#183;5 days a year but did not manage to achieve that.  Three of the six trusts did not manage to achieve their targets during the period, and the education authorities did not manage to achieve their targets for teacher absence in 2010-11 and 2011-12.</p><p>In 2010, the Public Accounts Committee published a follow-up report on the management of substitution cover for teachers, in which it recommended measures relating to sick absence among teachers.  Clearly, more work needs to be done to address sick absence, which cost &#163;12 million in teacher substitute cover in 2011-12.</p><p>I welcome the Committee's finding that good practice policies exist in the Civil Service.  However, they need to be applied more rigorously and consistently within and across Departments.  Long-term sickness absence remains a significant issue and accounts for 70% of days lost in the Civil Service, 66% in health and social care trusts and 60% among teachers.  In view of the impact of long-term sickness, I support the Committee's call for the Minister of Finance and Personnel and the wider Executive to place a higher priority on reducing long-term sickness absence rates in the NI Civil Service, especially through measures to address mental health issues, which are a significant cause of long-term sick absence in the public sector.</p><p>The Committee for Education undertook separate scrutiny of sickness absence in the Department of Education and wider education sector.  Today's report echoes support for measures recommended in the Education Committee's report.  I strongly urge that the measures recommended in all those reports are taken forward so that realistic targets can be set that will drive forward improvement in reducing sickness absence across the education sector.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Sickness Absence in the Northern Ireland Public Sector"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>2.

We need a unified voice coming out of the north-west region demanding what should have been delivered 50 years ago, and, by working together, we can achieve it.  Go raibh m&#237;le maith agat.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Magee Campus: Ulster University"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Like my colleagues, I am fully in support of the expansion of Magee.  There is no doubt that the future economic development of the new Derry City and Strabane District Council is connected with the expansion of the Magee campus, so it is essential that we work together to see that expansion delivered.  Sinn F&#233;in has made it clear that it will support any bid that is brought to the Executive for Magee expansion funding.  I welcome that the Minister is scrutinising the business plan for the expansion of the Magee campus. I also welcome the fact that, if it meets the expenditure appraisal and evaluation criteria, he will bid for funds for it in the next comprehensive spending review.  I have no doubt that the business plan put forward to the Minister is robust and that, when he makes his decision, he will have the Sinn F&#233;in Ministers' support for any subsequent bid.</p><p>We are now in a new era and situation, with the deputy First Minister determined to deliver on the Magee project.  We have the new expanded Derry City and Strabane District Council, with increased powers coming on stream from April.  The political landscape will then be reconfigured.  All that allows for a new focus.  Magee, as you know, a Cheann Comhairle, is a cross-border campus, and it plays a major part in the north-west education gateway initiative through its ability to attract students.  The new Derry City and Strabane District Council's integrated economic strategy will also have a clear focus on the Magee expansion, as I said.  In turn, that will be complemented by the North West Regional College's ambitions to provide accreditation for its pupils in the STEM subjects to allow them to step up to degree courses at Magee.</p><p>Sinn F&#233;in has made a commitment to do everything within its power to improve the lives of all our citizens and to redress the impact that generations of neglect have had on places like Strabane, Derry and the north-west as a whole.  That is why Sinn F&#233;in is leading the way on issues like decentralisation, with the Agriculture Minister, Michelle O'Neill, relocating an entire Department right into the heart of the north-west.</p><p>That is why Martin McGuinness initiated an Executive subgroup on regional economic disparities, which is driving a unified ministerial approach to issues such as the expansion of Magee, the A5 road project, transport infrastructure and so on.  I would like to make the point that my party colleague Mr Barry McElduff is in Dublin today meeting the Taoiseach Enda Kenny on a number of issues, one of which is the A5.</p><p>The establishment of the subgroup on the north-west will drive the process of change that will deliver the political authority needed in the Magee campaign.  As my party colleague from Foyle said earlier, it is no accident that Mr McGuinness invited the further education Minister on to the subgroup, and I believe that the acceptance by the Minister to be part of that group demonstrates that he is at least willing to pursue the case for expansion.</p><p>He has already indicated his intention to bid within months for the &#163;11 million required to construct the new teaching block at Magee this year.  That bid will certainly be supported by my Sinn F&#233;in colleagues on the Executive, as it would present a major investment and physical expansion at Magee.  The Minister also signalled the potential for a significant increase in student numbers in the new Assembly mandate, which begins next year.  In order to achieve that, we need to consolidate the political will, which the subgroup initiative has helped to generate.  That is the best way to ensure that Magee is prioritised by all Executive Ministers.</p><p>Many young people from my area of Strabane and the north-west have to travel to Belfast and elsewhere due to many courses not being available locally in Magee.  Indeed, the expansion of Magee would benefit the north-west, as we could retain many of our young people locally.  It would save on travel expenses and other finances that they have to spend if they have to travel elsewhere, and it would almost certainly attract more students to the area.</p><p>The expansion of Magee is a crucial part of the One Plan &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Magee Campus: Ulster University"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  There is no doubt that securing economic recovery, prosperity and equality is at the heart of our approach to the Budget and the provision of public services.  Economic recovery is self-evidently critical to our success and is the route to improving the lives of our people.  What we want is economic success through well-paid jobs for our people.  Capital investment, improving access to finance and restoring business and consumer confidence are all central to attracting new businesses to the North and, indeed, the island, and supporting the business that we already have here, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.  That is why we need to ensure that we prioritise infrastructure investment by ensuring that, in the context of fiscal accountability, we consider the best ways to ensure that we can benefit from the European Investment Bank, can find new, innovative ways to invest in social housing and can find sustainable measures to increase our local revenue base by exploring the potential for new levies, which would have a positive impact on society.</p><p>It must be said that, at a time when the Westminster Government have cut our resources by &#163;1&#183;5 billion, it is essential that we focus on delivering better outcomes from the resources that we have.  We must move beyond bookkeeping to drive economic growth.  That means working collectively to exploit every avenue that we have to build a progressive, strong revenue base that does not harm but strengthens our people, our competitiveness, our economic security and, indeed, our economic growth.</p><p>We want to build a society in which income and wealth inequality are low and social cohesion is high, pay is higher, poverty is very low and the local tax take is higher and enables strong public services without endemic debt and deficit; and a strong welfare state in which public services are extensive, well funded and generally universally available and in which finance is seen as a means to sustain industry and provide financial security for individuals, not as a speculative means of profit maximisation.</p><p>We want a diverse economy with a balanced portfolio of industry sectors, with much more emphasis on product innovation, a much larger medium-sized industry sector with a more diverse ownership profile, including more extensive public and community ownership and cooperatives, and in which a more mutual and coordinated approach to economic development is taken.</p><p>At present, we make decisions that improve the local economy through, for example, job creation.  The receipts go to the British Exchequer and do not enter our local Budget, yet it is our actions and local decisions that lead to the increase in the receipts.  Through the Smith commission, Scotland will stand to benefit from policy decisions taken in Scotland.  Why should we be any different?  Collectively, we need to demand similar provisions for our local economy from the British Government.  Imagine the benefits to our local Budget if we eradicated low pay through the provision of the living wage.  Not only would we lift the 173,000 workers earning below the living wage out of the struggle of in-work poverty but we would generate &#163;88 million in direct taxes and reduce benefit and tax credit payments, which would be returned to the British Exchequer.  If that finance was repatriated locally, it would substantially boost our local budgets.  It would, for example, pay for more than 3,500 nurses or teachers, or we could use the finance to pay for universal childcare and open up the labour market fully to parents.</p><p>Universities offer another illustration.  Increased investment in research and development, along with tailored support for entrepreneurship, could lead to an increase in innovative small and medium-sized enterprises, which are important to creating high-skilled jobs, reversing the brain drain and boosting the economy.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant: Reductions"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>It is important that the Northern Executive and the people of the North receive the full return on their investment through increased income tax, National Insurance or corporation tax revenue.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to the motion.  There is no doubt about it that 7 May is fast approaching, and, as we know, there is much uncertainty about the type of government that will be formed at Westminster.  Indeed, it seems likely that Northern Ireland parties will have a key role in affairs at Westminster after the election.</p><p>The austerity policy pursued by the Tory coalition for the past five years has led to a huge fall in standards here more than anywhere else.  Claims of an economic recovery have meant little to people who are on zero-hours contracts, on the minimum wage or unemployed.  Report after report has indicated how hard we have been hit by the recession.  It has been deeper here than elsewhere, and recovery has been slower.  The situation here has been made worse by the reduction of &#163;1&#183;5 billion from the block grant.</p><p>Although the SDLP's amendment was not accepted, I will refer to it in my speech.  Whilst we support the motion, I note, as I said, that the votes of MPs returned from Northern Ireland could be decisive in deciding the type of government at Westminster after the election.  Our MPs will have an important role to play in holding the next government to account and in making their votes count.</p><p>The motion is right to call on the British Government to pursue a policy of economic stimulus rather than attacking our public services through reductions in the block grant.  Austerity is a dead hand on economic development and serves only to stunt growth and keep us mired in recession.  What we need is a stimulus to growth.  We still have threats to the jobs of 1,500 teachers and 1,000 classroom assistants, and we are also looking at a &#163;1&#183;3 million reduction in the early years budget.</p><p>Civic society has an important role in informing, advising and scrutinising government.  Trade unions, businesses, employers and the voluntary and community sector have done much lobbying to ensure that the anti-austerity message gets across to the British Government.</p><p>As I said, the results of the election are important, but the difference will be in how our MPs use their votes.  It is ironic that the motion comes from a party that refuses to take its seats in the House of Commons, refuses to bring the fight to the Government where it can make a real difference &#8212; on the Floor of the House of Commons &#8212; and prefers to shout from the sidelines rather than engage where it matters &#8212; on the Floor of the House of Commons.  It is more than a touch ironic for Sinn F&#233;in to appeal to civic society in the form of the voluntary and community sector, employers and trade unions to take up the cudgel when it refuses to use its mandate to vote against these measures where it matters &#8212; on the Floor of the House of Commons.</p><p>Although we agree with the motion, it has a hollow ring to it, coming as it does from a party that will not go the full distance in the fight against austerity.  What is the point of the motion?  While its sentiments are good and wise, its purpose seems to be more to do with protecting Sinn F&#233;in from criticism.  However, we believe, as I said, that the sentiments at the heart of the motion are the right sentiments, which we should support &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>&#8212; and support on the Floor of the House of Commons at the beginning of the next mandate.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.

I, too, welcome the opportunity, as one of the only two female representatives on the Assembly and Executive Review Committee, to talk about our review on women in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I thank everyone who was involved in what has culminated in what we have before us.  I thank the Committee Clerks, those who provided us with written and oral evidence and the Icelandic Parliament and the Welsh Parliament for their valuable help.

We will be very fortunate if we get as much as five seconds on the news tonight, but let us hope that someone out there actually sees that this issue is equally important to the others that will be discussed today.</p><p>Under the terms of reference, we examined the barriers that women face when entering politics, with particular reference to the Northern Ireland Assembly, initiatives to assist women entering politics, including positive actions, and the role of current Members.  You will note from the Committee's conclusions that it was agreed unanimously that under-representation of women must be addressed by the Assembly as a matter of urgency.</p><p>I will turn to the submissions received in relation to the barriers that women face when entering politics, which are under the following headings:  institutional barriers; political barriers; socio-economic barriers; and individual or psychological barriers.  Like many other female Members in the Chamber, I go out regularly to speak, especially to women's groups &#8212; especially to young women's groups &#8212; and the feedback I get time and again is the great barrier that women face and how we are projected as women in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I remember being at an event not that long ago that was run by the Northern Ireland Women's European Platform (NIWEP) and Youth Action in the MAC, and Megan Fearon was with me at that event.</p><p>I sat with a group of young educated women, and their explanation of a politician was as follows:  middle-aged, middle class, graduate and male.  I thought, \"Oh my goodness, is that the message we are putting out from the Assembly; is that a true representation of what we are in Northern Ireland?\"  I went on to tell them that I grew up in a working-class family, lived in a housing estate and was a single parent of two children by the age of 23, and still managed to break into political life and still managed to have an important role in the Assembly.</p><p>I think that we need to dispel a lot of the myths that surround politicians in Stormont.  We also need to look at our culture in Northern Ireland.  We have a culture were the woman's role is seen very much as the caring role, which we are, and, of course, I am happy to be that, but we are so much more than that.  We are so much better &#8212; not that we are better than that but that we are more than that.  We have so much to say and so much to give.</p><p>Working with our local communities, I see an underlying current of strong, capable women who want to put their point of view across but are so much put off by this political institution and what it is.

It is, I suppose, inconceivable that men outnumber women in high-level STEM positions by nearly 3:1, but that stark reality goes deeper than the high-level positions.  In most spheres of life and for a number of reasons, women have been relegated to the sidelines and have got used to watching on as men fulfil roles and do jobs that they feel they are incapable of doing. Many underlying beliefs accompany that gender imbalance.  Traditionally, from an early age, there are roles that are seen as male and those that are seen as female.  That is also transferred into the workplace.  Many jobs are seen as traditionally female or traditionally male, and that entrenched notion has filtered down many generations.  To change that, we need to break the pattern by radically addressing the underlying issues that lead to such imbalance in our workforce.</p><p>The future success of the Northern Ireland economy depends on increasing numbers of skilled workers in the STEM sector.  That means that we must encourage all our young people, especially girls, into that area.  Of course, that starts at the primary school level.  Rather than persuading our girls to go down more traditional routes, we need to actively promote all school subjects as being enjoyable and accessible to all.  To realistically achieve that, I agree with the suggestions in the report by Queen's University entitled 'Addressing Gender Balance - Reaping the Gender Dividend in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', which was published in 2013. It pushes for a greater collaborative effort by businesses, government and education to engage, encourage and inspire young women and girls.  Collaboration is the key point.</p><p>We need to look to other countries that have already seriously started to address the issue.  In the United States of America, the National Girls Collaborative Project was set up to actively promote girls' participation in STEM projects, culminating in STEM careers.  That body addressed all the issues that have detracted from a workforce in which women lead the way in STEM.  In the UK, the Women in to Science and Engineering (WISE) campaign actively seeks to increase the gender balance in the UK's STEM workforce from 13% to 20% by 2020. In light of the types of body that have been set up in other places, I feel that it is time for a similar body to be put in place specifically to address this problem in Northern Ireland.  Today, I call on the Minister to develop a DEL-backed collaborative project in conjunction with the main universities here to bring together all the main stakeholders of government, business and education to have a focused, progressive and innovative approach to redressing the imbalance.</p><p>It is imperative that this is done as soon as possible to encourage females into the STEM sector.  Women are very important to the STEM sector.  As an economic driver going forward, it makes good business sense.  By recruiting more women, the workforce talent pool is enlarged, which ensures that recruiters can employ the best staff they need for their work.  Women make up half the population.  By having such a small group of women employed in the STEM industrial sector, businesses miss out on the needs of customers, as their staff are male-dominated and are not best placed to understand the needs of female customers.</p><p>I believe that there is a way forward.  There is something that the Minister, his Department and his Executive colleagues need to do.

Minimising poverty, inequality, social exclusion and disadvantage, especially among vulnerable groups in isolated rural communities, is a policy priority in the rural White Paper action plan, and there is no doubt that, through the TRPSI framework, there is clear evidence that policy documents can become a reality and provide tangible benefits for those in greatest need.  We have seen that happen with the TRPSI programme.</p><p>Unfortunately, poverty and isolation exist throughout all arts and parts of Northern Ireland, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution to that problem.  In urban areas, for example, a clear trend of poverty and isolation exists in certain geographical boundaries, where there are areas of affluence and poverty.  While those areas can be fairly easily defined and initiatives can be put in place to target the problem, it is not the same in rural areas as no such boundaries exist, which leaves it much more difficult to tackle the problems that rural dwellers face.</p><p>No one in the House will be under any illusion as to the pressure that the farming community has been under over the past few years.  Year on year, they have been squeezed so far as getting a reasonable price for their product is concerned and that, added to the difficulties posed by banks, has left many farming families struggling.  Indeed, it has driven some to the point of despair.</p><p>Isolation, loneliness and economic pressures have had a substantial impact on farming families and the entire rural community.  The Northern Ireland continuous household survey highlighted the fact that not only is there a growing number of people living alone but the number of people between the ages of 16 and 59 who live alone has doubled in the past 30 years.  There is no doubt that that, along with the ageing population, is a contributing factor to rural isolation and loneliness.  The challenge to all Departments is to work in tandem with each another to deliver for those who find themselves in such circumstances.</p><p>It is only right and proper that we acknowledge and recognise the good work that has been done through the Rural Community Network and the MARA project, as so many in the Chamber have done this evening.  That work now needs to be developed further and built on.  Figures show that MARA has visited some 14,000 households and helped deliver on the warm homes scheme, welfare benefits and boiler replacements to a total of &#163;3&#183;2 million.  Its strength and success is its ability to tap into local knowledge and expertise and to do so quickly and effectively.</p><p>As we move forward in addressing the issue in rural areas, it is important to note what other stakeholders said when they came before the Committee.  The Ulster Farmers' Union said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"While it is right and proper that DARD should continue to take the lead on this issue, we believe that there needs to be a joined-up approach to this issue.

Right across Northern Ireland, there appears to be an apathetic acceptance that the north-west is an area of deprivation and will continue to be so.  It is up to us, as political representatives, to change our outlook and begin to believe that we do not have to accept the status quo and that, step by step, that must and will change.  Sometimes the negativity is brought about by public representatives who present a poor image of the area rather than coming forward and spelling out the good work that has been done.</p><p>The One Plan seeks to address the underlying issues that have contributed to the vicious circle of negativity.  Core problem elements are emphasised and clearly identified aims are outlined in the plan.  It is now the responsibility of the Minister for Employment and Learning to examine all the options for supporting the One Plan target that are at his disposal.  Despite the aims and objectives clearly outlined in the One Plan, the reality is that, without funding and investment, none of it can be implemented. Most of the funding for that ambitious plan will come from the public purse.  With that in mind, a more flexible format of higher education in the north-west is necessary, and its design and delivery must move towards a more community-focused partnership.  The traditional roles of separate, autonomous institutions will have to merge ideas and strategies to change the educational landscape.  In a rapidly changing world, collaboration is key to success in the educational spectrum.</p><p>Forging links with industry and business is fundamental to the Ulster University.  Its portfolios of courses are vocationally applied to match industrial needs.  For the duration of courses, employability is always in mind.  All the university programmes are continuously re-evaluated, and professional practice is a core part of university degrees, with designated hours of work-based learning as component modules.  Businesses are encouraged to work alongside the university to develop their work-based learning programmes, which, in turn, meet the needs of local employers through their input into the courses.  Ulster University has a reputation for work-based access, and I believe that that is the route to the future for our children, who will come out of university equipped with all the necessary tools to gain meaningful employment in the area. If we want to address all the difficulties in the north-west, we must work together to bring about &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Magee Campus: Ulster University"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>&#8212; the change that is required for the economy and for the young people in that area.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Magee Campus: Ulster University"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>I beg to move the following amendment:</p><p class=\"italic\">Leave out all after \"report;\" and insert:\n\n\"notes the commitment within the One Plan to an expansion to 9,400 full-time equivalent students by 2020 and increasing the maximum student number by 1,000 by 2015; and calls on the Minister for Employment and Learning to examine the options for supporting the One Plan target.\".</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate and move the amendment to the motion.  The reason for the amendment is simply that the original motion is full of aspiration that can only be delivered through significant investment from the public purse.  Under the economic conditions that we find ourselves in, all Departments are restricted by their available resources.</p><p>It is with that economic backdrop in mind that I believe that the best way to drive and expand economic growth in the north-west region of Northern Ireland is to incorporate a multi-agency approach whereby the Minister for Employment and Learning examines all the options for supporting the One Plan target.</p><p>The north-west of Northern Ireland has suffered decades of neglect right across the board in infrastructure and skills. On behalf of my constituency of West Tyrone, I join the call for the Executive to support the collaborative efforts of balanced regional growth across the Province, looking objectively at the underlying core issues that mean that the north-west area of Northern Ireland consistently sits at the bottom of league tables for economic fundamentals.  I suggest that these are engrained, long-standing issues that cannot be resolved overnight.</p><p>The One Plan is an ambitious project that seeks to address these problems.  I agree with the core areas behind the One Plan commitment.  It is good to see clearly identified aims and objectives that seek to redress the imbalance that has been out of sync with the rest of Northern Ireland for far too long.  Ulster University at Magee has an increasing and commendable track record of placing graduates in employment.  In line with the DEL HE strategy, all undergraduates need work experience as part of their course. Ulster University is in the process of implementing compulsory work placements and work-based learning in all its courses.  These proactive measures, which are advantageous in improving a student's chance of employment in the future, are welcome.  Any student will tell us that they will choose a programme of study that reflects a good return on the investment of time, energy and financial aspects during their study at university.  Increasingly, Ulster University has reflected current economic and employment needs in its portfolio of courses.  It has worked with local employers to reflect the changing needs in the local economic area.  This is one of the recommendations of the One Plan that is in process in the university.  Collaboration potential between academia and business is a core element of the plan.  For the future landscape of HE, traditional academic and cultural boundaries need to be transcended to improve access for people from across the community.  In conjunction with that, links with FE and schools must always be strengthened.</p><p>On closer examination of the figures, we see that unemployment is constantly higher in the west of Northern Ireland.  It is imperative that we tackle this unacceptably high level of unemployment.  Short-term measures needed to upskill this section of our society are addressed in the One Plan for Londonderry in the core area of education to the higher education sector.  The skills agenda is core to the One Plan, which will help people, especially disadvantaged and unemployed people, to get into work and remain in the workplace.  Higher education, however, is only one strand of an interconnected band of issues that can contribute to driving economic growth in the north-west.  The One Plan highlights key areas that are necessary for renewal in the north-west and incorporates economic, social and physical elements within its boundaries.  The key focus is on building a stronger and more vibrant economy. We can all aspire to that for this area.</p><p>For long-term sustainability and to act as a catalyst for economic growth across the north-west, I call on the Assembly to look further than simply addressing the immediate issue.  The expansion of Magee college will not be the answer to all the problems in the region; no one in the House is naive enough to believe that.  To effect change in the long term, it is necessary to adopt a longer-term focus.  The One Plan project is extremely ambitious.  While I agree that it raises clear underlying issues, the amendment not only addresses the commitment of the One Plan ultimately to expand the Magee campus by 2020 but calls on the Minister for Employment and Learning to examine all the options available to him to ensure that the core elements of the plan are addressed within the remit of his Department.</p><p>It seems to me that this is where we must start to tackle the long-standing problems that previous generations have encountered.  It is not too late to start to motivate, teach and enable children to understand that everything that they need to get out of the vicious cycle of social deprivation and neglect comes through change.  They must change to bring about the long-term sustainability that is required.  Within the ambitious aspirations and answers to the critical questions that the One Plan seeks to address, we need to examine the sources of funding for the project.  Public finances will be the main driver behind implementing those changes.</p><p>The north-west of Northern Ireland has always been known for negative reasons.  It is known as an economic black spot and recognised for having the highest level of economic inactivity and poor infrastructure.  We could go on and on.

Water rates is a very contentious issue in Ireland.  Many members of the public believe that they pay for domestic water through the current rating system. Obviously, commercial water rates are charged for through metering, and it is generally accepted that the political consensus in Northern Ireland is that there should be no direct charge to private consumers for water.</p><p>On Saturday past, we once again bore witness to the fury of the population in the Republic, as 10,000 people took to the streets to protest against the Government's current plan to implement water charges.  I can only imagine similar outrage in Northern Ireland, unless the Assembly and the Executive reaffirm their commitment today to reject water rates.  No one in Northern Ireland wants to see a water-charging system that could lead the way to a privatised water company being formed in the future, and that is the worry.</p><p>I recognise that, for the past several years, water meters have been introduced in towns throughout Northern Ireland.  Last January, I asked the Minister how many water meters had been installed in my constituency of West Tyrone.  Although the Minister was unable to tell me the exact figure, he was able to tell me that over 32,000 domestic meters had been installed in Northern Ireland since 2007.  The supposed reasoning for that was that new homes being connected to the water supply are required, through article 81 of the Water and Sewerage Services Order 2006, to have water meters.  The Minister has confirmed that, as yet, those meters only record the consumption of water and have not been set up to ease the imposition of potential charges.  I welcome the Minister for Regional Development's response on the issue, and I hope that he remembers that the people of Northern Ireland will not tolerate the creation of a charge infrastructure that seeks to impose water charges for domestic users by the back door.</p><p>I recognise, of course, that Northern Ireland's water infrastructure is not perfect.  I can see why people may be tempted by the lure of privatisation or new charges to solve our problems.  I reject that reasoning, however, as homes in Northern Ireland already pay at least &#163;160 on average through the rates system for their water supply.  The true problem of Northern Ireland Water stems from the systematic failure to invest properly in our infrastructure over the last 30 to 40 years, although I recognise that there has been capital investment in recent times.</p><p>In 2007, the independent review panel found that infrastructural problems were concentrated west of the Bann and that the west suffered from out-of-date and deteriorating infrastructure that was in desperate need of modernisation.  That was eight years ago, and the situation does not seem to have greatly improved.  The debacle last January demonstrated the difficulties with our water supply in the west.  The same report recognised that there should be no standing or volumetric charges.</p><p>I find it surprising that, once again, the west is being brutalised with infrastructure imbalance.  Much like the traditional economic imbalance, the struggle with deteriorating water infrastructure stems directly from the consistent failure of Assembly Ministers before and after the economic crash to invest properly in infrastructure in the western parts of the North.  I worry that the people of Northern Ireland and specifically those in the west have been neglected and treated without regard and could soon be unfairly asked to pay more for their shabby treatment.</p><p>The people of Northern Ireland deserve access to consistent, safe and reliable water.  That is a basic human right.  The people of Northern Ireland pay for their water through our domestic rates and taxation system.  The people should not be asked to pay again for it.

As many of us will recognise, cycling has seen a resurgence in recent years, with people seeking to use bicycles as their primary mode of transport as well as their primary mode of exercise.  Needless to say, a growing cycling culture in Northern Ireland will have new impacts and raise new issues in areas such as health, public safety, tourism, transport and our regional and local infrastructure.</p><p>The expansion of cycling in Northern Ireland presents an exciting opportunity to develop a market that promotes healthier lifestyles, reduces our carbon footprint and, as my colleague said, opens new areas for Northern Ireland tourism.  In my constituency in the Omagh area, I have already seen the positive effects of this developing sector.  The Omagh Wheelers club is a vibrant collection of cycling enthusiasts who seek to promote cycling as an alternative mode of transport and the best form of exercise.  The club was formed in 1999 with only a handful of members, but it has grown to over 140 members.</p><p>Local clubs regularly organise leisure, competitive and charity events that continually bring crowds and revenue to the local area.  In 2013, for example, the Wheelers promoted around 40 events, including the prestigious all-Ireland vets/junior time trial championships and the junior/A3 road race championship.</p><p>The club's signature event, the McCann Cup, sees an entry of around 300 cyclists across five races and attracts people from all over the island.  This June, the club will help to host the all-Ireland cycling championships, one of the most prestigious racing events in the Irish cycling calendar.  The event will bring world-class cyclists and para-cyclists to Omagh to compete not only for first place but for the honour of wearing the Irish national champion's jersey in this year's Tour de France.  I suspect that the event will bring in an even greater number of spectators, who will spend significant amounts of money and bolster the local economy.  With that in mind, I support the efforts of the Wheelers and the Omagh cycling initiative in promoting greater participation in cycling, better transport planning and in-town development to facilitate cyclists.</p><p>I have spoken about the Omagh Wheelers and the Omagh cycling initiative not simply in admiration of their efforts to promote the sport of cycling but to demonstrate that the cycling phenomenon is real and that its rise is plain to see.  The expansion of cycling means the galvanisation of an economic resource.  For every charity or race event that draws hundreds of people, we see a boost to our local economy.  I believe that this sector needs the support of the Assembly.</p><p>A draft strategy for developing a plan for the future of cycling in Northern Ireland is now timely, and it is good to hear that the Department will, hopefully, bring forward a strategy soon.  The Dublinbikes park-and-hire scheme has been very successful.  It was started some years ago by the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Andrew Montague.  Hopefully, Belfast will have an equally good bicycle scheme in the future.</p><p>As the Committee rightly notes, there is an almost universal acceptance that cycling and an improved cycling infrastructure can mean a significant boost to the economy.  I note how the Department for Transport report, 'Value for Money Assessment for Cycling Grants', has found that cycling schemes can have a benefit:cost ratio of up to 35:1.</p><p>The Committee was unable to come up with any exact figure for the value of cycling to the Northern Ireland economy, but Sustrans estimates a contribution of about &#163;87 million, and the Cyclists' Touring Club mentioned that &#163;300 million to &#163;400 million is an estimate of the economic impact that cycling can have to Northern Ireland.</p><p>I support the Committee's recommendation that the Department must establish a baseline for the current value of cycling to the economy so that we may regularly assess all progress going forward.  I want to mention the comments of the managing director of the Antrim bicycle retailer Chain Reaction, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it would be great to see an increased level of investment in facilities and infrastructure here in Northern Ireland because that would help to support the growth of cycling globally and tourism coming into the area.\"</p><p>It is a sentiment that I support.</p><p>As my fellow Committee members no doubt know, Chain Reaction in Antrim is the world's largest cycling product retailer, selling over 600 brands and 60,000 products to more than 1&#183;5 million customers &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Cycling: Benefits to the Economy"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>&#8212; in over 100 countries by electronic retail.

I am quite certain that it will continue to be the case as we move on.</p><p>There were a number of us who, before the present Minister became the Minister of Health, had either the foresight or the advanced knowledge that he would become the Minister of Health.  We invited him to the Causeway Hospital anyway, to ensure that he would see at first hand the great facilities that there were and that he would be able to speak to the staff and the officials there and indicate his support not just for its retention but its development as a first-class facility.  I think that it was a good move to get the Minister-to-be to come to the hospital and to get him signed up to the future of the Causeway Hospital.  We are glad that he was able to do that.</p><p>Mr Dallat referred to a number of issues, and I may refer to one or two of them along with other issues.  One of the things that sets the Causeway Hospital apart from other acute hospitals is the fact that, between now and September, the catchment population for the Causeway Hospital increases by about 70%, which is not applicable to any of the other acute hospitals across Northern Ireland.  Of course, that is because of the coastal resorts, the thousands upon thousands of caravans that are located on the Causeway Coast and the holiday homes and the second homes that are based on the coast.  It has the capacity to deal with many, many more minor injuries, and it has to do that over a five-month period that other hospitals do not have to deal with.</p><p>There has been a continuing concern, since within two or three years of the Causeway Hospital opening, about its future.  About four or five years ago, for a prolonged period of time, possibly about 12 months, there was a concern that the hospital's future as an acute hospital at all was in considerable doubt.  Campaigns were launched to ensure the retention of the hospital, and, of course, that moment passed.  After that, again for a prolonged period, there was a concern and a fear in the locality that, while the hospital's future was secure, the A&amp;E in the hospital also might be under threat.  Over a period of time, thankfully, with work done on that, that concern has receded, although not disappeared entirely.  I know that a number of us have been in regular contact with the trust and the Health Minister to try to ensure that this hospital is not just retained in the services that it currently provides but builds for the future.</p><p>On this occasion, I concur again with Mr Dallat &#8212; I will make sure that this will not be a repeated offence in that I will concur all the time with Mr Dallat &#8212; about the need to build the relationship between Altnagelvin and Causeway.  So much can be done about that, whether it is maternity services or other services that I know they are looking to develop between the two sites.  This is good and is positive for the future.  The staff at the hospital are magnificent, as they are in each and every unit across Northern Ireland, and we need to offer them our unstinting support.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister what his reaction and response is to the debate and to keep repeating the assurances of the commitment to the site and to develop it.  Of course, as health provision changes into the future, the hospital's staff, the Department, the current Minister and subsequent Ministers will have to adapt to the changing needs.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>I recommend the Adjournment debate to the Minister, and hopefully he will be able to respond positively to it.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>The Minister will be aware of the particular skills that were deployed by personnel in car parking under the prior arrangement.

I thank Members for their attendance.</p><p>Obviously, the motion is primarily about the introduction or, as I hope, the non-introduction of water charges.  It is to be welcomed that, until now, the Executive have supported the non-introduction of water charges.  I also want to make it clear that I welcome the amendment proposed by the Ulster Unionist Party and will be supporting it, albeit I may make some remarks about it.</p><p>We are in election season.  There are ones out there at the moment who, for their own purposes, are making suggestions as to what they believe should happen in relation to this.  It is no secret that the Alliance Party has always strongly advocated the introduction of water charges.  That is something which, I am thankful, all the other parties in the Executive have avoided for some time and hopefully will do so for the foreseeable future.</p><p>If there were a situation where money was plentiful and the pockets of people in Northern Ireland were full, you could ask people to pay more.  Unfortunately, we are not in that situation in Northern Ireland and I do not see us being in such a situation for the foreseeable future.  It is now on record what such a charge would be.  We are all familiar with the fact that the charge would be, on average, just over &#163;400 per household.  The average rates bill per household is approximately &#163;800.  As a public representative, I am glad &#8212; and I keep saying that I am glad &#8212; that other Executive Ministers have supported the non-introduction of water charges.  I am certainly glad that that has been the commitment because, for many, it is a struggle to find what they have to pay without an additional burden being put on them.  The other thing that bothers me is that many depend on rate rebates and suchlike, which someone else picks up.  Ultimately, someone has to pay that cost, whether the individual has the money or not.</p><p>I think that the Alliance Party has been on record these last few days as trying to distance itself from some of its comments.  The reality is that a portion of the &#163;800 goes towards NI Water (NIW) through the DRD, but it is a very small portion; it falls short of &#163;400.  I think that the officials were on record last week or the week before, when they came to the Committee, as saying how much that charge would be.  To put a burden of an additional &#163;400 would, I think, be irresponsible of the Alliance Party.  I look forward to hearing what its Members say in their contributions.</p><p>I agree that there has maybe been a lack of investment in infrastructure.  I have been critical of the Minister since becoming the Chair of the Committee, but the Minister has to be commended for the work that NI Water has done in recent months to drive efficiencies in the organisation.  We cannot be complacent; just because it has found some efficiencies does not mean that there are not more to be found.  Given the work that has been done over the last number of months and the commitment that the chief executive has given, I trust that more efficiencies will be found in the organisation.  The direct correlation should be that, wherever efficiencies are found, more investment should go into infrastructure.  I definitely do not want to see us, as ratepayers, having to pay more.  That is how it has to be done.</p><p>I indicated that I will support the amendment.  The Minister has been supported, and he continues to be supported, by his Executive colleagues.  I remind him that he got the fourth best settlement in the Budget this year.  I know that he is finding it difficult in other areas, but, in that Budget, he was very generous towards NI Water.  However, it has been underfunded in the past, and, going forward, that may be the case again.  Efficiencies should be found in the Minister's Department, and I trust that he will do what he can to find those efficiencies to divert as much as possible to the underfunded water infrastructure, which we have been failing for many years.  The facts are there for what is required in infrastructure investment.  Not taking away from the Water Service, if you look at the same Minister's portfolio, I think that the officials are on record as saying that the investment in roads alone at the last count was &#163;830 million to bring our roads up to a reasonable standard.</p><p>I hope that, when the Alliance Party supports water charges, it will not be calling on central government to increase our vehicle road tax to increase the revenue that we can generate to fix our roads and bring them up to a reasonable standard.  The two things are on a par; we have hundreds of millions of pounds of underinvestment in both areas.  However, let us live in the real world:  we have an awful lot less money coming to Northern Ireland.  It is a difficult job to try to create a situation where that slice of cake is distributed round each of the various Departments and arm's-length bodies to carry out their role.  I commend my party colleague Arlene Foster for the number of jobs that she has brought to Northern Ireland, but we are still not in a situation where our pockets are full and there is money for people to spend, which would pull us out of the deficit that we have on underinvestment.</p><p>Underinvestment has not come since devolution here in Northern Ireland; it has been here since we were ruled by Westminster, so it has been a continual problem in Northern Ireland.  I certainly do not support the Alliance Party's call for the introduction of water charges now that we have devolved institutions here in Northern Ireland.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>I appreciate that answer.

There were a small number of responses, and we really need to make an effort to try to reach out as far as we can to get the public to engage.</p><p class=\"italic\">Question put and agreed to.\n\nResolved:</p><p class=\"italic\">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended until 16 October 2015, in relation to the Committee Stage of the Road Traffic (Speed Limits) Bill [NIA Bill 30/11-15].</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Road Traffic (Speed Limits) Bill: Extension of Committee Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>I beg to move</p><p class=\"italic\">That this Assembly approves the report of the Committee for Regional Development [NIA 168/11-16] on its inquiry into the benefits of cycling to the economy; and calls on the Minister for Regional Development, in conjunction with his Executive colleagues and other relevant bodies, to implement the recommendations contained in the report.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak &#8212; if I can and my voice holds out &#8212; to the House on this very important subject and on our report on the benefits of cycling to the economy.  This represents a significant body of work, and I would like at the outset to record my thanks to the many contributors to the report, including the members of the Committee; the members of the all-party group on cycling; external witnesses; and officials from the Department for Regional Development, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department of the Environment.  In particular, I would like to thank those from the Great Western Greenway and Chain Reaction Cycles for hosting the Committee on external study visits.  I also record the Committee's thanks to our own support team, Hansard and our Assembly researcher for their invaluable contributions.</p><p>H G Wells said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of the human race.\"</p><p>The Committee recently held an external meeting in Ballycraigy Primary School.  After that meeting, we had the opportunity to witness how the children were being introduced to cycling and how they were developing their cycling skills through the Active School Travel programme.  The Committee would like to thank the principal, teachers and children at Ballycraigy Primary School for the inspirational display that they provided to members on that cold, snowy morning.  The Committee therefore welcomes the fact that the Minister is continuing to support this valuable programme and hopes that this will continue for the long-term future, irrespective of the financial pressures that his Department might otherwise be facing.</p><p>It might be more apt, therefore, to say that every time we see a person, rather than just an adult, on a bike, we no longer despair for the future of the human race.  It is also very apt that the Department's draft strategy recognises that education, both of children and adults, is a key component in helping to make the transition from inactivity to activity, from the car to the bicycle and from non-cyclist to cyclist.  It is not the only action that is required, but it is nevertheless integral to helping both to change people's mindsets about cycling and to bring about the modal shift from vehicular forms of transport.</p><p>I would like to dwell a little bit longer on the draft strategy.  Firstly, I would like to thank the Minister and his officials within the very enthusiastic cycling unit for bringing forward the draft strategy.  Whilst the Committee might be seen to have been critical of its content, it is nevertheless a valiant attempt to bring cycling to the fore of our thinking.  It is, however, the Committee's view that it is more a statement of intent than a strategy.  This viewpoint has been endorsed by the Department, as recorded in Hansard.  Sustrans described the vision as being more of an aim than truly visionary.</p><p>This aim talks of culture, mutual respect, freedom and confidence as all being very aspirational, but, put in its most simplistic terms, cycling should be no more difficult than getting into a car or on a bus or train.  That is why the Committee has suggested a very ordinary vision; a vision of a Northern Ireland where people from all sectors of the community cycle for transport and enjoyment.  Cycling must become an ordinary, everyday event that is carried out by ordinary people, in ordinary clothes, as an ordinary form of transport.  If we accept this as our vision, we can begin to plan for all those other things that the Department aspires to in its statement of intent.</p><p>We can plan for an infrastructure that goes beyond the Belfast-centric aspirations of the statement.  With this will come the confidence for people to begin cycling and walking or to get back on bicycles.  Our culture of dependence on the car will begin to erode.  Communities will have the freedom to travel, and we will start to build the mutual respect that is needed by all road users.  By striding towards this simplified vision, we can journey towards a healthier population, connected and cohesive communities, and a more affordable, integrated, safe, responsive and sustainable transport system.</p><p>Those should be our targets because, unlike the Department, the Committee and many of the cycling fraternity believe that the strategy must have targets.  It is ridiculous and unacceptable that a Department has consciously chosen to set an arbitrary Northern Ireland-wide target for the percentage of people cycling, as we do not think that it would encourage people to use a bicycle at a local level.</p><p>Cambridge has just achieved 30% of all journeys being taken by means of cycling and walking, but has it consciously chosen to do away with targets?  No; it has instead increased its targets for people walking and cycling to 40%, which is higher than that in the Netherlands.  The Committee believes that objectives and targets are essential to provide clarity for the end vision, to drive the strategy and subsequent delivery plans forward and, very importantly, to make the Department accountable for the success of the strategy.  We have made recommendations about those in our report.  Additionally, the Department should not try to distort the measurement of success against the targets, as it has for rural provision.  When we asked the Department to identify cycle tracks and lanes on main roads in rural areas, we were given the Sydenham bypass, the A55 Parkway, the Holywood Road, the Saintfield Road and Belvoir Road as examples, because the Department uses the classification that some of those roads have been classed as rural roads and are subject to a speed limit of more than 40 mph, while our urban roads are subject to a limit of 40 mph and under.  Such distortions are unacceptable.</p><p>The Committee made a number of other recommendations that aim to strengthen the strategy, some of which will undoubtedly be touched on by other contributors to the debate.  I want to cover other contributions that cycling can make to our economy, tourism and the health sectors.  A recent UK report stated that some cycling schemes have a benefit:cost ratio of 35:1.  To put that into perspective, the &#163;43 billion HS2 proposal has a benefit:cost ratio of 2:3.  There is no definitive evidence about the value of cycling to the Northern Ireland economy.  The Committee heard evidence from Sustrans that, extrapolating figures from a London School of Economics study, the benefit of cycling to Northern Ireland could be in the region of &#163;89 million.  CTC, on the other hand, put that figure for Northern Ireland somewhere between &#163;300 million and &#163;400 million.</p><p>We can substantiate some contributions to the economy.  During the inquiry, the Committee conducted a site visit to Chain Reaction in Doagh, which is the world&#8217;s leading online cycling product retailer.  The company has approximately 500 employees and a turnover in excess of &#163;150 million.  Through employment, mail distribution, capital investment and taxes, Chain Reaction contributes around &#163;40 million to the Northern Ireland economy annually.  That is a consequence of having no targets.  The Committee believes that establishing a baseline that allows you to measure progress through the lifetime of a strategy is essential, and we recommend that accordingly.</p><p>Our friend H G Wells stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Cycle tracks will abound in Utopia\".</p><p>Unfortunately, the Committee fully recognises that there are limitations on the levels of investment, and many of the solutions that will most likely effect a significant change in cycle numbers must correlate to the nature and consistency of existing and future infrastructure.  That is why the Committee has called on the Department to be imaginative with its budget for cycling.  Cycling provision in Belfast is, for example, very piecemeal.  Indeed, the Committee, while visiting public hire taxi ranks in Belfast, noted a length of cycle track that went no more than 100 metres before disappearing in its entirety.</p><p>A strategic and well-planned cycling infrastructure is needed, and, whilst it might not be segregated by separate kerbs, for example, more cost-effective segregation should be considered.  Investment should not be Belfast-centric, and consideration should be given to investing in communities through, for example, funding an equivalent to Walking in your Community, which is being delivered by Outdoor Recreation and other such programmes and initiatives.</p><p>I will turn briefly to the impact of cycling on tourism.  The success of the Giro d&#8217;Italia and the follow-up, with the staging of the Gran Fondo in June, have been major contributors to the impetus for cycling and cycling products in Northern Ireland.  That has been recognised by the managing director of Chain Reaction, who stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;From our perspective as a business, it would be great to see an increased level of investment in facilities and infrastructure here in Northern Ireland because that would help to support the growth of cycling globally and tourism coming into the area&#8221;.</p><p>It is disappointing, therefore, that NITB, or Tourism Northern Ireland as it is now, has not followed up on those successes through the publication of its much-heralded, but unseen, legacy report.  The impetus that I have referred to must not be allowed to diminish but built upon to promote Northern Ireland as a cycling tourism venue as part of the EuroVelo cycling package.  That does not require significant levels of investment, as the Committee witnessed at first hand in Mulranny, County Mayo, when it visited the Great Western Greenway.  That 42 kilometres of disused railway line between Westport and Achill Island cost little more than &#8364;5&#183;6 million.  It has contributed to and maintains 65 new jobs, has in excess of 210,000 users each year and, in 2010, was estimated to be contributing over &#8364;7 million to the local economy.  That is a significant return on a reasonably insignificant investment.</p><p>The Committee noted the progress that has been made in developing over 450 kilometres of off-road trails in Northern Ireland over recent years, including the international mountain bike trails in Davagh forest, just outside Cookstown in County Tyrone, and Rostrevor and Castlewellan in County Down, which attracted up to 82,000 visitors in the first year of operation.  Figures from Scotland show that such trails can generate 1&#183;3 million visitors per annum for mountain biking alone, which is equivalent to about 300,000 bed nights.  In 2009, it was predicted that the economic value of mountain biking in Scotland would rise from &#163;119 million to &#163;155 million.</p><p>The Assembly research paper on cycling for leisure, recreation and tourism detailed the benefits of cycling tourism.  Cycle tourism can provide incentives for people to visit an area and help to attract new types of visitors who can stay longer and spend more in a particular destination.  It can also support existing local trade, particularly in the hospitality sector, and offer business start-up opportunities, such as bike hire, particularly in rural areas.  It is an environmentally sustainable form of tourism, with minimal impact on the environment, and it can help reduce traffic congestion.  It also utilises existing and often underused facilities such as quiet laneways, canal towpaths and disused railway lines.  Ultimately, those who participate in cycling, while on holiday or as a leisure activity, may be encouraged to cycle more frequently, other than for utility  purposes  The Committee has recommended, therefore, as a matter of urgency, that Tourism Northern Ireland, in conjunction with relevant Executive Departments, develops a cycling tourism package for Northern Ireland.</p><p>Finally, Mr Principal Deputy Speaker, the Committee has received substantial evidence about the positive impact that cycling could have in respect of tackling obesity.  Evidence from the Chief Medical Officer stated that just 53% of adults meet the current physical activity guidelines, whilst research shows that children in Northern Ireland are the least physically active anywhere in the United Kingdom, with 50% of seven-year-olds here not getting the recommended one hour of physical activity each day.</p><p>Those statistics support the fact that physical activity is number four in the global causes of mortality.  Whilst the Committee believes that it is erroneous to claim that cycling is a cure for obesity, it is, if properly targeted, a powerful tool to encourage physical activity.  That is one of the reasons why the Committee is so supportive of the Active School Travel programme and other initiatives and events in the likes of our forest parks.  Those venues offer a degree of safety and segregation for cyclists and walkers, and all efforts should be made to open up other venues.  In addition, the Committee believes that future road capital infrastructure investments should be health proofed.</p><p>Mr Principal Deputy Speaker, the Committee is content that the potential for significant contributions to the economy through cycling can be achievable.  The impacts of cycling transport can be environmental, social and economic, and the benefits of promoting cycling occur in society as a whole, as well as on an individual level.  I look forward to hearing the remaining contributions from Members and, in particular, the Minister.  On behalf of the Committee for Regional Development, I commend our report to the House.  Thank you very much.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Cycling: Benefits to the Economy"}], "title": "", "house": "3", "image": "/images/mpsL/13897.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2011-05-09 13:07:07", "image_width": 82, "person_id": "13897", "entered_reason": "election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Trevor Clarke", "member_id": "90389", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "DUP", "constituency": "South Antrim"}, {"left_reason": "dissolution", "first_name": "Trevor", "last_name": "Clarke", "left_house": "2011-03-24", "title": "", "house": "3", "image": "/images/mpsL/13897.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2011-03-28 17:40:16", "image_width": 82, "person_id": "13897", "entered_reason": "election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Trevor Clarke", "member_id": "90264", "entered_house": "2007-03-09", "party": "DUP", "constituency": "South Antrim"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Judith", "last_name": "Cochrane", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>As a member of the Finance and Personnel Committee, I rise to comment on our report into sickness absence in the Northern Ireland public sector.  I apologise for being late to the debate.  It is perhaps somewhat ironic that my reason for being late was due to me trying to juggle the responsibilities as an employer dealing with somebody who is on long-term sick absence, which is impacting massively on a number of other things.</p><p>From what I have heard, the main points have been covered by other Members, and I concur with most of what has been said.  At the outset, it is worth noting that absence due to ill health has huge adverse effects on individuals, businesses, the public sector and, consequently, the economy as a whole.  It is an area of policy where the UK is falling behind other countries, and, indeed, the Northern Ireland public sector is performing particularly poorly.  Although this report was specifically looking at the absence levels in the public sector, it is widely acknowledged that the percentage of hours lost to sickness in the public sector has continuously been higher than that of the private sector.  Therefore, the Committee considered what the absence patterns were like in the private sector and whether any lessons could be learned or best practice shared across both sectors.</p><p>There are, however, a number of factors to consider when interpreting the differences between the public and private sectors such as the fact that there are differences in the types of jobs between the two sectors and that some job profiles or work patterns have higher likelihoods of sickness than others.</p><p>Another issue to consider is that, on average, women have more sickness absence than men.  The public sector employs a higher proportion of female workers and, therefore, figures could be slightly skewed.  Individuals in the private sector are more likely not to be paid for a spell of sickness than those in the public sector.  That may mean that private sector workers are more likely to go to work when they are sick.  Absence levels also tend to increase with an organisation's size, regardless of sector.  Most of our public-sector organisations dwarf our business sector in Northern Ireland, so that could be one of the reasons why there are such big differences.</p><p>We should not be disheartened.  Our report recognises that the Civil Service has good policies in place to address absence and that new health and well-being initiatives are being rolled out.  That may be the reason why over 55% of employees have no sick absence at all, and that good news should be celebrated.  It is the other 45% that needs to be addressed to reduce the burden of the &#163;30 million cost associated with sick absence.</p><p>The report recognised an increase in stress and mental health problems among employees.  We need to ask why that is the case.  Is it the result of more work pressure, which could be exacerbated with continued public-sector reform?  Is it simply that nowadays staff are struggling to cope with their caring responsibilities outside work?  Most families now need two incomes, which results in much more pressure on juggling priorities at home.  We therefore need to look more at what workplace flexibility is offered to see whether it can help to reduce absence.</p><p>The report highlights the importance of the effective use of the return-to-work interview process.  Making adjustments early on really helps to iron out some issues and can prevent the long-term absences that we often see.  The report also referred to early interventions, such as referral to physiotherapists or cognitive behavioural therapy.  These are recommended as a way to reduce the likelihood of small absences becoming larger.</p><p>We have an ageing population, which means that people are working longer, but it also means that there is likely to be a greater prevalence of chronic illness, which is likely to affect those in work and those with caring responsibilities.  We need to continue to come up with innovative ways to address the changing needs of the workforce.  It is normal for the work environment to change as people's careers progress, and that may entail physical changes to the work environment as well as changes to the terms and conditions of employment.  Introducing more flexible working, where we can, can be key to supporting employees' health and well-being as they get older.  Other important measures include skills analyses, job design and coaching and mentoring to make sure that people are in the right job, which is also essential for good mental health.</p><p>In conclusion, workplace absenteeism is costly and, if not addressed, it will restrain our public sector from delivering services to their full potential.  Reducing sickness absence is a must, and the report highlights a number of effective strategies that are worth pursuing.  I commend the report to the House.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Sickness Absence in the Northern Ireland Public Sector"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>First, the Alliance Party concurs with the signatories to the motion that the cuts to the Northern Ireland block grant have caused major problems for Northern Ireland, but we should be clear that Northern Ireland is not the only region of the UK being adversely affected by cuts.  We are, however, also facing other pressures, and Northern Ireland is likely to end up in a serious financial crisis as a result.  We face not only large spending cuts but looming Budget uncertainty due to penalties as a result of the as yet unresolved issue of welfare reform.  We also have the added future funding pressure of resourcing a lower level of corporation tax, which includes replacing the lost revenue to HM Treasury and investing more in skills and infrastructure.  We welcome the devolution of corporation tax but recognise that we need to have a sound strategy in place to deal with the funding pressure in order to allow us to realise the future benefits.</p><p>The motion refers to proposed further cuts over the next mandate and:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"declares its opposition to the austerity policies at the root of all of this\".</p><p>Again, we concur with the thrust of that in that the specific austerity policies of the UK Government are being forced too quickly upon us, with little balance of policies to stimulate the economy.  In Alliance's 2010 manifesto, we recognised the need for the UK Government to address the deficit, but we also cautioned about the rate at which that would be done.  Our advice has been borne out in events.</p><p>We have seen too steep a decline in public spending across the UK, and that has probably slowed our economic recovery.  We  continue to caution against addressing the deficit at too fast a rate in the next Government.  Continued deep cuts in public spending will have huge implications for the Northern Ireland block grant and public services and economic investments here.</p><p>Instead of pleading a special case for Northern Ireland, we should be arguing for a slowdown in the rate of austerity at a UK level.  That would be more likely to have a greater positive impact on the Northern Ireland block grant.  A slowdown in the rate of austerity could, itself, constitute an economic stimulus, especially if what would otherwise have been cut from public spending at a UK level was redirected into economically relevant areas.</p><p>It is worth noting that the UK economic recovery is being seen largely in terms of the fall in unemployment and a record employment level.  However, there has not really been any increase in productivity.  Indeed, UK productivity levels are poor by OECD standards.  That is because a lot of low-paid and unskilled jobs are being created to produce the current employment levels, but it is not healthy.  That is something that the Executive and the next UK Government need to address.</p><p>The motion:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"calls on the Executive to continue to defend the core public services of health and education\".</p><p>Again, Alliance acknowledges the importance of health and education as key public services, but we would add policing and economic growth intervention such as skills development.  We would caution against simply doing any read across of any protection given to health and education in English public spending decisions and doing the same in Northern Ireland.  We have a very different context here.  While there is a case for some degree of protection of the health and education budgets, there is significant scope for reform.  We need to be careful not to simply continue to allocate resources to a sector that is under pressure without expecting it to pursue its efficiency agenda.</p><p>That is particularly clear in education, where we are diverting almost &#163;300 million per year to resource a largely segregated education system.  Of course, that is not the only area that is costing us more to run due to our failure to address division in Northern Ireland.</p><p>If we are to lobby the UK Government effectively on any changes to the block grant, we must learn the clear lesson from the botched initial attempts to make a pitch in the Stormont House process.  Making a loose, general pitch for more resources for general public spending, especially in the context of parts of GB having deep socio-economic problems, is pointless.  We need to base any pitch on the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, show that we are genuinely trying to tackle the cost of division and not being reckless with public funds, and link any additional resources to specific deliverables.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>T4.

Members will be aware that the Financial Assistance for Political Parties Act (Northern Ireland) 2000 provides for payments to political parties for the purpose of assisting Members to perform their duties.  It does not provide payments to individual Members.</p><p>It is proposed that the revised financial assistance to political parties scheme &#8212; known as the FAPP scheme &#8212; will reduce payments to the parties by 3%, as part of a package of measures to meet the overall reduction in the Assembly Commission's budget for 2015-16.  The Assembly Commission undertook a full review of the FAPP scheme in 2012, following recommendations highlighted by our internal audit service and raised by the Northern Ireland Audit Office.  A revised scheme that provided for a range of enhanced governance and administrative controls was agreed by the Assembly in March 2013.  No substantive change to the amounts payable under the scheme was made at that time and indeed the last uprating of amounts payable was in 2008.</p><p>Changes agreed during that process included that parties that employed and funded staff from the assistance provided through the FAPP scheme must use the Assembly's payroll processes in the administration of those payments.  It is also now a condition that all payments will be made only on receipt of supporting documentation in the same way as office cost expenditure payments are made, and that all claims are published in line with publication of Members' expenditure.  Furthermore, an independent audit of FAPP expenditure and claims is undertaken at the end of each financial year.</p><p>The Assembly Commission's budget for 2015-16 has been reduced by 5%, which amounts to 8% of the costs directly controllable by the Commission.  To deal with that budget and anticipated cuts, the Commission initiated a strategic and financial planning programme known as SP15+ &#8212; strategic planning 2015 and beyond &#8212; to prioritise the allocation of resources and to identify any budget reductions.  At its meeting on 18 March 2015, the Assembly Commission agreed measures to achieve a balanced budget for 2015-16, including reducing FAPP by 3%.</p><p>There were different views amongst Commission members as to what reduction should be proposed.  A range of issues was raised, including that a cut in FAPP would most probably lead to redundancies amongst support staff, who are already lower paid and have less favourable terms of employment than staff employed directly by the Assembly Commission.  Those staff would also be unable to avail themselves of the generous voluntary exit scheme in place for other public-sector employees.</p><p>The majority agreement of the Commission, therefore, was to propose a 3% cut.  However, to work towards balancing the Commission's budget, I did propose, and other members agreed, a separate reduction in the childcare scheme, which would have placed the burden of cuts directly on Members themselves.  In its wisdom, the independent financial review panel vetoed that option, and did so with no consultation whatsoever with the Members who would be affected by the proposal.  Instead, it proposed an equivalent cut, which will directly impact on constituency services rather than on Members.</p><p>The revised amounts payable under the FAPP scheme as proposed today will assist in meeting the budget reductions required by the Assembly Commission and ensure that the impact of the wider public-sector expenditure climate is seen to be shared by all parts of the public sector.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Assembly Business: Financial Assistance for Political Parties Scheme 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-16", "body": "<p>With your permission, Mr Principal Deputy Speaker, I propose to answer questions 2, 3, 6 and 8 together.  Perhaps you will indulge me if I go over my two minutes.</p><p>The Assembly Commission&#8217;s budget covers a range of different expenditure categories, including Members' salaries and allowances, Assembly secretariat staffing costs and general administration costs.  As a result of the overall Budget agreement, the Commission's total budget for 2015-16 was reduced by 5%, equating to a cut of just over &#163;2 million.  Approximately 40% of the Commission's total budget of &#163;40&#183;7 million relates to costs that are set by the Independent Financial Review Panel and, therefore, lies outside the control of the Commission.  That means that the overall reduction of &#163;2 million becomes a bigger challenge, as the Commission has discretion over only approximately &#163;24 million of its budget.  A cut of that scale will undoubtedly have an impact on the services and activities that the Commission delivers.</p><p>To deliver those savings in 2015-16 and to continue to absorb any upward inflationary pressures, the Commission recognises that a significant reconfiguration of the way that services are provided is required.  To that end, a strategic planning initiative was commissioned for 2015-16 and beyond.  The initiative has already carried out a detailed review of all the activities that the Assembly secretariat delivers and has prioritised those activities into the three broad categories of statutory, essential and important.</p><p>At its meeting on 10 March 2015, the Commission agreed a package of measures to deliver the &#163;2 million savings that are required in the next financial year.  Those measures include the approximate &#163;220,000 saving from the further reduction of office costs expenditure for Members as stipulated by the Independent Financial Review Panel (IFRP); reductions in payments to political parties under the financial assistance for political parties (FAPP) scheme; savings in staffing costs through reductions in temporary staffing numbers and, hopefully, through participation in the public-sector voluntary exit scheme; and savings through a wholesale reduction in administrative costs.

That could yield approximately another &#163;60,000 of savings.

However, the current situation is that, as soon as you are 60, you get a free bus pass.

Our view is that revenue that is raised from those who can afford it should be spent on public services and job creation.</p><p>Finally, I will comment on the amendment proposed by the DUP.  The Alliance Party has always been a supporter of greater fiscal devolution because it has the potential to increase the efficiency and responsiveness of the Government.  Our motive for greater fiscal devolution is to ensure that we have the tools to deliver our policy aims.  Our priority should be to seek the devolution of any powers where there is expected to be a clear benefit for the people of Northern Ireland.  For example, we supported the devolution of air passenger duty (APD) on direct long-haul flights as a means of lowering the tax for flights into Northern Ireland, but we take a slightly different approach to short-haul APD powers, as the cost could be in the region of &#163;60 million to &#163;90 million per annum.</p><p>While there is nothing essentially wrong with the proposed amendment from the DUP, it really only summarises ongoing work.  I therefore urge Members to support the Alliance amendment instead, which seeks to ensure that the Executive, collectively, live up to the challenges of the Stormont House Agreement and guarantee that all Departments, not just one or two, reduce wasteful spending by reconfiguring service delivery in a manner consistent with the shared future.</p><p>At the end of the day, the Executive's Budget, unlike those of other Governments, remains largely unrelated to the success of our economic policy, and we face no financial penalty for failing to create a shared future and stimulate our economy fully.  We may not be held to account each year through our tax take, but we are accountable for tax waste, and we owe it to the people of Northern Ireland to address that and feed those savings into better public services for all.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant: Reductions"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>I beg to move amendment No 1:</p><p class=\"italic\">Leave out all after \"front-line services\"; and insert:\n\n\"further recognises that the Executive have additional revenue-generating powers that have not been explored fully as part of the Budget process; recognises that there has not been a consistent approach to reducing waste and pursuing public-sector reform to ensure that additional resources are available for front-line services; and calls on the Executive to identify, collectively, progressive options to raise local revenue, tackle waste and pursue public-service reform to effectively increase the local Budget.\".</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue today and to have moved the Alliance Party amendment.  First, we should be clear that Northern Ireland is not the only region being adversely affected by cuts.  The reality is that the pressure on public finances will increase in coming years.  We therefore need to have a sound strategy in place to ensure that we can continue to deliver our front-line services.</p><p>It is widely recognised that fiscal contractions are best addressed using a ratio of spending cuts:revenue-raising.  However, the 2015-16 Budget was predicated on a cuts-only basis.  The substantive motion today essentially acknowledges what the Alliance Party has said previously, in that there is a need for some revenue-raising.  It also reiterates a key recommendation from the Committee for Finance and Personnel's report on the draft Budget; namely, calling on the Executive:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to prepare and publish a consultation paper on the options across all departments for raising additional revenue\",</p><p>setting out all the benefits, risks and impacts on the economy, consumers and the most vulnerable.</p><p>The Alliance Party, however, does not believe that that should be done in isolation.  Fair revenue-raising structures must go hand in hand with other reforms.  That is why we seek to amend the motion.  If we are going to take additional money off people, they have a right to know that that money is being well spent.  With no real attempt being made to address the cost of division or to make our public services more efficient, that would be unfair on those whose money we are seeking.  Furthermore, the overall amounts of money raised through most revenue-raising options would be trivial, so we must also review expenditure and be open to new ways of delivering our services to tackle waste.</p><p>The current scale of expenditure on education and health is so great that we need urgent strategies to manage the costs.  I have already asked OFMDFM whether it will consider reallocating the resources associated with the junior ministerial posts in its Department to posts in, for example, the Department of Health, which would allow a much greater focus to be given to that Department's important task, but the idea has been rejected.  The fact remains that, although there is a case for some degree of protection for the health and education budgets, there is significant scope for reform.  There needs to be greater transparency so that the Assembly can determine whether a consistent approach to prioritising service delivery is being taken across every Department.  We need to be careful not to continue simply to allocate resources to a sector that is under pressure without expecting it to pursue its efficiency agenda properly.</p><p>We do not need to start from scratch, as some useful work has already been undertaken.  For example, in health, the McKinsey and Appleby reports and the Compton review have set out areas for improvement, but serious political commitment is required if we are to take those forward.</p><p>Likewise, the Alliance Party believes that a serious commitment to promoting integration in the education system would produce significant financial savings.  That commitment would include addressing the cost of maintaining 70,000 empty school places and enabling funding to be directed to pupils rather than to sustaining a divided estate.</p><p>The challenge of reform, of course, is not limited to the Health Department and the Department of Education.  It is very clear that the deteriorating resource DEL position will necessitate proactive measures across all Departments to reduce the size of the public-sector pay bill.  Figures over previous years have shown that the pay bill has continued to increase over and above inflation, despite the so-called pay freeze, and, if the system can absorb &#163;30 million of sick pay without a noticeable reduction in output, there are clearly efficiencies to be made.  Every Department should be constantly challenging how things are done to ensure that services are being delivered in the most cost-effective manner.</p><p>The proposed voluntary exit scheme is designed to reduce the number of civil servants, but if we are admitting that we have more staff than we need, we also need to consider an approach that will remove the least effective workers rather than simply the oldest.  On the other hand, if many of the jobs are critical, other options will need to be explored, such as, for example, four-day weeks, pay cuts for the top earners, removing incremental rises for no extra work output etc.  Those may be controversial but, to deliver front-line services on a more sustainable footing, they need to be considered.</p><p>Alliance has long advocated that the Executive must tackle division and sectarianism in Northern Ireland, not just because of our strong support for promoting integration and a shared future but because we know that a divided society costs more to run.  That was recognised in the 'Together: Building a United Community' document, and the recent Stormont House Agreement stated that there should be an:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"audit of departmental spending to identify how divisions in society impact on the delivery of ... services, and to then consider how best to reconfigure service delivery in a manner consistent with a shared future.\"</p><p>That commitment must be progressed.  We simply cannot ask people to contribute additional revenue to the Executive if it is being allocated to public services that are sustaining a divided society or are not operating efficiently.  It is a major challenge, but it is one that the people of Northern Ireland expect our Executive to deliver on.</p><p>What are the Alliance proposals for revenue raising?  It is not the first time that I have spoken on these matters in the Chamber, and I am sure that it will not be the last time that the Minister will seek to misrepresent what I say.  First, to date, there has been no attempt to reduce spending on subsidies that disproportionately affect wealthier people.  We believe that those inappropriate subsidies should not be a priority for public expenditure and that they divert resources away from public services that assist the vulnerable.  The subsidies that we believe can be redirected into other services are, for example, free prescriptions for those who can afford it.  We need to return to a system where prescription charges are levied from people who can afford it, though with a wide range of exemptions, and we have already seen the DUP make a move to our way of thinking on that.</p><p>The removal of the rates subsidy on houses worth more than &#163;400,000 could raise about &#163;4 million a year, and Sinn F&#233;in is now following our lead on that as well.  Taking such decisions would be a first step in demonstrating that the Executive are serious about tackling such subsidies for the wealthy to protect services that benefit the less wealthy.</p><p>Alliance also believes that, in the longer term, some further forms of fair revenue raising are likely to be necessary.  That may be through domestic charges, either rates or water, but the key point is that any such measures should be fair, with adequate planning to ensure that they are implemented in a gradual manner.  In the case of water charging, for example, there would be a reduction in rates in the first year so that people are not paying twice for a service.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant: Reductions"}, {"date": "2015-02-16", "body": "<p>1.

There will be young people there with Union flags tied round their waists &#8212; they are young.&#160; There will be alcohol consumed on the streets from blue bags.&#160; All the ingredients are there in preparation for the first stone.&#160; They do it because they do not know what it is about.&#160; They do not know the magnitude of what took place over 100 years ago in France, yet an aberration of history drives them to express themselves in ways that will cause them no good.&#160;

It reminds me that it is an issue that has been around for a long time.  In fact, the fuel laundering that is going on around the border areas very much reminds me of what used to happen in the 17th and 18th centuries in the south of England around the smuggling of brandy and other illicit liquor.  It is endemic in the culture of those areas.  We have to be honest with ourselves:  it has been rooted in the Troubles, where the IRA and other illegal organisations used it as something to fund and fuel &#8212; pardon the pun &#8212; their organisations throughout the Troubles, and that has continued.  The real crime today is that we find that it is fuelling organised crime, and there are definitely organised criminals who are taking advantage of the situation in those border areas.  It is very lucrative for them.  We have seen the figures.  Millions of pounds are being lost in revenue every single year.</p><p>The level of detail they go into in those fuel laundering plants is absolutely frightening.  Not only are they set up as mini factories producing the illegal fuel, but escape routes are planned, there are tunnels and there are even lookouts in the surrounding area to give forewarning of anybody coming to raid the facilities.</p><p>We are looking at something that is done on an industrial scale.  If it is done on that scale, that leads to a lot of questions.  There are certainly a lot of questions in my mind.  How come the Government cannot get a grip of this issue?  Is there a lack of focus on it?</p><p>In fairness to the Minister of Justice, it is not only his Department that has responsibility for this; HMRC has a huge responsibility for it.  We heard how it has upped the ante on this in the past couple of years and has successfully closed down more plants.  However, there needs to be greater focus on what is going on.  This is organised crime at its worst.  Where is the money going?  Who is lining their pockets out of this?  What are they doing with it?  They are building up criminal empires.</p><p>That leads on to another issue.  Others in the House sat on their hands on the NCA.  I welcome that they have now got on board, because we need to get to grips with the criminals who are profiteering from this fuel laundering, the illegal dumping and all the other illegal matters occurring around our border in Northern Ireland.  Those people need to be closed down, and the way that that will be done effectively is by grabbing their assets.  Once you clean up and remove the profits that those criminals are making, you will have killed off the organisation behind them.  That is what we need to have in operation today, and, thankfully, it is now in operation.  I welcome that.</p><p>The other thought that occurred to me is that we are continually seeing these plants being set up.  I think that there are two factors in that.  There is a fear factor around the border, because organised criminal gangs are carrying this out.  I also believe that those who own properties around the border are afraid to pass information on to the police.  That cycle of fear needs to be broken.  Others with more influence in those border areas need to make it very clear to people on the ground that they should pass information about where this is going on to local police through whatever means necessary and on to HMRC.  If they do not, that cycle will continue.</p><p>There is also the thought and fear in my mind that some of those who rent these properties are profiteering.  That is for the police and HMRC to investigate.  I find the low level of arrests on this issue very disappointing.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I commend the motion to the House.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>Thank you, Minister.

It is at the root of what is being discussed.  Is it discrimination or not?  To be honest with you, from my personal background, I have absolutely no idea what it is.  I come from a deeply evangelical Protestant background, and I have no idea what it is all about.  However, I listened to and questioned the CCMS representatives with deep interest when they came to the Committee.  In some respects, Father Tim Bartlett let the cat out of the bag when he said that it is very much about not only teaching the sacraments of the Church but turning each maintained teacher into a religious education teacher.</p><p>If you go into a maintained school, not only are you a teacher of maths, English, physics or whatever but you are a religious instructor.  The difference is that you are a religious instructor of one religious viewpoint.  From an equality point of view, is that acceptable?  Everyone in the House has to make up their own mind on that.  My great difficulty is the fact that the state pays for this.  I would have thought that that is the role of the Church.</p><p>I see a completely different set-up in the controlled sector.  The Protestant Churches' viewpoint is not rammed down people's throats by every single teacher in that sector.  Only those who wish to teach religion do so.  Even when they teach religion, they follow the Northern Ireland curriculum, not the viewpoint of one single Church.</p><p>Does this discriminate against those who disagree with it or who disagree with the Roman Catholic faith?  I can come to only one conclusion:  in some respects, it does discriminate because, even if I can get a certificate that allows me to teach the Roman Catholic faith, I have no wish or desire to do so.  Am I being discriminated against?  I have come to my own conclusion, and the answer, in my mind, is yes.</p><p>Will this have a negative impact on our shared education future, to which everyone on the Committee, basically, agreed to?  It could have a negative impact, but the presentation made by both Brookeborough primary schools is reassuring for everyone in the House because those schools are already working together on a shared future.  I asked this question:  \"Are you having shared classes in those schools at present?\"  The answer was a very clear yes.  So, I asked the obvious question when I said, \"I take it those shared classes can only be taken by teachers who have the Catholic certificate\".  The blunt, fundamental answer from both principals was no.  So, those two schools have, in their own way, come to a solution that allows those without the Catholic certificate to teach subjects to shared classes in that school environment.  If that is the way forward for shared education, so be it.  I for one will back that situation.</p><p>When the transferors were in front of the Committee, I asked them the question about the Catholic certificate.  They made it very, very clear that there were ongoing negotiations between the four main Churches around the issue so that a solution agreed by all the Churches could be found.  In some respects, that is maybe the best way forward.  However, as far as this goes here today, I have to support the motion, because no matter what I think, I see an element of discrimination in the Catholic certificate which I, as an evangelical Protestant, cannot support.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Teacher Employment: Inequality"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>4.

I look at the figures and see a 67% rise in autism alone in the past few years, so I think that no one here argues against the idea that the provision for special educational needs in our education system needs to be looked at or overhauled.</p><p>I welcome the Member who spoke previously into the digital age.  It is good to see that he has got there, and I understand his wish to see all this legislation completely rewritten and embedded.  However, that is something for the Department to look at.</p><p>There are quite a few things in the proposed Bill that have some merit.  Clause 1 places a new duty on the Education Authority to have regard to the views of the child in relation to decisions being taken for them.  That is something which, we almost think, states the obvious but, time and again, has been overlooked in existing legislation, where the views of parents and educational specialists were paramount and the child, to a large extent, was left out of the discussion that was taking place about them.  I welcome the fact that the child's views will now be taken on board.</p><p>Clause 3 extends the existing duties of boards of governors in relation to SEN.  That is something that I warmly welcome.  I welcome the fact that there will be a pupil profile built in there and that we will have the learning support coordinators built in, not only to our education system but for the board of governors.  It is long overdue that we recognise that governors have a good insight into how those with special educational needs are dealt with in the schools.  How do they get someone to aid them?  What is that provision supposed to be?  How does that work out from day to day in the classroom?  More importantly, is it seeing an improvement in learning on the part of the individual in question?  Because, at the end of the day, that is what the school is supposed to be about:  educating our children, even those with special educational needs.  That is a welcome step forward.</p><p>Clause 5 changes from 29 to 22 the number of days that we have to get supporting information.  Like the Chair of the Committee, I understand why that is there:  it is to reduce the time it takes to get a statement.  I have come up against this in dealing with and supporting individuals with their cases.  However, my only word of caution is that other outside information sometimes takes longer to get coordinated.  Will that exclude some outside information from the likes of health or whatever that does not come in on time or will allowances be made for that in the system?  I hope that the Minister will think about that to see how it will work out.</p><p>I welcome clause 8, which makes provision for the establishment of an independent mediation service.  That is long overdue.  A lot of mediation was probably done by many Members and by many outside bodies.  It is good to see that formalised in the Bill.</p><p>Clause 9 gives to those over compulsory school age the right to appeal and to make statutory assessments.  That is a fascinating one because there are two aspects to it.  Children with special educational needs who go into mainstream education are clearly deemed to be competent to do so.  If they are over the normal school age, that is quite right.  It is absolutely right that they have a huge say in their own special educational needs treatment.  Sadly, when you move into other aspects of educational needs, that does not necessarily follow through.  I will watch that with great interest.</p><p>The thrust of the Bill is to speed up how we deal with special educational needs and get statements put on children.  That is to be welcomed.  The word of caution in all this in my own mind was mentioned by the Chair of the Committee:  that this Bill needs a lot of transitional arrangements.  It needs subordinate legislation underneath it all.</p><p>The role and duty of the Committee is to scrutinise the impact that a Bill is physically going to have on the ground.  There is a need for us to have sight of the subordinate legislation so that we can understand what its impact will be.  Otherwise, the job of the Committee will be made incredibly difficult.  I appeal to the Minister to give the Committee insight into that area if he can because that is where the in-depth scrutiny takes place, not in the Chamber.</p><p>All this legislation may well help us in how we treat those with special educational needs in the education system.  It may well put all the structures into place, and we may well pat ourselves on the back and think that we have done something great.  One thing that I have discovered in all legislation is that implementation is critical; how it is carried out in a school or classroom is where it counts.  We may well get all the building blocks in the right place, but the wall itself might collapse because of how the legislation is implemented.</p><p>Whatever the impact of these changes, there is a job of education to be done with regard to those who will have to carry this out, whether boards of governors, teachers or special needs assistants.  All need to understand how this is meant to help the child.  Like many Members, I have seen some appalling examples of how statements are carried out.  One child in my locality fought for years to get a statement.  They got one, and it was inevitable that they would because they have limited sight and are registered blind.  Despite having a classroom assistant to aid their education and despite all the statement being put in place, where was the first place that child was put in the classroom?  The very back seat, so they could not see what was on the interactive board.  Common sense has a large role to play.  While we may pass the legislation and try to improve the system, the training of those who have to fulfil this will be critical.  With that, I will sit down.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-17", "body": "<p>Will the Minister give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Dromore Central Primary School"}, {"date": "2015-02-17", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for reminding us of the Dromore High School situation.

Its use would inevitably lead to growth in the youth population. \n<BR/>I want to clarify something with the Minister.  I am doing the sums only in my head, but I think that the first year intake will have class sizes of roughly 25, 26 or 27 &#8212; you simply divide it by four.  Is the Minister advocating that that drop to three, meaning that we could be looking at class sizes of 35?  Is that the future of primary-school education in Northern Ireland?

Like my colleague Trevor Lunn, this is not the first time that I have come across this issue.  St Colman's was a prime example of where that seemed to have occurred.  This is part of the difficulty with predicting movements in population.  I think that we all know that a reasonably straightforward way of predicting population trends is to follow the birth rate etc in different geographical areas.  What we cannot predict, because we live in a democracy and people have the right to move to whatever area they choose, is changes in the demographics as the children grow up.  This is part of the difficulty that we are seeing in Dromore.</p><p>I spoke to the chief executive of the Southern Board.  Its prediction was that the birth rate in the Dromore area would go down.  When I checked with the preschools &#8212; they all have their intake figures for this year &#8212; they are well and truly oversubscribed this year, as they were last year and the previous year.  That tends to indicate that, despite the actual figures that the Department holds around birth rates in the locality, we are seeing a general population movement into Dromore.</p><p>I hate to say this, but some of the figures that this is based on may not be entirely accurate.  There is plenty of anecdotal evidence in Dromore to suggest that that may well be the case.  There is still housing growth in the Dromore area.  It is bucking the trend, in many ways, with regard to what we see in housing elsewhere.  It is a good area to live in.  It is close to the A1.  It is predominantly a commuter town.  There is a projected growth in housing of almost 300 or 400 new homes to be built in the Dromore area over the next few years.  There is a change in the demographics, with people and their children moving into the Dromore area.  That is where the figures are getting skewed, because what the board is telling me, what the Department is saying and, ultimately, what I am seeing in reality on the ground does not match up.  I appeal to the Minister to look at that and to verify with the preschools that there is that growth in the population in the area.  That is the best trigger of all with regard to not only the primary school in Dromore but primary schools around it.  In my experience, they are all full.  That is the difficulty that I have with the decision.  If they are all full, where do those children go?</p><p>Trevor and I were invited to the opening of the new St Colman's school because both of us helped to get that new school developed.  It was not the Minister who opened it; it was the deputy First Minister.  I am sure that the Minister will be amused to hear that we were all regaled in Irish for quite a bit of the opening ceremony.  I have to be honest:  I did not understand it, but it was nice to hear it.  That said, while I sat through that ceremony for that new school opening, it was not lost on me that the school had had to convert its library and another room to accommodate the children who were already at the school.  That was an opportunity lost for us to get it right with regard to a new build.</p><p>Unfortunately, Minister, whatever is going on with the system that we use to predict numbers in geographical areas, I do not know whether it takes into account parental choice, but I see that being repeated in Dromore.  I appeal to the Minister to go to the preschools, verify those figures and see whether there is a case, even at this late stage, for making economic sense by adding a few additional classrooms onto a build that is already under way.

As some Members have already pointed out, policing in Northern Ireland is under huge budgetary and resource pressures.  At present, we are supposed, allegedly, to have 7,000 police officers in Northern Ireland.  The simple truth is that the current figure falls 300 short of that.  Recruitment is under way to rectify that situation, if possible and if finances allow.  There is a huge question mark over that.

They are clearly exploiting the loophole here at present.  That is something that, hopefully, the House will rectify today.</p><p>I also want to speak on the need for accountability for the National Crime Agency in Northern Ireland.  That issue was raised not only by our colleagues on the other side of the House but by us, and, more importantly, it was also raised by the Chief Constable.  Even he could not figure out how, under any circumstances, two law enforcement agencies could act in the one jurisdiction and serious incidents not occur.  He has argued from the very start that accountability for the NCA and its operations in Northern Ireland should go through the office of the Chief Constable.  The order clearly indicates that that is the case and will be the case.  Under those circumstances, it is very simple for me to support the measures proposed here today.</p><p>We all know that the PSNI is one of the most accountable police forces on the planet, quite frankly.  It is accountable to HMIC, CJINI and the ombudsman's office, and, ultimately, the Chief Constable is accountable to the Policing Board.  That same Chief Constable will now also have the responsibility of taking on whatever actions the NCA takes in Northern Ireland.  Ultimately, it will be accountable to the Policing Board.  I am sorely tempted to say that, as members of the Policing Board, we are going to have an awful lot on our plate in a short time, because we will now be accountable not only for the Chief Constable but for the NCA, and, ultimately, we are also going to be held to account by the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU).

That is something that has already been dealt with.  Danny Kennedy delivered the commitment that the Ulster Unionist Party and the then Executive made to ensure that the public would not pay domestic water rates through the Water and Sewerage Services (Amendment) Bill.  Members will remember that that Bill extended the period in which the Department for Regional Development will continue to pay a subsidy to Northern Ireland Water in lieu of domestic water charges.</p><p>The second part of the motion is the reason why we are seeking to amend it.  It seems to forget that, as contained within the Programme for Government, it was the Executive as a whole that agreed to defer the introduction of domestic water charges.  The decision that the Executive took to defer the introduction of charging should mean that the five Executive parties work together to make sure that the Department responsible is adequately resourced to ensure that water infrastructure can then be maintained to the highest standards.  Instead, we appear to be seeing some parties that are content to tell the public how they have resisted water charges as it makes them feel very popular but that are then doing nothing to assist the Minister who is faced with having to spread his ever-shrinking budget a little more thinly.</p><p>It is something that all the parties in the Executive &#8212; well, apart from the Alliance Party &#8212; have actually managed to unite around, yet the DUP seemingly cannot resist the opportunity to try to politically point score.  I hope that our amendment will receive the House's support today, as I believe it is a pragmatic proposal.</p><p>Given that the deferral of domestic water charges is something that the Executive as a collective have agreed to, it is only right that the onus should be on all five parties to work with the Minister to ensure that sufficient resources are made available to him to allow his Department to properly maintain water infrastructure in Northern Ireland.  This should be an issue where other parties are able to rise above the silo mentality that sadly too often permeates through the Executive.</p><p>We all need water.  It is a cross-cutting issue that affects us all equally.  That should be the motivation for every single one of us in the Chamber to ensure that the Department is adequately resourced to maintain the local water infrastructure and the high levels of water quality.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>Briefly.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for that interjection.  I know that the Water Service is very much aware of that, and I am assured that it is addressing it.</p><p>On occasions like this, it is not too difficult to see why the Alliance Party is considered to be the sister party of the Liberal Democrats.  A bit like their pals when they flip-flopped on tuition fees at the first sign of getting in through the door of Number 10, the Alliance Party is content to call for water charges, yet it supported the Bill that extended the period of time that DRD would pay a subsidy to Northern Ireland Water to protect the public from added pressure.  The Alliance Party will have the opportunity to outline why it would like to present families who are already stretched with yet another Bill to pay.  Remember that these are people who are already facing rising prices in their outgoings, such as electricity and gas.</p><p>The Ulster Unionist rationale for upholding this commitment is simple.  We believe in a society that is fair.  Families are finding themselves increasingly stretched.  Many, many people are struggling to balance the scale between income and bills, and the last thing that they need is the added pressure of a bill for water dropping through the letter box.  Bringing in universal water charging would mean bringing in an additional charge that would apply equally to all, affecting low-income families at the same rate that it would affect those who have the ability to pay.  That does not fit in with our definition of fairness.</p><p>The Assembly is often criticised for its lack of delivery, but the continued deferral of these charges, protecting some of the most vulnerable from the added pressure of an extra financial burden, has, I believe, been an example of the Assembly doing good for the people of Northern Ireland.</p><p>That is not to stifle debate around the future governance of water in Northern Ireland.  Of course we should always strive to do better.  We cannot afford to become complacent and just cruise along pointing to the fact that water charges have been deferred.  We should always be looking at the state of local infrastructure and assessing how we can improve it to best serve the people of Northern Ireland.  We should all be determined to make sure that our people have water coming out of their taps that is of the highest quality, and we should protect our environment by having fit-for-purpose sewerage services.</p><p>Historically, water infrastructure in this country has been underfunded, not least during the darker times when money was urgently needed in other areas and that infrastructure, unfortunately, did not receive the attention it deserved.  It is in that context that Danny Kennedy inherited it.  Since taking up the role of Minister for Regional Development, his drive has been to see certainty and stability and to create space to explore long-term options and governance models.</p><p>Sadly, today's motion seems to mirror the attitude of our friends in the DUP, and the Finance Minister, in failing to take central responsibility for the Belfast port &#163;20 million.  Members will remember that.  They lambasted the Minister for speaking about the implications there would be for core services, stemming from the cuts to his budget, and he received criticism from them over the concessionary fares scheme &#8212; another Executive priority that some parties are happy to lay claim to, but suddenly become shy when it comes to releasing the funds to retain it.</p><p>Danny Kennedy has upheld a Programme for Government commitment.  He should not face politicking activities by other Executive parties, such as today's motion, for seeing through something that most of them will try to take credit for.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>If you are quick.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>The Member has a long memory, but, unfortunately, he does not remember the detail of that.

This followed a report by the Northern Ireland Audit Office that showed a clear downward trend in sickness absence until 2012-13.</p><p>From the beginning, it was apparent that the Committee was looking at long-term sickness absence as a major concern.  The Northern Ireland Civil Service failed to meet its long-term sickness absence target for 2011-12.  The Audit Office report cautioned that the lack of progress in reducing the long-term absence rate posed a great risk to achieving the Programme for Government target of 8&#183;5 days for 2014-15.</p><p>The Committee also noted that the most recent NISRA report stated that, while the 2013-14 figure of 10&#183;1 average days lost per staff year was down from 10&#183;6 in the previous year, it was short of the annual target of nine days.  In 2012-13, the average for all Departments was 10&#183;6 days against the target of 9&#183;5 days.  In 2013-14, the Department's average was 10&#183;1 days against the target of nine days.  It was, however, good to note that there is a growing percentage of staff in the Northern Ireland Civil Service who took no sick leave during the entire year:  55&#183;3% in 2013-14, up from 52&#183;3% in 2012-13.  The Department of Finance and Personnel's own performance against targets for sickness absence was not met in 2013-14.  The actual figure was 9&#183;4 days against a target of 8&#183;1 days.  A concern for the Committee is that DFP and other Departments will have lower targets for future years, despite the fact that targets for previous years were not met.</p><p>On a happier note, which the Chair referred to, DFP officials from its corporate services division briefed the Finance and Personnel Committee on the Department's performance against business plan targets.  This will help to support DFP business areas to achieve the Department's overall sickness absence target of an average of 7&#183;6 days lost per staff year.  A partnership approach to absence management will be used.  HR business partner teams will monitor alongside managers, supporting them in taking on a larger role.  This is important in the early stages of sickness absence, and the concerted effort should help to get people back to work more quickly.  Compliance levels for sickness absence procedures have increased as a result of this action, and it is hoped that DFP will share its success with other Departments in an effort to replicate this success.</p><p>The Committee found that there were good practice policies in place for addressing sickness absence, and welcomed the introduction of health and well-being initiatives, such as the WELL programme, across Departments, and the trialing of new approaches as part of the sickness absence recovery strategy.  The Finance Committee remains concerned that the sickness levels in the Northern Ireland Civil Service continue to be higher than in the Great Britain Civil Service.  This fact gives great concern, especially when one considers that the voluntary exit scheme will have an effect on the overall figures.  There is a record of failure to achieve targets here, and it is my opinion that more effort is required to improve the situation.</p><p>With respect to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the health trusts, the Committee recommends that sickness absence targets be set to cover all trusts, including the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, which sets its own targets.  The Finance and Personnel Committee also noted the Committee for Education's separate scrutiny of sickness absence in the Department of Education and supported the various measures recommended.  There are potential savings of approximately &#163;37 million a year to be made to the public purse if the local public-sector sickness absences are brought into line with those of their equivalents in Great Britain.

We debated the subject at length, but it would appear that Sinn F&#233;in still does not understand the current economic situation.  We are emerging from a world economic crisis.  We did not have to be bailed out by others.  In fact, we are much more financially fit than our friends in the Republic of Ireland.  We did not need outside assistance to prevent us from going bankrupt.  It is also worth noting that the United Kingdom was able to assist with funds amounting to &#163;7&#183;5 billion as part of the &#163;85 billion bailout to the Irish Republic.  It is important to keep that in mind.  We are part of the United Kingdom, which is a major world economy, and that is a significant strength for us.</p><p>Economic governance from Dublin, which the Members opposite advocate, would have been a disaster.  Sinn F&#233;in would also have us believe that austerity measures were just an experiment conducted by the Westminster Government.  Why then did Portugal, Italy, Spain, Greece and other countries in the eurozone have the same problem?  Were the Tory cuts responsible for those austerity actions?  No, the Government at Westminster were taking prudent action to pay our debts following a worldwide recession.  The union with Britain brings us almost &#163;10 billion a year in the form of a top-up &#8212; a subvention above and beyond what we, as a region of the UK, are able to raise ourselves.  I trust that the signatories to the motion will be able to elucidate their economic theories with practical, researched examples of how we could raise the &#163;10 billion alone.  That did not happen in the previous debate, Mr Principal Deputy Speaker.</p><p>The motion calls on the British Government to pursue additional economic activity.  It is a pity that, despite contesting the forthcoming Westminster elections, Sinn F&#233;in does not use the opportunity to argue the case directly with all other Members in the UK Parliament.</p><p>It is just not enough to generalise about other sources of revenue or taxation.  One has to understand how they work and the effect that they may have on the economy as a whole.  Scotland has had tax-varying powers for several years and has not yet used them.  Scotland has obviously done its homework.  There are several taxes that could be transferred, but there is a cost to all of them.  Therefore, the economic benefit to be derived has to be set against the costs of the delegated tax.  That is why the Ulster Unionist Party was keen to have corporation tax devolved to Northern Ireland.  We know that that action will enable the Northern Ireland Assembly to develop our economy and that it will represent value for money.</p><p>It is interesting to note that statistics published last month show that Northern Ireland benefits from the Union.  The figures for 2013-14 show that public spending per head in the UK as a whole was &#163;8,936.  In England, it was &#163;8,678, which was 3% below the UK average.  Scotland enjoyed &#163;10,275, which was 15% above the UK average.  In Wales, it was &#163;9,924, which was 11% above the UK average.  In Northern Ireland, it was &#163;10,961, which was 23% above the UK average.</p><p>We are all working to grow the economy, because the creation of jobs is directly linked to the creation of wealth.  That enables people to pay tax, which, in turn, provides the cash to pay for vital services such as health, welfare and education.

It is also an opportunity for me, on behalf of the people whom I serve, to pay tribute to the doctors, nurses and all the staff, past and present, who have dedicated their life to striving to bring about and maintain a level of health care at the Causeway Hospital that has the capacity to be second to none and unequalled anywhere in the health service.</p><p>Last weekend, a visitor to our home took ill suddenly and had to be rushed by ambulance to the Causeway Hospital, where he received a level of care in A&amp;E and subsequently in medical ward 2 of the hospital that is, I believe, unequalled anywhere in the world.  No words could ever describe the life-saving medical treatment and care that our visitor received.  During those anxious hours in A&amp;E, while a dedicated team of doctors and nurses worked with our visitor to stabilise him, took X-rays and carried out complex tests, I had the opportunity to see the drama, certainly in my eyes, of the working of a fully functional emergency department.  I was amazed at what I saw and came to the conclusion that we must redouble our efforts to ensure that this wonderful facility, which people turn to in times of crisis, is secure for future generations.  There is no time to dwell, but I want every man, woman and child to know that, on their doorstep, there are the most wonderful people who are driven not by money or reward but by a vocation unique to the health service.</p><p>I also acknowledge recent decisions by the Northern Trust to make significant appointments at the Causeway Hospital that have helped to reduce anxiety about its future.  I just hope and pray that the Minister does not accept the one-size-fits-all approach that is based on a cost-cutting agenda and is perhaps more relevant to the health-care problems of large English cities.  My arguments are in no small way based on the work of the Causeway Hospital campaign group, which is made up of some of the most dedicated, skilled and experienced people associated with community issues and, in particular, health care.</p><p>The Donaldson report, which I referred to in my introduction, acknowledges that we are dealing with an ever-increasing ageing population, but it must be said that it has serious inconsistencies and contradictions that, I feel sure, the Minister must be and needs to be aware of.  Perhaps the worst of these is that Donaldson supports all acute services being provided by centrally located hospitals.  Only 10% to 15% of acute admissions require rapid or planned transfer to regional units, and there is universal agreement here that patients who need regionally based specialist services should be transferred, as they currently are, using the existing clinical networks, joint protocols and guidelines.  In that, there is no problem, disagreement or challenge and certainly no need to propose huge hikes in the salaries of senior and middle management, as suggested in the Donaldson report.  In the real-life case involving my visitor, I could see that clearly, as A&amp;E handed over the patient to another team of specialists who followed through the care that was needed to ensure a short stay in the hospital.  This is the only sensible way to ensure that A&amp;E is a seamless part of the hospital function.  The 85% to 90% who do not require transfer to specialist hospitals should be treated locally, and it is here that we must ensure that the Causeway Hospital remains an acute centre of medical excellence for the vast majority of patients who have no need to be transferred to other hospitals or undertake long journeys, adding to stress, inconvenience and the cost of travelling to Belfast through a heavily congested city with poor public transport and parking.</p><p>There is much more to the fatally flawed report by Donaldson, and a lot of it is already obvious.  The potential swamping of centre facilities that should be kept for their speciality role must be avoided, but it is already happening with headline news all too often.  The unnecessary and intolerable strain placed on the Ambulance Service is already well established, with 96% of paramedic staff reporting stress and other health problems relating to work.</p><p>In the case of the Causeway Hospital, if such a daft proposal were to be followed through, it would mean the deskilling and erosion of the confidence of local medical and nursing staff, and that would be a tragedy because I know of no staff more dedicated, more committed and more representative of a health service that puts patients at the centre of its work.</p><p>I plead with the Minister not to accept the recommendations of consultants hook, line and sinker, particularly when those recommendations are plucked out of another area which is quite unlike and unrepresentative of our own. Remember, this is the man &#8212; I am talking about Donaldson &#8212; who was called on to resign by the British Medical Association when he was Chief Medical Officer in England after producing a highly controversial report on modernising medical careers.  His record is not without blemish.  In our case, he has produced a one-dimensional, management-centred, financially driven report that completely ignores patient-centred local factors.</p><p>The Assembly had a difficult birth and its adolescence has not been without trouble, but surely the one thing that we must agree on is our ability to make decisions that suit our people present and future, particularly when there is universal agreement on what should happen for the best reasons.</p><p>The arguments for ensuring that the Causeway Hospital remains an acute hospital have been well made by people locally who have worked in the service and dedicated their life to it and by those who have experienced the highest standards of care while they have been patients in that hospital.  We all know that nothing remains the same and that change is inevitable, but change must be for the better and must be based on sound judgement and not on the back of a report from an author who does not share the experience of those who have worked in the hospital for a lifetime and know much better what works and what would be a disaster not just for the Causeway Hospital but for the health service as a whole.</p><p>In bringing about change, I welcome the increased collaboration between the Causeway Hospital and Altnagelvin Area Hospital.  It is something that the previous Minister of Health, Edwin Poots, advocated, and I was pleased to see the current Minister, Jim Wells, in Altnagelvin this week. This is not a one-way street but a genuine exercise in sending patients in both directions to bring about higher levels of specialisation not just for the Causeway Hospital but for the Derry-based hospital, which has important links with Letterkenny General Hospital.  Surely, that is good practice that protects the accident and emergency service.  We must not allow our accident and emergency service to become simply a shopfront for patients who would be transferred to Belfast hospitals.</p><p>Time and again, we are told about problems with the recruitment of senior and middle-grade medical staff over the last five years.  That could be corrected by clear investment in the future.  Recent appointments and the apparent drive to create new partnerships can remove the uncertainty and will, with little doubt, stimulate interest in applying for posts in the Causeway Hospital and in Altnagelvin.  I saw evidence of that at first hand when people from different parts of the world worked in harmony as a team to deliver a health service that is, without doubt, fit for purpose.</p><p>It is interesting to note that, since its official opening in 2001, the Causeway Hospital has had no capital investment, while Antrim has had very heavy investment.  It is now time to reassess that strategy and to recognise that previous attempts to centralise services 30 miles away were flawed.  Perhaps the recent appointments that I referred to are the first visible signs of intent to reverse that policy.  I hope so.  That needs to be underlined.</p><p>In accepting it is time for change, let us make sure that we put the present and the future needs of the community that the Causeway Hospital serves at the top of our agenda.  In doing so, let us remember that easy and rapid access to local hospital services is essential, providing as a minimum the services that currently exist at that hospital.  That is key.</p><p>Let us be reminded that Transforming Your Care has emphasised the need for closer working cooperation between hospitals and community services, with more care to be delivered outside the hospital.  The Causeway is ideally suited to develop that concept in view of the already effective links, with GP practices and specialist nurses crossing the hospital/community interface and with the presence of two GP-run community hospitals.  Let us learn from the blunders made in other areas, such as Mid Staffordshire, where the disintegration of the health service led to a renewed focus on the basics of general medical and nursing care.  The recent report 'Future Hospital' emphasises the need for generalists, rather than super-specialists, to take responsibility for inpatient care and to respond in particular to the increasing prevalence of elderly patients with multi-morbidity.  The Causeway is well placed to respond to that.</p><p>I emphasised the need for partnership and integration with other providers, but that must be on the basis that the Causeway is not in any way diminished in its core values as an acute hospital not only in name but in practice. The Causeway serves a population of at least 150,000, rising intermittently to 200,000, and caters for a mobile student population.  I suggest that it would be utter madness to allow a situation to develop where people would have to travel 40 miles to Antrim or a similar distance to Altnagelvin, leaving a huge area isolated.  In that respect, we must use our influence as a local Assembly to rise above those consultants' reports and to do what is best for our people.  We should not leave it to a future generation to undo the harm that would be done if a report such as Donaldson's were implemented in its entirety.  We need to question those reports and ask who is writing them and what superior knowledge they have over local medical doctors who have spent their entire lifetime working in this area.</p><p>Please do not let the hospitals become another railway story.  Do not let Donaldson become like the Beeching blunder of the 60s, when thousands of miles of railways were closed down on the back of an ill-informed report that almost destroyed the railway system. Indeed, since that, many of those railways have had to be reopened.</p><p>We need to go for it and tackle all the factors that made the Causeway less attractive for recruitment and training.  I mentioned collaboration with other hospitals, but in-house training is also vital and demands immediate plans to gain recognition and re-accreditation for a wonderful hospital that deserves to be the flagship of health care covering the entire north-west and beyond.</p><p>The Causeway can and will move with the times.  It has already demonstrated that it can deliver acute hospital services that are safe, of high quality, sustainable and effective.  The challenge to the Assembly and to our Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is this: will you rise above Donaldson?  Will you back a winner and give direction to those who are responsible for the long-term planning of health care in the Causeway area?  Will you tell them that you believe passionately in the people who make the Causeway the hospital what it is and can be in the future?  Will you ensure that there is capital investment and local leadership in planning the future?  Will you avoid the blunders of past consultants who had no mandate and little knowledge of the areas that they reported on?  Will you prevent them causing a future train wreck of a different type, involving the health and well-being of our people?</p><p>In drawing to a conclusion, I know that there are many issues that I have not dealt with, such as the ongoing management of palliative care, midwifery and the relationship with the Ulster University.  Hopefully, others will pick up on those and other important issues.  I look forward to other MLAs' contributions, because this is a task that we must do together.  I particularly want to hear the Minister's response, whom I have confidence in, to the most important issues facing the people whom I and others represent now and in the future.</p><p>The Causeway Hospital has not let us down, the people who serve in it have not let us down, and God forbid that the Assembly lets the Causeway down.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>2.

Up until 2016, I believe that it is an Executive priority to ensure that no additional burdens are placed on the people's shoulders to fund charges.  That policy should continue, and it is the responsibility of the Assembly and the Executive to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to maintain the local water infrastructure.  The historical neglect was mentioned by the Chairperson of the Committee, and I will go back to that later.  Money is needed to improve water and sanitation, and, down the years, particularly during direct rule, the service was robbed of that money.</p><p>On a positive note, in recent times, there has been an unrecognisable improvement in the delivery of the service, but sadly not before a near collapse because of the ineptness and incompetence of the former chief executive, Laurence MacKenzie, and, indeed, the Minister of the day, Conor Murphy.

In that respect, the British Government need to accept that, during direct rule, millions of pounds of funding was switched from water to security.

It is difficult to describe them as good years, whether it has been cuts, foreign policy or a wide range of other issues that that Government have embarked on for all citizens in the United Kingdom.  I welcome the opportunity for a change of Government in Whitehall, but the wording of the motion somewhat perturbs me. It calls for Members to be returned to seek:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the best possible outcomes for Northern Ireland\".</p><p>Surely that is what the 18 Members of the last mandate in Westminster must and should have been doing.  Certainly, I know one Member who has been doing that: Naomi Long, the Member for East Belfast. She has been delivering for the citizens of Northern Ireland and for the people of East Belfast.  She voted in over half of the divisions in the previous Parliament, and she has been a strong voice for progressive politics in many areas. She influences, and, if Sinn F&#233;in wants to know about welfare cuts and why it feels that its abstentionism has benefited the citizens of Northern Ireland, you only have to look to the record of an MP like Naomi Long, who has influenced legislation at Westminster to the point of change.</p><p>Of course, let us look, by stark contrast, at the party that tabled the motion.  Its leader has only voted in 27 % of the Divisions.  In fact, Dr McDonnell cost the taxpayer over &#163;3,000 for every vote that he makes in Westminster.  I will leave it up to the Members of this House to decide whether that is money well spent or not.  How on earth can we be expected to take lessons on influencing government from the SDLP, when it only shows up for 27% of the votes?  Perhaps Dr McDonnell can confirm to the electorate &#8212; of course, he is not here today &#8212; whether he will continue the shameful double-jobbing, providing a poor service to his constituents and ignoring the consensus that it is a disgraceful situation to maintain.</p><p>That brings us to the elephant in the room: the party that stands for election but does not take its seats.  The party that complains, grandstands and allows us to be vulnerable to Tory cuts but cannot bring itself to do the right things and represent its constituents where it matters.  All that stands in stark contrast to the Member for East Belfast, Naomi Long.  She does not have two or three jobs, she has one job: representing the citizens of East Belfast with energy, enthusiasm and dedication.  She will do that again in this election.</p><p>It is time that Members of Parliament, whatever party they come from in Northern Ireland, stop taking out the begging bowl and, instead, want to be returned as confident Members of Parliament to try to move this country forward. I hate to pour cold water on the coalition ambitions of the parties here, but what sane party of national government in the United Kingdom would go near either the DUP or the SDLP? The DUP is a party that talks about British emblems and symbols but wishes to exempt Northern Ireland from the social progress made in the rest of the United Kingdom and is keen to ignore British values of liberal democracy and tolerance.  It is a party that does not have a single female candidate.</p><p>The SDLP is similar.  It has a leader whose views on a range of issues would likely see that Member excluded from its sister party.  It cannot even keep to its word here in Stormont on such key agreements as the Stormont House Agreement, so how on earth would any national Government trust it in Westminster?  Of course, ultimately, Sinn F&#233;in is just a bystander in the real politics of Westminster, never mind its baggage.</p><p>Once again, this should be about taking Northern Ireland forward, stepping out and stepping up on behalf of all the citizens of Northern Ireland.  Sadly, the citizens of East Belfast cannot have the choice of Mrs Dobson's party because it is not standing there.  This is not about cash; this is about building a Northern Ireland that all our citizens can be proud of, a Northern Ireland that will stop being the illiberal backwater it is so often perceived as, so that we can play a meaningful and proud role representing all the citizens of Northern Ireland.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Westminster Elections"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the important issue that we are dealing with today.  I support the motion and the amendment.</p><p>As others have said, fuel laundering has been a worrying, damaging and pervasive problem in Northern Ireland.  Although it is primarily an excepted matter, HMRC and local authorities have been working to tackle the problem for many years.  Many people see fuel laundering as a victimless crime, as has been said, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Many are terrorised by criminal gangs in their own community.  They are not only being terrorised, but, as Mr McGlone said, they are being poisoned by their neighbours, by people whom they may go to church with or shop with &#8212; people whom they know in their own community.</p><p>Environmental damage is inflicted by criminals who dump toxic sludge with wanton disregard in our countryside, waste that, as others have said, ends up in our rivers, lakes and water supplies, killing wildlife and foliage and contaminating land and water.  Meanwhile, the bill is left to us, the ordinary tax-paying public.  Between June 2012 and December 2014, the Environment Agency cleared some 340 incidences of fly-tipping of fuel-laundered waste involving nearly 3,000 tonnes of material at a cost of nearly &#163;1 million.  That money, as others have said, could be spent on schools, hospitals and other public services.</p><p>I believe that we are beginning to turn the tide of fuel laundering.  Thirty-eight plants were dismantled last year, compared with 13 in 2003-04.  The price of fuel has tumbled, as we know, making this crime perhaps less profitable, but, as others have said, the proceeds of these crimes are being turned to other crimes.  Furthermore, this month, HMRC introduced new red diesel dye in coordination with authorities in the Republic of Ireland. HMRC expects that action to stamp down on fuel laundering massively &#8212; we will see &#8212; putting it out of the reach of the majority of criminals.  I hope that that will be the case.  I also expect the National Crime Agency's full resources and time, much of which we were deprived of for over a year, to now help with tackling this form of organised crime.  That is why I will gladly support the amendment proposed by the SDLP today.</p><p>As I mentioned, tax evasion is mostly an excepted matter and a UK-wide matter.  Nonetheless, the problem cannot be dealt with on only one side of the border.  It requires a holistic approach across the entire island, and, therefore, I am encouraged by the unprecedented levels of cooperation between the PSNI and the garda&#237;.  Nevertheless, we need greater political commitment here to truly tackle this on the ground and in local communities with the assistance of the Policing Board and the policing and community safety partnerships.</p><p>Others have referred to who some of the criminal gangs may be.  I read with interest the comments of the Irish EU Agriculture Commissioner, Phil Hogan, in March, in which he asserted:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is clear the criminal gangs involved in fuel rackets have breakaway paramilitaries among their members.  Some of these are close to the political process and some of their windfall gains may be making their way into the political process.\"</p><p>I find that deeply troubling, and, if that is the case for any of the participants, they should immediately cease such activities and work with the police to end this debased and highly illegal industry.

He has also reminded us that to deal with this case the House and wider society in Northern Ireland need to be able to come together to deal with the very complex, very difficult, very hurtful and very important issue of how we deal with the past as a society.</p><p>I do not think I can go any further this morning in this case than by repeating the words of the Minister of Justice:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there is no stain on Colin Worton's character; he was acquitted by the court.\"</p><p>Thank you.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: UDR Four"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I beg to move the following amendment:</p><p class=\"italic\">Leave out all after \"further notes\" and insert\n\n\"the previous comments of the Minister of Justice that Colin Worton was found by the proper authorities of the law to be not guilty of any crime associated with the death of Adrian Carroll; and concludes that the inability of the Minister of Justice to provide compensation in no way undermines Mr Worton's innocence.\".</p><p>I think, like most people, we will have real sympathy for the experience of Colin Worton.  It is deeply regrettable that he was ever placed in this position. I have spoken to the Minister of Justice at length on the issue.  His Department has looked at the case from a wide variety of angles and with appropriate advice.  Indeed, there was a review of it following the evidence of the Historical Enquiries Team (HET).  However, unfortunately, it is simply outside the Department of Justice's abilities to provide compensation for Mr Worton because he was never actually convicted of a crime.  I trust that the Minister will further develop on this detail.  However, it is at the very heart and crux of the matter that Mr Worton is not eligible for compensation because, unlike the three others convicted at trial in that case, he was acquitted.  It is for that reason that I propose the amendment to the motion today:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that Colin Worton was found by the proper authorities of the law to be not guilty of any crime associated with the death of Adrian Carroll; and concludes that the inability of the Minister of Justice to provide compensation in no way undermines Mr Worton's innocence.\"</p><p>The Minister of Justice cannot provide compensation to Mr Worton as he has, I believe and understand, not the means to do this.  However, the House can clearly and unequivocally state that, although the Department of Justice is not in a position to provide compensation, it remains plainly the fact that Mr Worton has been acquitted of the murder of Adrian Carroll, something that we must clearly highlight.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: UDR Four"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I will, yes.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: UDR Four"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I hear what Mr Allister says, and, indeed, my next line will perhaps explain my difficulty in answering him.

A Labour Government in 2010 would still have had to implement austerity policies.  The collapse of the eurozone devastated the economies of the Republic of Ireland, Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal.  The reality we face is that, in a bid to balance the books, there have been cuts in public spending in every English region plus Scotland and Wales, as well as Northern Ireland. We receive a subvention of &#163;10 billion per year in Northern Ireland.  The price of the Union is that we share in the national wealth when times are good and carry our share of the burden when times are not so good.</p><p>With regard to welfare provisions, there is no bottomless pit of money.  We really must seek to put in place the welfare state we can afford.  Since its inception in the post-war consensus of 1945, it has expanded massively and expensively.  It should be a safety net and not a lifestyle choice.  We should reform all aspects of public services to ensure that we deliver value for money and operate as effectively as possible.</p><p>It should go without saying that every Northern Ireland MP elected to Westminster should at all times seek to represent and do the best for his or her constituents.  It is in the Mother of Parliaments that key decisions are taken on taxation, welfare and defence.  That is what makes Sinn F&#233;in's policy of abstention futile.  How can you complain about the impact of a policy when you could not be bothered to turn up when it was being debated? Instead of sitting on the green Benches of Westminster, Sinn F&#233;in MPs adopt an approach of sitting on their hands.  Would it not have made more sense to take their seats in the House of Commons and engage in debates on issues such as the Budget, taxation and welfare reform?  There was a time when republicans pledged \"No return to Stormont\", yet here we all are.  Perhaps one day they may take their seats at Westminster and represent the people who choose to elect them.

A stable Union is the most important result a good unionist should hope for in the election. Ulster Unionist MPs will be responsible citizens of the United Kingdom and will defend, promote and advance the Union at this time of immense uncertainty.

Fundamental to that right is that people can be safe in the knowledge that, when an emergency occurs and 999 is called, help is on its way as quickly as possible.  Locally located response teams are central to speedy response times for all emergency services, which brings me to the point of this debate.</p><p>The plans for a radical shake-up of neighbourhood policing in E district, which encompasses Upper Bann, are frankly unworkable and unacceptable.  They would see neighbourhood policing teams relocated from Portadown and Banbridge police stations to Armagh and Lurgan.  That would affect policing in all towns and rural areas across Upper Bann.  In recent years, in Banbridge, we have witnessed the loss of neighbourhood policing teams from Gilford, Rathfriland and Dromore, with responses now centred in Banbridge station.  This is an issue that is worrying for local people but also concerns the members of the Banbridge chamber of commerce. It was the first issue raised with me when I met them recently.</p><p>While I very much welcome the ongoing and open dialogue with Superintendent David Moore, who will be the new district commander for the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon policing area, I am concerned that this decision has been handed to him from above.  Indeed, in a recent lengthy meeting, we raised considerable concerns around response times, burglaries, reducing incidences of violent crime and responses to road traffic accidents, not least on the A1 dual carriageway and our country roads.  The A1 dual carriageway is the main corridor between Belfast and Dublin and has been utilised by criminals seeking a speedy exit from the town.  We also discussed how the PSNI works with the policing and community safety partnership (PCSP) to raise awareness of the harm caused by use of illegal drugs; the impact of rural crime, which is a very real concern locally, especially for vulnerable elderly people; the fear that hearing that teams will not be stationed locally could cause those elderly people; and the future of neighbourhood watch teams &#8212; in short, the key policing priorities across the constituency.</p><p class=\"italic\">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Beggs] in the Chair)</p><p>I am deeply worried that decisions are being taken by PSNI management on a short-term basis rather than as part of a real, long-term strategic vision for the future of policing in the area.  Residents across Upper Bann, including our rural areas, are set to suffer the consequences.  The lack of consultation is shocking.  Community groups across the constituency have built up and are building up good working relationships with the police through individual officers working on the ground.  Where is their voice in all of this?</p><p>That work is vital in establishing a network that can help to combat crime, and I am sure that I am not alone in being able to recount examples where those relationships have led directly to positive policing outcomes.</p><p>Like the health service or any other Department that comes under the remit of the House, the budget for policing in Northern Ireland was set in 2011 in a Budget that my party opposed.  If we were discussing the closure or relocation of key staff from a health centre or fire station, we could hold the responsible Minister directly to account &#8212; local accountability for decisions that will affect local families and our local communities.  In the case of the most radical shake-up of community policing for decades, in which communities are set to suffer, different rules apply.</p><p>The fact that we are discussing the future of policing in Upper Bann and there is no ministerial response shows a total lack of accountability and responsibility for those who will be affected.  I understand that the Minister deemed, as he does with questions for written answers, that the issue is an operational matter that is within the remit of the PSNI.  In short, elected representatives at all levels are simply informed and PCSPs are briefed.  I am in no way arguing for the direct involvement of the House in policing priorities in Northern Ireland; those systems are in place.  However, I am concerned at the lack of local accountability that has been a direct result of the way in which policing and justice was devolved to the House.  When it comes to radical decisions, such as the relocation of response teams, there should be local accountability.</p><p>I am also concerned at Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris's comments yesterday, when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We are facing unprecedented financial cuts and it is inevitable these cuts will impact policing.\"</p><p>He continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"By April 2016 we will have around 200 fewer officers due to high number of officers retiring and limited scope for recruitment.\"</p><p>He further continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Going forward there is likely to be further reductions in officer numbers.\"</p><p>Those comments, coming on the same day as it was announced that the police are to hand back a &#163;14 million underspend from last year, simply beggar belief.  It does little for public confidence to hear that operational policing is set to totally move out of local stations.  It does even less to hear that a shortage of front-line officers is looming while unspent money is being handed back.</p><p>The future of policing in Upper Bann is an extremely important issue for each and every family.  I pay tribute to the officers of the neighbourhood policing teams in stations across the constituency and commend them for the work that they do to keep our community safe.</p><p>I appeal to the Justice Minister, if he takes the time to read the Hansard report of the debate, to look at how those radical proposals will impact on the future of policing in Upper Bann; to consider the increased potential for serious road traffic accidents as response vehicles travel further distances across our rural roads to respond to emergencies; and to consider the impact on communities in already isolated rural areas and the damage that will be wielded to important policing work that is under way.</p><p>I would also appreciate his assessment of the use of the community prioritisation index, which underpins the proposal to centre command in Banbridge and remove operational policing.  Two of the key indices are deprivation and crime levels and, when applied to Banbridge, we simply do not score highly enough.  Is that really how that decision has come about?  Good work on the ground by police reduces crime, and Banbridge should not be penalised for successful policing.  I would also appreciate an assurance that the current teams in Banbridge will be kept in place until at least October and will not be removed before then.</p><p>As it stands, I understand that the PSNI still does not know how the new proposed system will work in practice with the role profiles and shift patterns for officers.  It is also frightening to think that, as Lurgan requires armoured cars, we could have the farce of officers responding from Lurgan and travelling in armoured vehicles and possibly arriving in Banbridge to get into their standard response vehicles to go out on duty and then return to Lurgan in their armoured cars.  Their plans could increase costs rather than decrease them.  When you think of the cost that is incurred in moving officers in a greater number of vehicles and increased fuel and travel times, frankly, it does not add up.  That is not even thinking of the increased response times that people could face.  These proposals are dangerous and totally unworkable.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Policing: Upper Bann"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>T6.

I also welcome the timely nature of the debate, given that, as Members who spoke previously said, yesterday was International Women's Day.</p><p>The Ulster Unionist Party welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the AERC's consultation, and my party has historical roots in promoting women.  Indeed, the Ulster Women's Unionist Council continues to make an important contribution to this day, and I pay tribute to its officers and members.  The council was established back in 1911 to encourage women to develop and contribute politically and to ensure representation at the highest levels within the party.  I am proud to serve as the council's chair for my constituency of Upper Bann.</p><p>Every year, schools across Northern Ireland send pupils to take part in the Edgar Graham public speaking competition, which is held in the Senate Chamber.

I would also like to pay tribute to the staff of the Assembly's Education Service for the invaluable work that they do, and I know that their role is appreciated by Members across the House.  I cannot emphasise enough how important it is for pupils and their teachers to come to this Building, and I am pleased that the Committee's findings acknowledged the importance of the education sector in encouraging women to consider a career in politics.</p><p>I welcome the outcome and the recommendations of the review.  If politics and political decision-making in Northern Ireland are to become more reflective of society, there is undoubtedly a greater requirement for female representation.  It is only by making politics more attractive to young women that we will truly see that future becoming a reality for the next generation of our political leaders.</p><p>Another issue that Michael McGimpsey and I have raised on a number of occasions in the Chamber is the lack of female representation at the top of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.  While I welcome the Committee's recommendation that Ministers commit to addressing inequality, this should be led from the top of the Civil Service; it is a job for the Finance Minister, and one that needs urgent action to address.  That leadership should come from the top.  My party will continue to assist and empower the next generation of politicians.</p><p>I want to pay tribute to the councillors who will take up their new roles in the super-councils on 1 April; many of them will be first-time councillors and many are women.

Abigail, who is studying at Lurgan College, was elected just last week as a Member of the UK Youth Parliament for Upper Bann.  She is an example of a young woman engaging in public life.  As Members, we all need to be conscious of nurturing that interest to create the public representatives of the future.  I had the privilege of having Abigail shadow me at work at Stormont recently and of watching her campaign successfully.  She has a bright future ahead of her and I look forward to supporting her in that new role.  I also pay tribute to the close runner-up, Adam Kinneen from Banbridge Academy, and all the entrants across Northern Ireland, candidates, teachers, teams and elected MYPs.  They have done so much for their schools and have made Northern Ireland proud.  What they have achieved is in the spirit of the Committee's report:  increasing interest and representation amongst women.</p><p>In conclusion, young women will follow role models.  I feel that it is for this House to lead by example.  It is for Members to inspire and not to deflect young women, or indeed young men, from entering politics and to nurture their interest wherever we find it.  I pay tribute to the Education Service, the teachers and pupils who come to Parliament Buildings, and also to the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association for profiling issues that females are raising in Parliaments across the Commonwealth.</p><p>I welcome many of the Committee's recommendations, but the point that I make is that we must inspire change and not force it.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Women in Politics and the Northern Ireland Assembly: Review Report"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for his statement.

It was a useful exercise for the Committee to review the Department's tackling rural poverty and social inclusion framework.  It confirmed what many of us will have expected, which is that individual programmes are making important progress in the areas in which they are operating.</p><p>Throughout the review, the Committee took evidence from a range of stakeholders, which included specific organisations and schemes being singled out for praise.  One that I would like to highlight &#8212; it has been mentioned before &#8212; is the very important farm families health checks programme.  Agriculture is not only a job but a way of life for many of our farmers.  Unfortunately, however, it is a lifestyle particularly susceptible to health challenges.  Those can range from the problems connected to working long hours in a physically demanding job to isolation from health services that many other people have easy access to and do not think twice about attending.  I include in that list of challenges the mental health anguish often associated with living and working in isolation and the impact of working hard for low or below farmgate prices.  The health checks programme has been a potentially life-saving programme to farmers right across Northern Ireland.  It flags up early warning signals, and farmers are often then signposted on.</p><p>I pay tribute to the teams of nurses who work from the portable units in all types of weather and from all sorts of locations.  Their work is to be commended and their impact on farming and rural families cannot be underestimated.  I feel that it was a sensible decision to concentrate efforts on regional livestock markets.  It makes sense to try to grasp the attention of as many farmers as possible in one location.  In fact, I reckon that the current mobile units are becoming so much of a permanent fixture that it would cause issues in the farming community if they were to be removed.  I know that a number of charities, including those that focus on mental health challenges, are considering making bids for European funding as a result of seeing the excellent work of these mobile units.  Can the Minister detail what impact, if any, the recent reductions to the Public Health Agency's budget will have on the health checks?  In regard to her own budget, does she believe that this is the type of programme that should be protected?   I share the Committee's concern that next year's budget for the so-called tackling rural poverty and social isolation framework was allocated according to convenience rather than need.</p><p>The Committee was especially impressed to hear the glowing reports about the MARA project.  It is no surprise that it has been so busy.  Our rural population is often older, and we need to bear in mind the condition of some of the housing stock in our rural areas.  Many people have lived in their current homes all their lives, and many other homes have passed from one generation to another.  It was inevitable that these farmhouses could have benefited  from additional energy-saving measures, and I am pleased that many have had elements of that work done.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, fuel poverty remains a major and uncompromising issue in rural areas.  Some of this can, of course, be put down to the absence of natural gas and the subsequent reliance on oil, which, until recently, was becoming one of the largest household outgoings.  However, I believe that even more could and should be done to target these homes.  The old warm homes scheme worked well for those who benefited from it, but the number of those homes was too few and the cost of the scheme was too high.  It is imperative that our rural roads and laneways are not overlooked by councils because other streets of houses are easier to reach.  That may be the case, but deprivation and fuel poverty do not discriminate between those who live in urban and rural areas.</p><p>There is a range of other challenges facing our rural dwellers, some of which are addressed in this Committee review and others are not.  I will cite just two.  The ongoing absence of affordable childcare is often a major barrier to parents in rural areas taking up and sustaining employment.  Another major problem right now, and an absolute contradiction to the supposed attempts to tackle rural isolation, is the reduction of care in the community, especially of essential services like home helps.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Tackling Rural Poverty and Social Inclusion Framework"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>To conclude, while there has been progress made, not least in the TRPSI framework, there is still much more that needs to be done.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Tackling Rural Poverty and Social Inclusion Framework"}, {"date": "2015-02-24", "body": "<p>6.

I can honestly say that it is one of the best decisions that I have made this century.</p><p>I would certainly encourage all those MLAs who do not cycle to consider cycling and to get on their bike.  For me, especially in the early days, I came across areas of east Belfast that I did not know existed &#8212; some wee streets &#8212; but you also get to see the issues as you cycle along those streets and roads that you certainly would not see driving past in your car.  The only regret that I have about cycling is that I did not embark on it when I was much younger.  I wish that I had done that.</p><p>Last year, as a birthday treat, my family sent me and my wife to Utrecht in the Netherlands for a few days, and I experienced cycling there.  It was the first time in my life that I had been in a traffic jam of cyclists.  There were hundreds and hundreds of cyclists, and it was a new experience for me.</p><p>I believe that the Minister is personally and genuinely committed to a cycling revolution, and I am glad that that revolution is under way.  I see it on a weekly basis.</p><p>I recently spoke to a person whom you will know, Mr Principal Deputy Speaker, Glenn Kinning, who runs a cycle repair and sales business on the Castlereagh Road.  He told me that, since last year and the Giro d'Italia, the number of parents who are coming in to buy bicycles for themselves and their children has increased dramatically,  The cycling revolution is definitely under way, and an increase in cycling has led to an increase in business for the Kinnings and other cycling businesses.  Sales of bicycles and bicycle equipment are definitely up.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Cycling: Benefits to the Economy"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>I will.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Cycling: Benefits to the Economy"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>Thank you, Mr Principal Deputy Speaker.

He is from Lisburn, and he told me that he drives from Lisburn to Victoria Park in east Belfast.  The reason he does that is not just that it is a wonderful park with beautiful scenery, ducks, swans and everything else but because of the quality of its good, clean surfaces on which his children can actually cycle in safety.  That is very important as well.</p><p>I am certainly aware, as all MLAs are, that money is scarce.

I hope that this does not trigger a point of order, as happened earlier.  The Minister says that he believes that:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the order and the motion, which would be subject to Westminster consent, provide an opportunity for the National Crime Agency to add more of its expertise to the law enforcement effort against organised crime groups here.\"</p><p>I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister.  I sincerely believe that some Members are looking a gift horse in the mouth.  Let us see what they are potentially rejecting.  This morning, I looked up the NCA website.  It says that the NCA is a new crime-fighting agency with:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"national and international reach and the mandate and powers to work in partnership with other law enforcement organisations to bring the full weight of the law to bear on serious and organised criminals.\"</p><p>Is this not what the majority of people in our communities want:  the full weight of the law being brought to bear in cutting serious and organised crime?  I suggest that, if we went round the doors tonight and spoke to people in Belfast and across Northern Ireland, the overwhelming majority would agree with the new agency being set up and would support it.</p><p>Earlier, I spoke to a senior PSNI officer, who informed me that organised crime is growing and becoming more sophisticated.  There are more international crime gangs in Northern Ireland, including, he said, Russians.  Those gangs are operating across Belfast, across Northern Ireland, across the border, in the rest of the United Kingdom and, as we all know, across Europe.  Is this not a wake-up call for all of us in the House to support the motion?  I understand that some Members may have concerns about transparency and accountability.  However, the order will provide a vehicle to hit criminals where it hurts most and would do so in a way that places the PSNI at the heart of decision-making on operations.  It also provides a role for the Policing Board to monitor the exercise of NCA functions, to call the director general of the NCA to meetings and to call for reports, updates on progress and so on.</p><p>And there is more:  the Police Ombudsman also has a full role.  I agree with the Minister, who is clear that the order will fill a gap in our law enforcement effort that he, as Justice Minister and chair of the Organised Crime Task Force, and our Chief Constable have highlighted for some time.</p><p>I believe that NCA operations will be subject to significant and robust accountability arrangements, because of those assurances and the ability for the agency to respond &#8212; let us not forget it &#8212; on a 24/7 basis to target those in our communities &#8212; the criminals, the blackguards and the groups &#8212; who pose the greatest risk to the people of Northern Ireland and beyond.

I am not saying that low impact is no impact, but fortunately, due to the swift reporting of the incident and the swift reaction to that report, a more major incident was avoided.  Contrary, however, to the report in the 'Ulster Herald', DOE and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency do not have a role in maintaining rivers, other than in securing improvements in water quality.

In adopted watercourses, the Rivers Agency may remove fallen animals if river flows are impeded.  Where flow is not impeded and the fallen animal is a public health issue, which, as the Member outlined, they tend to be on occasion, it is a local council responsibility to ensure that appropriate action is taken.</p><p>Fallen animals dumped on private land, however, do become the responsibility of the landowner.  Local councils can serve a notice on the landowner to dispose of a carcass if it is a public health nuisance.  Riparian owners on either riverbank are legally responsible for the river up to its central line.  In the past, some local councils have removed fallen animals from private land; I know that Derry City Council has been good at doing so in the past.

I think that it is a very important vehicle through which councils can take a real hands-on approach to improving the economy, the environment, and their own area's social health and well-being.  I put environment in the middle there, but I think it is very much a central plank of what new councils could and should be doing.</p><p>Regarding the powers that have transferred to allow them to do that, councils clearly have in their own gift the ability to have their own waste policies.  Many of them do, and they are working together in their new councils to formulate waste policies that not only prove to be good value to the ratepayer but that help us, as NI plc, to meet European targets.  If you look at the estate of councils, such as the number of public buildings that they have and vehicles that they own, you will see that all councils will already be looking, as purely a cost-saving exercise, at how they can reduce energy use.

This viewpoint has been endorsed by the Department and is recorded in Hansard.  Sustrans described the vision as more of an aim rather than being truly visionary.  It is strange that the Department's draft strategy does not set Northern Ireland-wide targets.  I do not believe that zero targets would encourage people to use a bicycle in their local community.

There is no doubt that all of us in the House want to see safety on our roads improved to save lives or have one less person injured on our roads.  That is what makes this a worthwhile cause to consider.</p><p>Research from the Department for Transport shows that, if a pedestrian is hit by a vehicle travelling at 20 mph, there is a 2&#183;15% chance, or a one in 40 chance, of them being killed, or a 97&#183;5% chance of them actually surviving.  Compare that with a pedestrian hit by a car travelling at 30 mph.  There is a 20% chance, or one in five chance, of them being killed, or an 80% chance of survival.  That represents a 17% better chance of survival by reducing the speed limit from 30 mph to 20 mph and is why the Bill is worthy of discussion and being taken very seriously.  However, we need to take a closer look at the practicalities of being able to take a blanket 20 mph approach across all 30 mph roads in Northern Ireland.</p><p>What do DRD and the PSNI have to say about it at this stage?  When taking evidence at the Regional Development Committee from Chief Inspector Pennington, there was acknowledgement that there was concern about the blanket approach proposed in the Bill for all roads.  The PSNI said that it would prefer that the model was a bottom-up approach coming from demand from the community, primarily in residential areas.  PSNI surveys seemed to suggest that drivers in those areas tend to drive closer to a 20 mph speed limit than a 30 mph speed limit.  I acknowledge that Mr Ramsey has said that he is going to look at the blanket approach and maybe curtail it.</p><p>Another area of concern from the PSNI was the ability to enforce such speed limits.  Comments made by the PSNI were that it is seen as \"excessive and over the top\" and a challenge to enforce.  That begs the question that, if this cannot be enforced across the whole of Northern Ireland, is a blanket 20 mph speed limit the answer, or should we consider the PSNI's preferred option of community buy-in?  However, I agree with comments made earlier that, if the PSNI can enforce the 30 mph speed limit, why can it not enforce the 20 mph speed limit, if you are swapping one for the other?  That is something that we need to examine.</p><p>In evidence from DRD, the issue of cost was raised, with a view that it could be anything from &#163;6 million to &#163;26 million, depending on what level it was implemented at and the different types of measures that would need to be put in place.  DRD's preferred approach would be to enable the introduction of reduced speed limits but not impose them.  There are questions around that as well.</p><p>The question that needs to be asked is this:  why was there such a lukewarm response from the PSNI at the Committee?  I accept what you are saying, by the way, but they were a bit less welcoming when speaking to us, especially over being able to enforce it.  Maybe, Mr Ramsey, you will look at that for us, as well as at DRD's approach of introducing but not enforcing it, which was another issue of concern.</p><p>Obviously, the cost implications are an issue.  Where is DRD going to get this money?  Maybe the Minister will tell us when he gets up to speak, because I know that money is tight.  If we go for the &#163;6 million approach, where will you get that money?  If you go for the full approach, where will you get &#163;26 million?  It has certainly been a struggle in recent Budgets.  This is a big issue that we need to look at.</p><p>I stress to Mr Ramsey that I am not knocking his Bill; I am taking it very seriously.  There are issues.  Saving lives and preventing injury is very important.  We all agree with that, which is why we need to consider the Bill seriously before we reach a conclusion.

It is a very sorry state of affairs and so much more than just regrettable.  I am aware that Northern Ireland differs from the rest of the UK in some ways, but what does not differ is that the Union flag is our national flag too.  It saddens me when we are continually made to feel that we are doing wrong by wanting to express our identity.  It is simply wrong that we are the only part of the UK that is treated differently and unfairly.</p><p>What we need to know is the truth behind the decision.  In the 'News Letter', the SDLP stated that it was that party that stopped the union flag being displayed on our driving licences.  However, in answer to a question for oral answer that I asked, the Environment Minister stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I thought I outlined quite clearly that this was not a decision taken by me.  I did not consult Executive colleagues:  driver licensing is a transferred matter for which the Department of the Environment is responsible.\" &#8212; [Official Report, Vol 101, No 2, p31, col 1].</p><p>The Minister is saying here that it is not him but his Department that is responsible.

I demand to know which is correct: the statement by your party that it was responsible or the statement made to me in response to my question for oral answer? Is it the UK Transport Minister?  You will have to outline what the facts are.</p><p>I also find it strange that, while the Minister also apparently asked the UK Transport Minister if it would be possible to provide individuals with an option to choose whether to include our flag, this was rejected for some reason. Where is the proof from your Department that you were looking at this?  Can you provide papers so that we can get to the bottom of the issue?

It is quite clear that this is one of the most interesting Westminster elections that we have seen in quite a while.  For the first time in a long time, people here can have a say in what type of British Government are formed, what type of policies they will follow and what impact that will have on us here.  We are all very good here at blaming the British when we run out of money, and we are very good at, rightly, recognising that the Tory cuts have been detrimental to our people and that the welfare cuts have had a very real and dangerous impact on the people of the North.  If we recognise that, we have to recognise that that is where the decisions are being made in relation to those key areas of budget and welfare.  The logical outworking of that is that we go there, as a starting point, and that we go there to maximise our influence to best serve the people of the North.  That is what the SDLP intends to do.  We want to join others in a kind of Celtic coalition to help lock David Cameron out of Downing Street.  I think that would be a good result.</p><p>We have heard people in the Chamber, people on protest rallies and people from trade unions talk about the impact that the Tory Government have had in the North, whether on the welfare system or on our block grant.  When we are offered the opportunity of an election in Westminster, whatever some of us might think about the fact that we, unfortunately, still have to go to there to represent our people, I think it is incumbent on all of us to take up that opportunity to put the case and get the best possible deal for people here.</p><p>The Tory Party has said that its very first act would be to reduce the benefit cap.  If that is going to be its first act, I worry very much about what its second, third, fourth and fifth acts will be.  I think that the potential Tory Government or Tory/UKIP Government, with, maybe, the DUP as well, are determined to reduce even further the welfare provisions for the most vulnerable; they are determined to reduce even further the pay and conditions for our public sector; and they are determined to reduce the size of government.  We all know what kind of an impact that will have here and on people in constituencies like my own that suffer unemployment issues and suffer as a result of bad government and bad politics.  We are determined to make our voice heard; I encourage other people to do the same.</p><p>I ask the DUP to make it clear that, if it is within its gift, it will not allow a Tory Government to do what they have been doing, multiplying the impact on the people here.  Equally, I ask Sinn F&#233;in to review its policy of abstentionism, because, if it is able to sit in here and D&#225;il &#201;ireann, how does that not apply to Westminster?  I understand that people can be abstentionist if they want, but I do not think that there is a consistent message in sitting in here while there is still no united Ireland.  I do not understand.  If there is a place that people need to be represented in, people need to go and do that representing.  We need to join with the other progressive forces across these islands in trying to prevent another Tory Government and trying to support a Labour Government that will do the right thing because we make sure that they do the right thing.  What we need to look for from the negotiations that, I think, will be inevitable after the Westminster election is a proper, better and fairer deal for the North.</p><p>What should the Barnett consequentials of the HS2 project look like if we get them?  Based on DFP's figures, it should be &#163;1&#183;3 billion for the North of Ireland.  Imagine the infrastructure development that we could put in place with &#163;1&#183;3 billion.  People talk about welfare all the time.  We need to tackle welfare dependency, and the best way to do that is to put people into work.  The way that you put people into work is by investing in infrastructure and skills.  We want a deal that ensures expanded university provision and expanded infrastructure investment right across the North, so that places like Derry can begin to properly contribute to the economy of the North, therefore reducing the welfare bill and leading to all the positive things that flow from that.  We would also like to see a city deal for Derry &#8212; my colleagues from other cities will allow me this indulgence &#8212; that will allow us to ring-fence funding and borrowing powers for people in Derry and to implement all those things that we would like to see happen.</p><p>I have another major worry about this election.  One of the potential Governments that are talked about is one made up of the Conservative Party, UKIP and potentially the DUP.  What would that end up with?  It would end up with there being a referendum on Britain's involvement in the European Union.  Does anybody in the House think that a British exit from the European Union would be good for Britain or here?  When we are sitting with a land border with another jurisdiction that is part of the European Union, I cannot understand how that would be a positive thing for the North of Ireland.  In fact, look at the direct funding that came from the EU between 2007 and 2013.  It was &#163;1&#183;3 billion in single farm payments; &#163;330 million through the Northern Ireland rural development fund; &#163;18 million through the European Fisheries Fund; &#163;180 million through Peace III; over &#163;300 million through the European regional development fund; &#163;165 million through the European social fund element; and &#163;77 million through INTERREG IV.  That is without even talking about the benefits from doing trade with other member states.  After this election, we are potentially looking at a Conservative/UKIP/DUP alliance that would allow for an exit from the European Union.  People in Northern Ireland should be very scared of that, and, in our view, the only way to stop it is to ensure that we have a Labour Government in Downing Street, one that have their feet held to the fire by progressive forces from the Celtic areas around here.</p><p>I am an Irish nationalist and I would love not to have to go to Westminster.  I would far rather go to our own national Parliament in Dublin, but the fact remains that power rests with Westminster, and, as democrats, we will go to Westminster to try to get the best possible deal for our people.  We will go to Westminster to try to lock David Cameron out of Downing Street and ensure a progressive alliance in the next British Government.  I hope that others will hear the call and join us in that fight.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Westminster Elections"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I ask the Minister for an update on the finalisation of the SPPS.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Environment: Wind Turbines: Planning Approval"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>T7.

That would be a positive step forward.  I hope that I am not reading too much into the lack of amendment of that part of the motion from the DUP.  We would all be grateful for confirmation of that.</p><p>The issue that has got all the media attention is the proposed conscience clause.  We have to be careful in the House about the messages that we send out to members of our community.  For a long time, people in our community who were described as LGBT had to hide who they were from their family, community and people in general.  I think that we have moved a long way from that.  I think that families in every community, regardless of religion or faith, have moved to understanding people's sexual orientation.  As a society, we have moved far forward in that regard.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Assembly has not moved quite as fast.  Perhaps that is understandable, but we need to begin to send out a different message &#8212; to send out a message to the man in Belfast whose house was attacked recently after his husband passed away that that sort of activity is not condoned by us.  That sort of activity should be left in the past where it belongs.  We should send out the message that we as legislators stand with minorities, regardless of what minority it is, against people who would bully or intimidate them out of their home or drive them towards suicide, which is a very real concern for many in our community.</p><p>I was very proud when I was mayor of our city to lead the first Foyle Pride march in Derry.

I want to read a passage first.  It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Newry and Mourne District Council failed to comply with its own Equality Scheme when deciding to retain the name 'The Raymond McCreesh Park' for a Council-owned children&#8217;s play park in Newry ... the Council&#8217;s consideration of the issue was 'more focussed on process and on maintaining the name of the play park than on paying due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity and regard to the desirability of promoting good relations.  There is little evidence that the duty was exercised in substance, with rigour and with an open mind in the decision making process.'\"</p><p>Those words are not mine but the words of the Equality Commission.</p><p>I listened to Mr Lunn and others criticise the Equality Commission, and rightly so.  I agree with them.  However, more recently, the Equality Commission has taken a more aggressive approach to this, and I hope that it will follow it through.  It has a responsibility to take action on it.  It realises that there have been shortcomings and that there has been almost purposeful intent against a community, a minority community in the area, and it is clear that it should take action.</p><p>I cannot understand why there is such a determination to cause more hurt and suffering to the victims of this society and their families.  Was it not bad enough that families had to suffer the callous and brutal murder of a loved one, unexpectedly never seeing that family member again alive, sometimes with many young children in the household?  They are now having their noses rubbed in it and are having that trauma re-established by the renaming or the naming of a play park or, indeed, any other facility after that terrorist.  I just cannot understand the mentality of people who want to do that and who want to carry that through.  Surely those individuals have suffered enough.</p><p>It has already been said that naming a children's play park after a terrorist goes that extra mile.  It makes it even more difficult when young people are the subject of this behaviour and that past behaviour.</p><p>I listened to the Sinn F&#233;in Members' aggressive attitude.  They were aggressive to most of us, including those on this side of the House and the SDLP.  I saw them turning their attention on many of us to try to divert attention away from the real subject.  They tried to divert attention away from their misdemeanours in this society over the last generation.  They tried to divert attention away from their misdemeanours, even in the naming of the Raymond McCreesh play park.  Why can they not just hold their hands up and say, \"Look, folks, we were wrong\"?</p><p>I have a warning for Members and for general society.  These are the people who we have heard talking about building consensus, who said that there should be no more majority rule and that we want to live in a reconciled society.  I have this warning for you people out there:  this is what it would be like under Sinn F&#233;in rule.

You would not have a say.  You would do as it does and do as it says.  That is exactly what it wants.</p><p>On the point of Raymond McCreesh, I have to say that he had a choice.  He had a choice whether to go on hunger strike and whether to live or die.  He chose to die.  Those people who were brutally murdered at Kingsmills and other areas did not have that choice.

I do not disagree that the Noble indices may have a part to play in it, but I can tell you from my experience in Fermanagh that I have met a number of childcare providers in recent weeks.  They have found that, because of new guidelines and procedures coming down from health agencies and the increased numbers of staff that they have to have in order to satisfy the criteria, they find it absolutely impossible to provide that level of staffing for the number of children who come onto their premises.  That means that they cannot provide affordable childcare.  If they have to raise their fees by &#163;2 per hour per child, it will leave some of those working parents unable to go out to work.  It would be much more cost-effective for them to stay at home and not take on that part-time or full-time job. There is a real issue there that needs to be looked at.  I have already found that on the ground in my constituency, Fermanagh and South Tyrone.</p><p>That leads me to the second negative aspect &#8212; if you want to look at it in that way &#8212; which is access to services in rural areas.  I recall doing a Consumer Council public transport challenge &#8212; it must have been seven or eight years ago &#8212; in which it was suggested that I make a series of appointments and use public transport to attend them.  As you will appreciate, there is no train service in County Fermanagh, so it was much more difficult, and I was limited in the public transport that I could use.  I found that you had to make appointments around the times of the bus or public transport service as opposed to getting the public transport to suit whatever time you had made the appointment.  You had to do the thing the opposite way around from how you would normally do it.  I found that a difficult challenge.</p><p>The third aspect is about working in isolation.  Working and living in isolation in the countryside can be a very lonely experience.  We all know how the farming community has suffered financially over the last number of years and what significant pressure it has been under.  That significant pressure can almost always be worse if you work in isolation, as many in the farming community do.  Mental health and suicide issues have been a major traumatic experience in rural communities, and I pay tribute to Rural Support for the work it carries out.  Also, when accidents happen, there is often nobody on hand to help.  Once you have had an accident, you are on your own, and you are left in isolation.  In the last few months, a farmer who lives close to me was attacked by his animals &#8212; or that is the thought &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Tackling Rural Poverty and Social Inclusion Framework"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>&#8212; and he was not found until the next morning.

Thirdly, I add my thanks to the Committee staff and the research teams who carried out much work for the project and the inquiry.</p><p>Before I get into the main aspects, I want to point out that living in rural areas in Northern Ireland is not all negative.  We should not look on everything as having a negative aspect, because there are some very good positives as well.  There are advantages, and many of us recognise that.  As there has been such a demand over recent years for people to live in the countryside, it proves that many people enjoy the countryside and the pleasures of living there.  However, there are many disadvantages.</p><p>I want to start off by talking about rural childcare, which was mentioned earlier, and, in particular, affordable rural childcare.  Childcare centres, especially those in rural areas where they do not have the numbers of children attending them, are under huge pressure, particularly in relation to some of the guidance and procedures that have come forward from the health agencies.  I ask the Minister to have a look at that at some stage.

Nonetheless, it is important that we put the strategy in place.  There are elements that we can begin to implement readily without a massive injection of resources.  In due course, we will need to look for resources to be made available.  I have identified the monitoring rounds and, perhaps, on a more sustainable basis, the budget for the year after this one for mainstream delivery of the project.  To be very clear:  this is an Executive Programme for Government commitment; it is not a tick-box exercise of publishing a strategy to sit on a shelf.  We are setting ourselves some very ambitious targets.  Having done that, we have to ensure that we provide the resources that will enable us to meet those targets; otherwise we will leave ourselves exposed to criticism.</p><p>Today, however, let us acknowledge that we have taken the step of publishing the strategy.  I stress again that this is the first time that this has occurred anywhere in these islands; this is a new departure and we are in unknown territory.  There will be ups and downs in the upcoming years; this will not be easy, but we know that it is inescapable.  We cannot have an economy with an economic inactivity level of around 27%; it is simply not sustainable.  We simply have to address the problem.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for her comments. Specifically on the community and voluntary sector, I can say that, particularly at this time, there is the impression that government and the community and voluntary sector are pushing and pulling in different directions, particularly on funding.  Right across the Executive, that is not the message that we want to get out.  The community and voluntary sector is a critical partner in the delivery of a range of services and in providing advice to government.  I see a strong role for the community and voluntary sector, particularly in the delivery of the strategy.</p><p>The Member mentioned the strategic forum, which is one immediate opportunity.  A lot of the different types of interventions will have to be devised in a community setting, and that is why the process of competitive piloting is so critical.  In due course, we expect to see calls for bids coming in from different actors in Northern Ireland, and there will be opportunities for the community and voluntary sector to make bids as part of that process in order to take forward, on a pilot basis, different types of interventions to see what works and what does not.  Government will then seek to upscale the types of interventions that have been proven to be most successful.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>The Member is right to stress two points, the first of which is the importance of ongoing scrutiny and management.  A number of the projects are very much geared towards those objectives, including ongoing data collection to assess how we are doing. He is also right to make the point that there are significant variations in levels of economic inactivity across Northern Ireland, and that is immediately stark, even at district council or parliamentary constituency level.  If you drill beneath that, the figures may well be even starker.  There are pockets in Northern Ireland where, if you combine economic inactivity levels with levels of unemployment, approximately one in two adults is not part of the labour market. That is a really shocking reality that we have to address.</p><p>The achievement of the objectives that we are setting in the strategy cannot be realised simply by going through the easier-to-reach groups and ticking boxes.  If we are to make a lasting difference to people and communities, we have to ensure that the range of projects and interventions runs across the board and that we have particular sensitivity to ensuring that we reach the hardest-to-reach groups, who, at the same time, want to engage in the world of work.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>The Member is right to highlight the issue.  Far too easily, we tend to write people off, whether they are older workers, people who have been made redundant in their late 40s or early 50s &#8212; we say, \"Well, that's them\" &#8212; or those with mental health issues.  Many people, particularly those with a mental health condition or other disability, are not restricted from engaging in the world of work, particularly if the relevant support and interventions are put in place to allow that to happen.  That is why the project is so important to seeking to address those barriers.  The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, for example, has specific responsibilities, particularly for mental health and disability issues, but all of us can be champions in changing the attitudes both of the companies receiving the workers and of the workers themselves, so that they have the self-esteem and self-confidence that they are worthwhile and able to make a competitive contribution in the labour market.</p><p>The Member also makes reference to resources, which &#8212; I have to be straight with the Member &#8212; are an ongoing challenge.  The Member, like others, is fully aware of the very tight public expenditure context in which we find ourselves.  There has been a successful bid to the change fund, which is a central Executive pot of money managed by DSD, that will allow us to take forward the control project.  I will see what resource I can find in my existing budget to allow my DEL responsibilities to be taken forward during the year, and other Ministers may approach it in a similar light.  Equally, we may need to look to monitoring round bids for specific programmes to allow us to begin implementation of the strategy.  I suggest that the bigger pressure point will come in the next financial year, 2016-17.   We will have to ensure as we strike the budget for that year that we mainstream the funds necessary. Ultimately, investment in this regard will create a return for individuals, society and the economy as a whole.  It is a worthwhile investment.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for his comments.  First of all, he is right that this is not about shifting people from one form of labour market classification to another but looking at the employment rate.  To crystallise this, a lot of people criticise the Conservative Government in the 1980s, when they had huge difficulties with unemployment, for simply shifting people off the unemployment rolls into economic inactivity, as opposed to getting them back to work.  In that way, the figures were perceived to have been somewhat rigged.  It is clear that, as an Executive, we want to be straight with people.  This is about the employment rate; that is the way we measure the success of the strategy.  Simply moving people from unemployment to economic inactivity or from one category of exclusion from the labour market to another is not addressing the problem.</p><p>In project D, which falls to my Department, there is a mix of interventions to encourage companies to take on people who are economically inactive.  One potential means is to expand the use of social clauses into new territory.  In the main, however, it will be a combination of investing in skills and financial incentives, and I suggest that one will not be successful without the other.  Employers will not hire someone simply on the basis of a wage incentive; they have to know that the person has the skills and capacity to do the job.  But employers are maybe prone not to take a risk with someone who is economically inactive, and that is where a wage subsidy becomes relevant. Obviously, wage subsidies carry a significant cost to the public purse.  We have used them, most recently to tackle youth unemployment as part of the youth employment scheme, and they have been successful in getting young people between 18 and 24 into the world of work.  An extension of that type of model to those who are economically inactive can be considered as part of the delivery of project D.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for his comments.  Again, this is an Executive strategy that is a product of many hands.  It has been taken forward by Minister Foster and me in partnership, and it is a classic example of how the Executive can work in a collaborative manner to produce outcomes for the people of Northern Ireland.  Delivery now falls to a range of Departments, as well.</p><p>The project that the Member referred to is essentially our control project.  That will be taken forward by the Department for Social Development, and it has been the subject of a successful bid to the Executive's part of the budget via the change fund.  It is for Minister Storey to take forward that project in detail.  I know that he is very conscious of that and, in doing that, will want to be very mindful of the areas in Northern Ireland where economic inactivity is most acute.  The Member mentioned the north-west, and a delegation from the Derry area had a meeting with a number of Ministers to make that point and to work up a detailed proposal.</p><p>There will need to be further co-design work with the relevant people to take that project forward, but it is my understanding that that initial control project should run from the autumn to March 2016.  We will then see a mainstream competitive piloting process being taken forward during the 2016-17 financial year.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I want to say a number of things to Mr Allister.  He may wish to say that we have had devolution for eight years and that we are only now getting this.  However, we have it, and this is the first time that any region in the UK has sought to undertake such an undertaking.  I am not aware of any comments from Mr Allister over the intervening eight years demanding that the Executive should produce such a strategy.  Indeed, Executive Ministers determined that it was a priority, and it was inserted into the Programme for Government to recognise its importance.</p><p>The second thing that I would say is that I do not think that it is helpful or accurate to use the term \"work-shy\" to refer to those who are economically inactive.  I and my colleagues are working on the basis that there are people in our society who want to work but who are being held back by various barriers or stigmas that prevent them from doing so.  This strategy is quite clearly based around empowering people to go back into work.  It is not about compulsion.</p><p>This is not linked to welfare reform.  If welfare reform had not been devised by the outgoing coalition Government, we would still have regarded economic inactivity as a major structural problem within Northern Ireland's economy, and the Executive would have sought to address it.  Welfare reform is obviously part of the landscape out there that the strategy will need to take into account when it is being delivered, but it stands on its own merits and is not based on compulsion.  It is about empowering people to make choices for them that create better opportunities and self-esteem and produce better outcomes for our economy in terms of increased economic participation.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I thank the Chair of my Committee for his comments.  Again, I stress that this is a strategy that will be reported in greater detail to both of the Committees scrutinising the two lead Departments.</p><p>I stress to the Member and the House the unprecedented nature of the undertaking that we are making.  This has been a problem in Northern Ireland for the best part of 30 years.  It has defied the ups and downs of the economic cycle, so we know that it is a structural problem within our economy, but it is also one that we have to address if we are to make the most of the people whom we are there to serve and the wider economy.</p><p>We also have to recognise that this is the first time there has been anything like this in any jurisdiction in these islands.  This is innovative policymaking in its rawest sense.  This is a great advertisement for the benefits of devolution:  this would not be happening if we did not have a devolved Executive and Assembly that have the interests of the economy at heart and have the means to take forward innovative strategies.</p><p>In saying all that, we recognise that this is not going to be easy.  This is an inescapable pressure that we have a fundamental duty to address.  It is going to take a lot of work from a lot of the people, in government and beyond government, to achieve the targets that we are setting.  We believe that the targets, contrary to what the Chair said, are incredibly ambitious.  We are seeking to get above 70% by 2020 and to get above the UK average, which is 73%, by 2030.  Even achieving a 1% move will be incredibly difficult.  To put it in context, achieving the target by 2020 will involve the creation of about 58,000 jobs, and potentially 115,000 new jobs will be needed to get to the 2030 target.</p><p>Of course, this strategy should not be viewed in isolation of other efforts that the Executive have taken forward to address the economy.  There are many other good things that we are doing.  The Member will be well aware of the record results that Invest Northern Ireland had last year.  We are aware of the efforts that are being made to attract a lower level of corporation tax to Northern Ireland and the jobs potential that will flow from that.  So, with all the levers being geared towards improving the economy, it is also important that, within that context, we have specific measures to address the barriers faced by those who are economically inactive.  It is in that context that this strategy is most relevant.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for his comments.  He will be aware that we have set an interim target in relation to 2020 of having 70%.  It is the clear intention that this strategy will be refreshed on several occasions as we move towards 2030, and I have no doubt that a further interim target of 2025 will be considered as part of that process.  It will involve a lot of work and mobilisation of people to achieve those targets.</p><p>It is also worth stressing that the European Commission has a target of achieving 75% economic participation by 2020, so we are part of a wider movement across the European Union to improve participation.  In that context, we can take some degree of comfort in that, while we see some very high performing economies, particularly in northern Europe, there are many other economies in southern and eastern Europe where the economic participation level is lower than that in Northern Ireland.  This is a phenomenon that is a problem elsewhere, and we can derive lessons from that, but there are, no doubt, some very particular circumstances in Northern Ireland that we need to be very mindful of.  Again, the strategy is here to address those.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>Let me say two things on that.  First of all, the childcare strategy is the responsibility of OFMDFM.</p><p>Nonetheless, there will be read across with what we are doing.  With the competitive piloting process, we will be looking for projects coming forward, and, as we seek to address issues about those with family commitments being excluded from the labour market, childcare will be a key focus.  I have no doubt that projects will come forward, and the whole nature of the competitive piloting is to try as many things as possible to ensure that that is the case.</p><p>The Member also referred to the urban/rural split, and I can reassure her about that.  We are not suggesting a one-size-fits-all approach across Northern Ireland or, indeed, one that derives from an urban perspective.  It is a bottom-up focus.  We know that that is the way that this will be most effective, so we will seek a range of projects coming forward, and I have no doubt that a good balance of those projects will come from rural communities as much as from urban areas.  As the Member well knows, there are major differences in the barriers that people will face.</p><p>I apologise to Mr Buchanan because he referred to voluntary participation and how we encourage that.  We accept that a large number of people who are economically inactive will not be able to engage in the labour market.  That is accepted and acknowledged.  However, the strategy is based on the presumption that there are people who want to engage in the world of work but that there are barriers that prevent them from doing so.  As the Member outlined, childcare is a key example.  We are trying to enable people to take that step into the world of work, which is not only more productive for them and their self-esteem but better for the economy.  We have to address the reasons why they are not able to make that leap.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for his questions and acknowledge his role as the Chair of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and his particular responsibilities in this regard.

We know that, if we are able to address barriers that are perhaps particular to Northern Ireland, we should be in a situation in which we can be on a par with or, indeed, exceeding what is happening in other jurisdictions.</p><p>This process has been devised through significant engagement with stakeholders, including a public consultation, and carers have had an opportunity to be part of that process.  That is not the end of the engagement with stakeholders, and, if anything, we will now be changing gears.  As we take the projects forward, we want to engage with those who have the most direct say in how we design the process by which we can overcome the barriers.  For an organisation such as Carers NI, there may be opportunities with the competitive piloting process on devising projects.

This joint statement has been agreed with my partner in that regard, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p><p>To reflect the need to develop a holistic approach to tackling economic inactivity, the strategy has also been developed in close partnership with other Departments, including, in particular, the Department for Social Development, Invest Northern Ireland and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank those Departments for their valuable role in the development of the strategy and for their continued cooperation as we move forward through the implementation process.</p><p>I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the many stakeholders for their invaluable insights and contributions throughout the development of the strategy.  The strategic proposals were rigorously tested during the consultation period by a wide range of stakeholders, and I am delighted that a number of new innovative ideas and approaches were identified through the consultation and have been incorporated into the strategy.</p><p>Economic inactivity is a labour market classification referring to individuals who are neither in work nor actively seeking work.  High rates of economic inactivity have been a feature of the Northern Ireland economy for decades.  The current rate of economic inactivity in Northern Ireland is 26&#183;8%, which equates to approximately 312,000 adults between the ages of 16 and 64 who are not engaged with the labour market.  This is the highest rate across all the regions of the United Kingdom and compares to a UK average of 22&#183;1%.  This level of economic inactivity has been a persistent feature of our economy over the past 30 years, within the ranges of 26% to 32%, irrespective of the changes in the economic cycle.  I am sure that Members will agree that the figures outline the stark scale of the problem.</p><p>High levels of economic inactivity represent a major structural problem in our economy, which, if unaddressed, would limit our ability to develop and transform our economic prospects.  For that reason, our two Departments have been leading, on behalf of the Executive, on the development of a new strategy aimed at tackling economic inactivity in Northern Ireland.  It will be the only dedicated government strategy in the UK at a national level aimed at tackling economic inactivity.</p><p>The strategy has been informed by an extensive research, development and consultation process, including a baseline study of the profile of economic inactivity in Northern Ireland; an independent literature review carried out by Edinburgh Napier University; a strategic framework document; a 12-week public consultation exercise; engagement with the local business sector; independent focus groups with people from a range of economically inactive groups; regular engagement with the Committee for Employment and Learning and the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment; and regular engagement with the Executive subcommittee on the economy, including its endorsement of a wide range of strategic proposals that have been included in the strategy.  The outcomes from the comprehensive development process informed a final strategy that was agreed by the Executive on 16 April.</p><p>It may be helpful if I take some time to outline the key elements of the strategy and how we plan to implement them.  The strategy makes a clear distinction between the different categories of economic inactivity:  from benign forms of inactivity, such as students or early retirees, through to other forms of inactivity, such as severe health conditions or disabilities that cannot be addressed through any government intervention.  The focus of the strategy is, therefore, on the forms of economic inactivity that are caused when an individual&#8217;s particular personal circumstances, often combined with various structural issues, geographical nuances and economic conditions, restrict their access to the labour market.</p><p>The strategy will focus on three key economically inactive groups:  people with work-limiting health conditions or disabilities who are included within the wider long-term sick and disabled category and who, with the right level of support and reasonable accommodations from an employer, should be able to work; and lone parents and carers who are included within the wider family commitments category, who are currently in receipt of out-of-work benefits and would be better off in work but are unable to make the transition due to a lack of appropriate support or opportunities.</p><p>Recent social security statistics show that the total for the three target groups is approximately 64,000, which equates to approximately 40% of all social security claimants in the economically inactive groups and approximately 20% of the total working-age economic inactivity figure in Northern Ireland.  In saying that, we fully recognise that not every person who falls into these categories will be in a position to engage with the labour market or will wish to do so.  I think that it is, therefore, important to highlight the person-centred ethos of the strategy and to confirm that the strategy will be based on voluntary participation.  The strategy will be about supporting people to make transitions when they opt to do so.  This is not about compulsion.</p><p>The strategy seeks, by 2030, to contribute towards a stable and competitive employment rate in Northern Ireland, which exceeds the UK average, through a reduction in the proportion of the working-age population classified as economically inactive.  An interim strategic goal of achieving an employment rate of more than 70% by 2020 has also been included in order to assess the effectiveness of the strategy at a mid-point in the implementation process.</p><p>To put this in context, the current employment rate in Northern Ireland is 68&#183;6% compared with a UK average of 73&#183;4%.  Achieving that goal will, therefore, be hugely challenging, but we are firmly of the opinion that we must aspire to put Northern Ireland's economic competitiveness on a level footing with that of the rest of the UK.  It is worth stressing that our focus is on the overall employment rate, as opposed to a stand-alone reduction in the economic inactivity rate.  We are not interested in reducing economic inactivity simply through shifting people into the unemployment category or by moving them from unemployment into inactivity.</p><p>Whilst our future actions will take into account the changing landscape arising from welfare reform, they are not part of the current proposed changes to the welfare reform system nor are they motivated by them.  Rather, our response is directed at addressing what has become a long-term structural problem within our economy.</p><p>Successfully achieving the strategic goal will require the fulfilment of three strategic objectives.  The first is to reduce by 2030, through transitions into employment, the levels of economic inactivity due to work-limiting health conditions or disabilities by a 25% reduction in the number of people claiming employment and support allowance within the work-related activity group against the 2015 baseline position.  The second objective is to reduce by 2030, through transitions into employment, the levels of economic inactivity due to family commitments through a 25% reduction in the number of lone parents and carers claiming income support against the 2015 baseline position.  The third objective is to establish by March 2017 a robust baseline for the numbers of people moving from work into economic inactivity due to health-related issues and to reduce by 2030 the baseline figure by 20% through a reduction in the number of new claims to relevant health-related social security benefits.</p><p>It is recognised that any potential future changes to the social security system in Northern Ireland may have implications for these strategic objectives through the scope, nature and claimant count of any new or revised social security benefits.  It is, therefore, proposed to review and refresh the strategy on a regular basis to ensure that any necessary changes are appropriately reflected.</p><p>The strategic approach is based on a model of holistic intervention that is centred around six key themes.  Theme one is about improving engagement and support by seeking to encourage and facilitate labour market transitions and improving employment outcomes for people in the target groups through an innovative outcomes-focused competitive pilot testing model.  Theme two is about increasing employment opportunities and seeking to stimulate job creation through the development of a new model of incentives and supporting people in the target groups to make the transition towards and into the labour market.  Theme three will address wider barriers by seeking to challenge and change societal attitudes towards disadvantaged groups in the labour market and by helping to improve employment outcomes for older workers and people with mental health issues.  Theme four is about breaking the cycle of inactivity, and it seeks to reduce future inflows to economic inactivity through preventative interventions aimed at improving health and work outcomes.  It also seeks to promote positive life choices amongst young people who are at risk of disengaging with education, employment or training and of potentially becoming economically inactive in the future.  Theme five relates to partnership, and strategic management seeks to create effective management structures to deliver, coordinate and monitor the strategy&#8217;s implementation.  Theme six is about improving information, and it seeks to develop a robust information base and effective data management systems to improve the effective delivery and monitoring of the strategy&#8217;s implementation and management.</p><p>Each of the six themes will be implemented through a series of 11 projects delivered across a number of Departments.  I will now briefly outline the projects.</p><p>Project A is the co-design development of an outcomes framework to inform and guide the pilot testing process.  DEL will take that project forward.</p><p>In project B, an innovative regime of competitive pilot project testing using a pre-commercial procurement-based model will be developed to allow a number of small-scale initiatives to be tested for their potential to improve outcomes for the target groups.  Successful approaches will be developed further and potentially upscaled.  DEL and DETI will take that project forward.</p><p>Through project C, a geographically focused control group project will be developed, delivered and evaluated to provide benchmarking data for the competitive pilot testing phase.  DSD will take that project forward.</p><p>Under project D, a new model of support and incentives will be developed to encourage employers to hire and upskill people from the target groups and to promote sustainable employment.  DEL will take that project forward.</p><p>Under project E, new and improved measures will be put in place to promote the financial advantages of employment, raise awareness of transitional benefits protections and better communicate the linking rules to reclaim benefits to encourage labour market transitions among the target groups.  This project will be taken forward by DSD.</p><p>Through project F, new measures will be put in place to address wider labour barriers faced by older workers.  These will include an age-positive public awareness campaign to highlight the benefits of employing older workers and promote age-positive recruitment practices.  This project will be taken forward by DEL.</p><p>Through project G, new measures will be put in place to tackle mental health stigma in the workplace.  These will include a mental health promotion strategy aimed at encouraging positive mental health through work and in the workplace, as well as initiatives to support employers to foster mental health friendly workplaces.  This project will be taken forward by DHSSPS.</p><p>Through project H, an expert panel will be appointed to undertake a Northern Ireland scoping study of the health and work recommendations from Dame Carol Black's report 'Working for a healthier tomorrow' and identify and explore the feasibility of options to better integrate health and work services in Northern Ireland.  Again, this project will be taken forward by DHSSPS.</p><p>Under project I, a series of regional younger people's advocates will be appointed to engage with young people who are at risk of disengaging with education, employment or training and potentially becoming economically inactive.  The advocates will help to inspire and support positive life choices among the young people.  This project will be taken forward by DEL.</p><p>Project J will establish a strategic forum based on a partnership comprising employers, the voluntary and community sector, central and local government, the health-care sector, relevant statutory and non-departmental public bodies and expert advisers to provide strategic oversight, leadership and guidance.  This project will be taken forward by DETI.</p><p>Under project K, a series of research projects will be undertaken to identify new sources of data to inform the implementation process and accurately monitor the progress of the target groups towards and into employment, in line with the strategic objectives.  This project will be taken forward by DEL and DSD.</p><p>The strategy has been developed in the context of constrained public expenditure.  For that reason, a number of projects will initially be piloted to ensure that effective solutions are identified prior to the upscaling of investment.  A number of other projects will initially focus on feasibility and scoping exercises to provide modelling to inform the viability, cost and benefits of implementation.  Additional resources will have to be identified across Departments to ensure the successful implementation of the strategy going forward.</p><p>The development of a strategy to underpin these efforts is an unprecedented action by the Executive, and I cannot overemphasise that there is no quick-fix solution.  Efforts to address the multitude of complex factors and barriers that fuel the high rate of economic inactivity in Northern Ireland must be not only innovative but incrementally progressive to ensure that sustainable results are achieved.</p><p>We have a duty to do everything we can to help and support people to meet their full potential for the benefit of the individual through the positive factors associated with sustained employment and for the benefit of Northern Ireland in the economic and social advantages of having a more buoyant and competitive labour market.</p><p>Sustainable results cannot be delivered by government alone.  We must coordinate the efforts of all key sectors and stakeholders to maximise the outcomes for those most in need of our support.  In doing so, I am hopeful that the strategy will provide a long-term framework for greater economic participation in Northern Ireland.  The challenge now is one of delivery.  Through collaboration and partnerships, we are confident that sustainable change can be achieved.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statement: Enabling Success: Supporting the Transition from Economic Inactivity to Employment"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>Assured Skills has been an outstanding success and can be viewed as almost a unique contribution to the approach to inward investment relative to different approaches that are taken around the world.

It is important that businesses are in the driving seat in creating fresh opportunities.  It is not about the state trying to second-guess where apprenticeships should be created but about companies identifying their future training requirements. The real challenge is to ensure that we can keep up with and meet the expectations of businesses and that we do more to encourage our young people to consider apprenticeships as a legitimate pathway that is on a par with some of the more traditional pathways, such as university.

It proposes a referendum on EU membership without any consideration of the potential impacts on this part of Ireland.  In my view &#8212; it is one that is widely held across society here &#8212; exiting the European Union would have a considerably negative impact on our society and particularly on our economy.</p><p>We have a different relationship with Europe from that of people in parts of England, but, unfortunately, their agenda is driving the discussion.  We share an economy with the rest of Ireland, and this island has done very well through membership of the European Union.  In the event of a referendum on EU membership, we want to see a provision included that, if the people in this part of Ireland vote against leaving Europe, that mandate should be respected and the people here should not be dragged out of Europe against our wishes. I know from being out and about meeting people from all backgrounds, business owners and employees that people do not want to see this place taken out of Europe.  Most people see the positive impact that being part of the European Union has had on our economy, and they want to see that sustained in the future. Europe has a positive impact on our local economy in many ways.  Both jobs Ministers on the island promote it as a gateway to Europe, particularly for American investors and those looking to come into Europe for the first time.  Are we to believe that even the threat of a referendum on exiting Europe would not have a chilling effect on those potential investors?</p><p>The agriculture sector is heavily reliant on EU funding to help it exist, and groups involved in building peace across the North and along the border are heavily reliant on EU Peace funding.  I certainly do not believe that any future British Government would simply replace those funds with money from the British Treasury in the event of a withdrawal from Europe.  It is important that we quantify the extent of those funds.  Between 2007 and 2013 the North drew down &#163;2&#183;4 billion in EU funding.  That funding stream would be put at risk if we were to be pulled out of Europe.</p><p>Our economic output could be reduced by 3% or &#163;1 billion a year, if we were to be taken out of Europe.  Work carried out for the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment by Dr Leslie Budd put that figure on it.  He went further and said that cross-border transaction costs could \"rise significantly\" and that those would \"act as a disincentive\" to economic cooperation on the island of Ireland.  What we need to see on this island is closer economic cooperation, not the introduction of formalised border crossings and the erection of more barriers to trade.</p><p>The views of right-wing, xenophobic political parties in England should not be allowed to drive the agenda in the Westminster election, particularly on our future place in Europe.  The voices of people here need to be heard.  For me, there is a very clear choice for voters between the politicians who want to remain in Europe and those who are hitching their wagon to parties that want to drag us out of it.  That is the choice that people have to make.</p><p>I find it completely unacceptable that the British Prime Minister and the leaders of both main unionist parties advocate a referendum on future EU membership but actively oppose a referendum on whether Ireland should be united.

In doing so, they demonstrated huge strength in dealing with their tragic loss, but parents and families should not be forced into making that decision.  I say this to the Minister and his Executive colleagues:  let one of Oisin's many legacies be the introduction of opt-out organ donation legislation.  I support the introduction of such legislation.

I welcome the opportunity to speak in the Budget debate and the agreement that was finally reached on the Budget.  It is not an easy Budget.  We certainly have a difficult task ahead in protecting public services.  It is quite clear that we have received no gifts from those who are trying to drive our agenda in London.</p><p>The task of balancing our books, tackling inequality and driving economic growth has to be to the fore of our minds as we move forward.  Tackling inequality starts with the economy and how we deliver public services.  It starts with supporting businesses and creating sustainable employment, ensuring that people have access to a decent job and wage.  The Budget prioritises education, skills and development, job creation and growing the economy.  Growing the economy and tackling disadvantage was the number one priority of the 2011-15 Programme for Government, and this Budget follows on very much in that guise.</p><p>The final Budget makes additional allocations of more than &#163;150 million.  It prioritises Health and Education.  The final Budget sees DEL receiving a total of &#163;33&#183;2 million in additional funding.  DETI will receive &#163;3 million, which will go to Invest NI, as well as over &#163;7 million in the change fund allocation.  It must be remembered that all that has been agreed against the backdrop of an austerity agenda from Westminster.</p><p>We want to build a society that protects our environment and promotes the life chances of every child, young person and adult in the North to ensure that they have the opportunities to fulfil their potential and develop their talents.  Few, if any, countries in the world have the economic potential that we have here in Ireland, North or South.  We have a talented and skilled workforce, world-leading universities and a modern college sector.  We have a strong international reputation for producing quality goods and services, with notable successes in sectors such as food and drink, the creative industries, life sciences and modern manufacturing.</p><p>With the limited devolved powers that we have, our economic performance is improving, but far too many people still feel that they have to leave each year to get a job or further their career.  Of course, some people will always want to travel and work elsewhere, but that must be a choice, not a requisite for those looking to succeed.  I was looking through the latest spreadsheet from an Cumann L&#250;thchleas Gael, the GAA, on the number of people who have transferred out of their home club, and it is quite clear that emigration still presents a deeply worrying problem in rural communities.  The number of young men and women who are transferring from clubs in rural parts of Ireland to England, Australia and America is a deeply worrying trend.  We need to make sure that there are proper jobs and a well-built society for those people to return to.</p><p>With greater fiscal powers, our economic policy would be tailored precisely to our own needs to create jobs here and to tackle the barriers to employment by exerting control over tax, welfare and National Insurance. We would want to see improvements in productivity, employment and population.  That would lead to additional tax revenues, which would help close the fiscal gap that we hear so much about.</p><p>Together we must put every effort into developing a more sustainable and balanced economy, and that means driving investment in science, innovation, skills and infrastructure, while encouraging a more enterprising and entrepreneurial culture. Our IT sector and professional business services show particularly strong growth, and we must build and capitalise on this.  Invest NI does great work in promoting and creating jobs, but much more is required if we are to tackle regional disparities, as that is, after all, a Programme for Government commitment.</p><p>Recent figures I have obtained for job creation show that Invest NI helped to create over 2,000 jobs in Belfast but only small numbers in areas west of the Bann during 2013-14.  There is a direct link between the number of visits by foreign investors to a given area and the number of projects and jobs that are located in that area.  It is therefore extremely disappointing to me that so few visits take place to places like Fermanagh on an annual basis.  We all know and are told ad nauseam, that you cannot force an investor to locate in a particular area.  I might not agree with the principle, but I acknowledge that that reality exists. However, there is absolutely nothing stopping Invest NI using its substantial budget to better direct investors into areas west of the Bann that have been neglected since partition.</p><p>Everyone who comes to my county of Fermanagh falls in love with the place, and why wouldn't they? It is one of the most beautiful counties in the whole of Ireland.  We have a great deal to offer visitors but also potential investors.  Fermanagh has a highly educated, vibrant and hard-working population, with plenty of young people looking for employment opportunities.  We have excellent schools spread across the county that help to produce a skilled workforce, which could attract investors if places west of the Bann were promoted effectively.</p><p>Fermanagh also provides a good work/life balance for people, with good opportunities for social and cultural expression.  These are the types of positives that should be promoted about Fermanagh, but Invest NI will not give potential investors the chance to fall in love with the place.  It should be using its substantial budget to incentivise investors into neglected areas.  However, during 2013-14, the year in which &#163;92 million was wasted hosting the G8, only three potential investors were brought to Fermanagh.  Despite all the lofty promises that were made in advance of the G8, none of them has materialised.  We got new paint on our bollards in Enniskillen, some temporary mobile phone masts were erected to facilitate those who were coming, and many run-down shops were given false fronts to present Fermanagh as a thriving county.  The mobile phone masts have been removed, the paint on the bollards is chipping, and the closed shops remain closed.</p><p>Invest NI is failing Fermanagh.  It has been given a substantial budget, year after year, but most of us west of the Bann speak out in a unified voice to say that we are not getting our fair share of investment.  There are some dissenting voices to those remarks, but they do not stand up to scrutiny when you look at the facts.  Growing a sustainable and balanced regional economy must become a political and social priority.  It was a Programme for Government commitment, but some of the parties involved in this commitment seem to pick and choose which commitments they support at any given time.</p><p>The policies of the British Government are working for too few and denying opportunities to too many.  We should not merely adopt their policies.  Britain is highly imbalanced, and regional inequalities have grown alongside social inequalities.  Britain now has the highest levels of inequality of anyplace in the EU.  If we are to address this, we need to work together connectedly.  We need to create an education and training environment that will equip our young people to fulfil their potential and maximise the opportunities for island-wide education and training.</p><p>We need to gain control of the tax system so that we can simplify it, close poverty gaps, create a progressive tax system, remove barriers to business development and maximise the opportunities from the island economy.  We need to develop employment policy to bring together employers and unions to boost workforce participation and increase skills and productivity.  Boosting our productivity by just 1% would create thousands of jobs in the long term and generate substantial tax revenue.</p><p>We need to address the scandalously uncompetitive price of energy for our manufacturing companies.  We must tailor policy to boost key job-creating sectors in which the North has an international comparative advantage, such as in renewable energy and the agrifood sector.  We need to reindustrialise the North and, indeed, the island as a whole.  Our combined focus must be on strengthening manufacturing, promoting innovation and encouraging international trade and development.  We cannot simply tell everybody to get a degree in computer programming and move to Belfast.  That is not building a sustainable economy.</p><p>We must boost our infrastructure and transport networks.  We cannot repair and rebuild our economy and our public services without maximising the returns for all our citizens, building sustainable employment opportunities across the North and the island as a whole and ending regional disparities, and job creation is central to this.</p><p>Our wider economy is too heavily focused and reliant on consumer spending, which is often driven by consumer debt, funded by extortionate payday loans and high-interest credit cards.  Such economic drivers need to be adjusted, and we need to move to a more sustainable economic driver.</p><p>What are the priorities as I see them for Fermanagh in the coming period?  I know that the Minister for Employment and Learning is working on a capital build for a new rural university on the site of the old Erne Hospital in Enniskillen.  Anybody who visits Enniskillen now will see that most of that site has been cleared.  There is a huge opportunity there for a shared services site on which we can have a range of public-sector services all located in the one place instead of, as some Ministers are trying to do, moving them to Omagh or Dungannon.  There is scope there for the likes of a library, the jobs and benefits office and the Housing Executive to co-locate along with the further education college in Enniskillen.  That would provide synergies for delivering public services and help to regenerate a part of Enniskillen.</p><p>The DEL budget has been given a considerable uplift from the draft Budget to the final Budget, but I have serious questions about how that has been used.</p><p>It is quite common for us to attack the Minister, but we might excuse him for this one.</p><p>Queen's has implemented a serious cut to the students' union and the student support mechanisms that it offers, yet there has been absolutely no mention of addressing the salary of the vice chancellor, who earns &#163;250,000 a year and gets a house, a car and probably a driver.  He also has a wine budget, but it is more important to cut somebody working for the students' union than to try to address those issues.  Those are the types of solution that we want our universities to work towards.  Instead of hammering students by campaigning on the radio for an increase in tuition fees, they should be looking at where substantial savings can be made closer to home without having an impact on front-line services.</p><p>The hospital in Enniskillen is constantly promoted as one of the great things that the Executive delivered in recent years, and it certainly is, but there are problems with it, too.  We have simply built a hospital that may well become a white elephant unless adequate services and investment are put into it.  The hospital needs an investment of between &#163;1 million and &#163;1&#183;5 million to protect maternity services, which are under threat.  At present, any expectant mother with an elevated BMI or diabetes is encouraged to go to Derry to give birth.  That has to change.  It is not good enough to tell mothers that they have to drive an hour and a half from home to have a child.</p><p>There are certainly enough people in Fermanagh, Tyrone, south Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Sligo and Monagahan to justify a fully functional maternity services unit in the Enniskillen hospital.  We need investment in staff at the hospital to meet the standards in the 2012 maternity strategy.  We need ST3-level resident cover in obstetrics, paediatrics and anaesthetics, as well as compliance with the review of paediatric health-care services in hospitals and the community.  To do that, the paediatric resident on-call medical staff have to be at ST4-level or above.  So, this investment has to be a priority.  It has been sitting with the Department, the Public Health Agency and the Western Health and Social Care Trust for a considerable time.  I encourage the Health Minister to put that investment into Enniskillen hospital at the earliest opportunity and to retain and expand maternity services there.</p><p>In wider terms, we are missing a significant opportunity in Fermanagh.  More people from across the border availed themselves of services in the old Erne Hospital than use the current hospital.  I cannot get my head around that because coupled with that has been the reduction of services in hospitals adjacent to the border in the South.  Common sense tells you that more people would try to use a hospital near to them, so why have we not increased the number of people crossing the border to use our world-class hospital, as the Health Minister would, rightly, describe it?  There needs to be a focus on attracting patients from the South.  There were problems with the availability of insurance cover in the old hospital, but it is my understanding that all of those have been sorted out.</p><p>An increase in patient numbers would bring increased revenue for the Western Trust.  It would also allow for services to be expanded in the hospital because clinical professionals would be able to build up more hours and deliver more services locally instead of people having to travel to Craigavon, Belfast or Derry for a routine clinic appointment.  As far as I can remember, the logic for building the hospital in Enniskillen was the opportunity that it offered for patient cross-border mobility.  Effective cross-border planning for our hospital is not happening yet, but there is still time.</p><p>In Fermanagh, people wait for up to two years for a routine hip or other orthopaedic operation.  That is simply unacceptable.  The amount of money that the Western Health and Social Care Trust, and probably the other trusts, spend on managing pain and providing often inadequate home-help provision for people stranded in their beds because there is such a lengthy waiting list for hip operations makes no sense to me.  It does not make financial sense, and it certainly does not make social sense that you leave somebody lying there for two years, taking a wide range of pain management medication daily.</p><p>We have been told that the Health Department is implementing Transforming Your Care and invest to save in the long term.  I do not see that strategic approach being implemented by some of our overpaid managers, who have amassed over &#163;1 million in pension pots and earn colossal salaries every year.  All the while, front-line staff, many of whom are paid below the living wage, have a claim for a very basic pay increase to meet inflationary demands rejected.  That two-tier payment policy in the health service is not acceptable, and it needs to change.</p><p>In closing &#8212; I am kind of getting there &#8212; the Budget that we have agreed is not the Budget that we would all have wanted if we were starting from a blank canvas, but we must remember that we do not have the full range of fiscal powers to make the changes that we need to see here.  Nobody got everything that was wanted out of the Budget, but the parties that are speaking against it and that may vote against the Bill do so without offering any alternative.  To be fair to the Alliance Party, it proposed some alternatives, including an increase in tuition fees and the introduction of regressive water charges.  Thankfully, the Executive have decided not to introduce those measures, and that will be the case as long as we are about.</p><p>Finally, I want to give the Minister something that he can address by touching on the impact of rates on businesses across the North.  RPA has had a negative impact in some areas, and nowhere more so than in Fermanagh.  However, the &#163;30 million in rates conversions that he and his colleagues introduced have significantly softened the blow and reduced considerably any potential rates increase that domestic householders and businesses in Fermanagh face.</p><p>However, in the revaluation of non-domestic rates, which was recently announced, there were always going to be winners and losers.  That is just the nature of a rates revaluation, but it is my belief that the rates system is unfit for purpose.  It does not give any consideration to the level of profit that an organisation makes, which is unfair.  Simply to take the estimated rental value of a building over a year and set that as the rates bill is not a good approach.  We have businesses from completely different sectors paying the same rates, which is deeply unfair.  There is a small restaurant and guest house in Belcoo that pays the same rates as a commercial bank on High Street in Enniskillen.  I have spoken about that bank before, because it keeps charging me &#163;42 a go in unauthorised overdraft fees.  I will tell you this, though:  the bread that I buy out of that restaurant is very nice, and I will not have anything bad said about it.</p><p>Such an approach is regressive and does not support our business sector.  It is deeply unfair, and I implore the Minister to give some consideration to changing completely how rates here are calculated so that they are not solely based on the property that a business occupies and at least take some consideration of the level of profit that a business can make.  If the Minister will oblige and is willing to grant me more time to bend his ear, I have put in a request for him to meet me and a number of business organisations.</p><p>I will leave it at that, in the hope that we get out of here at some stage this evening.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Budget Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-11", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for giving way.

I was told directly by a former Northern Ireland Office Minister that prison reform was left in the \"too difficult\" tray under direct rule and was left for devolution to happen.  The good work done by the prison reform team, Dame Anne Owers and her colleagues, undoubtedly produced an excellent report.  Allowing for the fact that there were some political disagreements in this place as to exactly how some aspects of it would be implemented, it has nonetheless formed the basis of a very significant reform from the culture in which the Prison Service was effectively given the job of guarding the perimeter of the prisons to one in which we now see very positive work going on.</p><p>This is the sort of work that I saw highlighted in the Ornella unit in Ash House recently and the additional work assisting women to get their lives back on track; the work that has turned the young offenders' centre into a college; the work that has got the good result that we highlighted earlier for Magilligan; and the ongoing work in the very difficult and complex prison of Maghaberry to ensure that life is much better there.

Not only that; we have to pay wind generators capacity payments for being there even though they are not always there and even though, sometimes, they cannot run.  Sometimes, then, because of the state of our grid and because it cannot take their energy, we have to pay them constraint charges.  That is the reason why we have to get this mix right.

The commissioner listed the main types of abuse of the elderly as physical, emotional, sexual or financial abuse and neglect.  Her proposal for an Act of the Assembly &#8212; an adult safeguarding Bill &#8212; is one that I believe would find widespread support in the Chamber.  As of June 2014, abuse referrals in Northern Ireland had risen by 76% in three years. Clearly, there is a good reason to legislate. Older people in Northern Ireland who may be vulnerable or at risk of abuse do not have the same legal protection as their counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales.  I call on the Executive and the responsible Minister to frame the legislation and bring it before the Assembly as soon as the legislative timetable allows.  It is important that the legislation contains provisions to allow a properly trained professional &#8212; a social worker, for example &#8212; the right to speak to an older person alone without members of the family present.  Sadly, abuse is often carried out by those closest to an older person.  That is particularly true of the financial abuse of vulnerable older people.</p><p>I welcome the motion and thank the Members who tabled it.  The issue needs to be framed in the wider context of the general attitude to older people.  I have commented on that issue many times.  As Father of the House, I feel that I have a right and duty to speak up for senior citizens.  We have a society that does not value age and experience sufficiently, and we are all the poorer for it.  It is an attitude that shows itself in many ways.  It can be as simple as a manufacturer not making packaging that older people, with reduced strength in their hands, can open.  That may seem trivial to some, but it betrays the underlying attitude that what older people do is of no value compared with what younger people do.  I remind everyone in the Chamber that older people have a vote that is equal to the vote of younger people and that, as a rule, older people cast their vote, while younger people do not bother.  So, at the very lowest level of self-interest, every Member should seek to legislate fairly and considerately for older people.

Suffice it to say that there has been a general reduction in the number of days lost since 2006.  It has gradually been going down.  Unfortunately, it has not quite reached its target.  I appreciate that the target set for last year was just 9&#183;7, and it failed to hit that.  It reached an average of 10&#183;1 across the Civil Service as a body.  I appreciate that there would be &#163;37 million of identified savings if we were to achieve the same figure of 7&#183;6 average days in GB, but I do not see it as just &#163;37 million savings.

So, I see it as a productivity saving.</p><p>We need to work on that to ensure that we get it delivered.</p><p>It is good to recognise the good work that has been done and the programmes that have been put in place such as Carecall and the WELL programme.  Those ensure that, when people come back to work after having been off, there is an opportunity to address some of the reasons for their being off.  One of the worrying things is that 30% of days lost were associated with stress.  It did not necessarily come out in the report whether that was work-related stress or whether other issues caused the stress, but suffice to say that 30% of absences were associated with stress or anxiety.

We need to ensure that we try to address some of the reasons why individuals are telling us that they are off.  Long-term sickness is another area.  I have to recognise those members of the Civil Service who do not take any sick days.  That is a large and growing percentage, which is good to see.  In 2012-13, 55% took no sick days whatsoever.

That needs to be looked at to ensure that we have measures in place so that people can work flexibly, but supervision is also needed to ensure that the work is being done.  It is about getting the balance correct.  As a whole, it is a good report.  I welcome the downward trend in sickness days.

We are now starting to see evidence that the most vulnerable in our society are sometimes not necessarily just people who are on benefit.

I can say only that, as far as I am concerned, it was vital that we did not increase the rate overall.  As the Minister mentioned, Northern Ireland's rates are the lowest in the United Kingdom. The average rate in Northern Ireland is &#163;825, as the Minister says, while, in England, it is &#163;1,447.  We are definitely not a party to increase taxation.  I appreciate that it has been Executive policy to freeze the regional rate and ensure that &#163;650 million is raised from the regional rate component.  I think that, in total, we raise somewhere in the region of &#163;1&#183;1 billion through rates collection.  As a consequence, it is vital that we marry that up with the spend that we put through in the Budget.  I appreciate that there are some who feel that the Executive have been working, in some way, to ensure that we save money in certain areas but waste it in others.  Some people feel that there has been a Trojan Horse at work on that in recent days.  That could create some difficulties in trying to balance the Budget throughout the process.</p><p>Understanding that we have the lowest rates, we continue to have the small business rate relief scheme in place for the next year.  It is vital that those businesses take advantage of it.  I appreciate that a small number of businesses in town centres fall outside the scheme.  During the revaluation of the non-domestic rate, it was identified that some premises would benefit from the process and others would probably be made to pay more.  I appreciate that petrol stations in some areas seem to have been hit with an increase.  Most petrol stations have now become mini-supermarkets, and effectively that has added to it.  It is vital that, as banks have been withdrawing from rural communities, there was an intention to ensure that ATM providers in those rural communities could avail themselves of the rate relief.  Therefore, those who want to put an ATM in a petrol station, in place of having a bank on a village high street, will take advantage of having a small area in their shop zero-rated, which can ultimately be used to attract people into the shop. I support the motion as presented for the Rates (Regional Rates) Order (Northern Ireland) 2015.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Rates (Regional Rates) Order (Northern Ireland) 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-09", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for his answers thus far.

As Northern Ireland is a net beneficiary from the Barnett formula and the associated process, it would indicate that, no matter what we do, we will just be reducing and tinkering around the edges.</p><p>We are in favour of fiscal responsibility, but only where it benefits our community, as is evident from what has been put forward in relation to corporation tax and APD, both of which were intended to act as economic levers to grow our private sector as well as keep our links with other areas.  Long-haul APD was vital because we would have lost one of our only connecting flights to north America.</p><p>As things stand, we need to focus on a number of areas.  We need an indication as to when the devolution of corporation tax is going to be implemented because that will help those who want to invest in Northern Ireland plan and schedule for locating or increasing their workforce here.  It is important that we give that comfort to those who want to come and invest in Northern Ireland.  They need to know the date and rate at which it will be set.  Those are vital debates that need to be had.</p><p>However, we are in the dark in a number of areas because, as so much of the revenue generated in Northern Ireland goes directly back to Whitehall and is dealt with there, we do not have a handle on exactly how much is generated here.  We ran into some difficulties when Treasury told us how much corporation tax was going to cost the Northern Ireland economy.</p><p>I appreciate, from ongoing work, that a 1% rise in the rates in Northern Ireland would equate to only a small increase of &#163;5 million in the overall revenue.  The regional rate is really the only tax-raising power that we have currently.  I appreciate that a review of the non-domestic rate is being carried out by the Minister and the Department.  I think that that will bring forward some recommendations about how that process is working and whether it is working effectively.  So, I think that that review will be welcomed.</p><p>Where fiscal powers that we can or cannot have are concerned, we are dealing with the 2010 Budget, which Westminster set.  That equated to a &#163;1 billion cut in the Northern Ireland block grant, which was worked out over the next number of years.  Basically, it has been managed up to now, but, looking to the future, I think that the Office for Budget Responsibility has projected that there will be as much as a 13% cut between now and 2019.  I appreciate that, under the Barnett formula, a large percentage of our Budget will be protected under education and health, and that equates to around 65% of our block grant.  As a consequence, there is protection, and we would probably be less affected than other regions of the United Kingdom under the current format.  So, I think that it is vital that we ensure that that protection is there.  Under the current Barnett formula, we have some element of consistency and of knowing where we are for budgeting for the future.</p><p>We cannot support the Alliance Party amendment on the basis that it will equate to additional taxation.  That will not necessarily be for the delivery of services, because we know that, as soon as you start to raise taxes, it automatically impacts on our block grant.  We have some concern about that.  We need to take on board that the Alliance Party is proposing to maybe use other avenues, and I appreciate that taxation for water is one such avenue.  I cannot be sure that that would be ring-fenced and that we would be allowed to hold on to it.  It is vital that what money we have in Northern Ireland is properly spent.  That is where efficiencies come forward.  It is important that we have those efficiencies and work our way through them.</p><p>We need to target sickness absence.

That comes down to the good management of budgets.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Budget Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-16", "body": "<p>The Committee had good opportunity to go through the budgets as presented.  In doing so, there are areas I have concerns about.  We heard about transparency.  There is a lack of transparency in how the figures from Departments are presented in the Budget statement.  Block headings seem to hide quite a large spend.  Certain Departments seem to be worse at that than others.  I do not know whether that is officials or direction from ministerial level but large budget headings seem to hide large amounts of money.  Quite a bit is not as transparent as it should or could be.</p><p>We are maybe in a better position than a few months ago in that we had all sorts of doomsday scenarios if we could not achieve a Budget.  It looked as if the draft Budget was going to give serious problems.  A good of amount of work has gone on.  There have been costs:  we have wasted money in delaying the implementation of welfare reform.  Some believe that accommodations were made in that process.  There is not a big lot of difference from what was agreed 18 months ago between the Department and the Treasury.  We got it over the line through the Stormont House talks and that was something.</p><p>The rates re-evaluation process has attempted to address what was some imbalance in town centres.  Sometimes, town centres pay the lion's share of the rates.  As a consequence, they were not necessarily having the footfall to facilitate that.  To help to regenerate some of the worst-hit towns, some movement has been made.  There are winners and losers in every process but the revenue raised through the rates will not necessarily increase dramatically.</p><p>That means we have to make sure we are collecting the maximum amount of rates, which are the main taxation opportunity for this House.  As a consequence, we need to make sure that we get in the lion's share of those moneys and ensure that it is properly spent and distributed to Departments.</p><p>We have attempted to address that through the re-evaluation of non-domestic premises, which has worked in town centres.  There are those who may complain because they seem to be getting a fairly stringent hit but we raise in the region of &#163;1&#183;1 billion per year through rates.  As a consequence of the Budget Bill, we are dealing with about &#163;15&#183;6 billion.  A fairly large percentage of that is the block grant from Westminster.</p><p>The Barnett formula appears still to be the best option in town.  Unfortunately, some people say that we could do different things.  Genuinely, I believe that we are better off with the formula that is being used.  As a consequence, we have more money to spend than we generate in taxation in Northern Ireland.</p><p>I will move on to deal with Departments.  Some have delivered projects in the past four years as a result of monitoring round programmes.  We have a number of monitoring rounds in the year, taking place in June, October and January.  As a result of picking out particular things and not receiving moneys from those monitoring rounds, certain functions, which would be deemed to be key, have been put on hold.  I think that it is now vital that key functions are included as part of the bid process, as opposed to expecting the monitoring rounds to deal with them.  I see monitoring as rounds delivering the icing on the cake.  You can still have the cake, but if you want to put additional icing on it, you have to use the monitoring round process to do that.</p><p>We have to see that less money came through in the last two major monitoring rounds than had been initially anticipated.  That was a consequence of having &#163;4 billion wiped from our Budget over the four years from 2011 to 2015, which is a result of the Conservative Government's approach to Northern Ireland.  I appreciate that that hit was quite extensive, but it was managed.  Whether people believe it or not, I think that it has been managed to a large degree.  We ran into some difficulties towards the end, but that was a consequence of some past expenditure.</p><p>The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety deals with around &#163;4&#183;7 billion in the year, which makes up a very large percentage of our spend.  The Department of Health and the Department of Education spend the lion's share of our block grant.  There is some indication that &#163;200 million has gone to Health, but of a &#163;4&#183;7 billion budget, that is a very small percentage, and I see some difficulties.</p><p>I have some concerns about continuing to throw money at Departments that do not necessarily make the best or most effective use of it.  There have been some instances in which we have applied additional moneys to Departments, and when you come back and look at them a year later, you see that what was additional last year has become part of their bid for normal functions.  I think that there needs to be a realisation that we do not have a bottomless pit.  We need to make effective use of the money that we have.  I do not necessarily believe that we are getting the efficiencies that can and should be delivered from two of the Departments that are making very large spends.</p><p>On the back of what has been said, from a Committee point of view, the review of the financial process and the budgeting process has caused concern.  Some people believe there is a necessity to change that process so that there is a more streamlined, open and transparent way forward.  That has to be dealt with.</p><p>I think that there are Ministers who attempt to go on solo runs and have their own vanity projects, wish lists and personal agendas.  As a consequence of those personal agendas, sometimes they attribute a large commitment of public funds to deliver something that is deemed to be of interest to only a very small minority of people and that, at the end of the day, probably does not deliver anything other than a political or personal agenda.  On the back of that, I think that it is vital that there is a realisation that we do not have a bottomless pit of money.  If we did, you could go down the route of dealing with everyone's personal agendas.  However, we do not have that, and we have to deal with that in the round.</p><p>I support the Bill as presented.  I welcome the work undertaken by the Finance Minister, his predecessor and the Executive in bringing forward a Budget to the Assembly, which goes a large way to dealing with it.  We have the opportunity to borrow money within the next year.  Some people have asked, \"Why would you borrow?\"  We will borrow to pay for the exit programme for the public sector and will have an opportunity to reinvest that money in the years to come as we will not make that spend.</p><p>We have to grow our private sector.  There has to be less reliance on the public sector; and, as an economy, we can only go forward once we have a private sector in place that is capable of delivering for Northern Ireland and creating the wealth to keep our economy going.  We have invested moneys in the likes of Invest NI, which has gone out and probably outperformed on all its expectations on inward investment and bringing jobs into Northern Ireland.  It is our place to ensure that the jobs that are here are supported and that we encourage employers to invest and keep up the employment within Northern Ireland.</p><p>I look at it very much as someone who was involved in the private sector, and it is vital that the private sector avails itself of the opportunities when we have the powers to deal with corporation tax.  That will help others.  Some people say that a lower rate of corporation tax will mean more going into the back pockets of those who are the owners of large businesses.  To a large extent, businesses have to invest to go forward, so they will use that money to invest, whether it is in jobs or new technologies within their businesses.  That will be for them to decide, but that opportunity will be there.  A lower rate of corporation tax is one of the tools in the box.  It might not necessarily be the silver bullet, but it can and should be used.  I support the Budget Bill as presented.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Budget Bill: Second Stage"}], "title": "", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2011-05-09 13:07:07", "person_id": "13794", "entered_reason": "election", "full_name": "Paul Girvan", "member_id": "90412", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "DUP", "constituency": "South Antrim"}, {"left_reason": "dissolution", "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Girvan", "left_house": "2011-03-24", "title": "", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2011-03-28 17:40:16", "person_id": "13794", "entered_reason": "appointed", "full_name": "Paul Girvan", "member_id": "90366", "entered_house": "2010-07-01", "party": "DUP", "constituency": "South Antrim"}, {"left_reason": "dissolution", "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Girvan", "left_house": "2007-01-30", "title": "", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2008-02-26 22:25:24", "person_id": "13794", "entered_reason": "general_election", "full_name": "Paul Girvan", "member_id": "90176", "entered_house": "2003-11-26", "party": "DUP", "constituency": "South Antrim"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Givan", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>What impact is the fluctuation in the exchange rate &#8212; the strengthening pound and the weakening euro &#8212; having on our local economy, the Republic of Ireland and across Europe?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Enterprise, Trade and Investment: Trade: Island-wide Returns"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>2.

In fact, I said right at the start that:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is very much a draft piece of legislation and I do not claim that it is the finished article. I am interested in the views of interested parties with regard to the legislation and will carefully consider responses to see if my proposals can be improved.\"</p><p>I have been open and honest from the very outset that I am seeking to provide a remedy to the very clear tensions that exist.

I recognise that even the 'Belfast Telegraph', in its editorial position, has changed somewhat from when it first contributed to this in December to its most recent editorial.  That is a sign that people are engaging and debating on it.</p><p>The proposals have been grossly misrepresented.  That is as soft as I can put it.  Some may want to put it stronger.  They have been grossly misrepresented.

Restaurants, hotels, and many other businesses could refuse to serve people just because of who they love.\"</p><p>That is a lie, Mr Speaker.  It is an absolute lie.  Indeed, I could quite easily have signed that petition myself, because if that is what was being proposed, I would be opposed to it.  So, let us nail it for what it is.  It is a gross misrepresentation of what is in the Bill.  Why not have this discussion in a debate in the Chamber or in a Committee where we can tease through all the legislation?  The fact that the SDLP, Sinn F&#233;in and the Alliance very quickly wanted to stop the debate, I think does a disservice to the need for a broad discussion within our society and within a democratic establishment for that discussion.</p><p>This debate was not started by me.  In a speech to the Dublin Law Society, Baroness Hale spoke of the need for reasonable accommodation in the context of religious belief.  That was after a case where she found Christian owners of a bed and breakfast guilty.  She then said that we needed to look at this, saying that, \"The story has just begun.\"</p><p>It then became very clear in a Northern Ireland context, when the Equality Commission took the case against Ashers bakery.  I will not speak too much about that, given that the courts will be looking at it next week.  It came very much into the public domain when the Christian owners of that company were being taken to court or, indeed, persecuted through prosecution by the Equality Commission because of their sincerely held beliefs.  Indeed, Beulah Print, in Drogheda in the Republic of Ireland, is similarly in the public domain due to issues that it is having to deal with.  So, this debate was not initiated by me, but I think there is a duty on politicians to respond to it.</p><p>Of course, we were told that there would never be a need for this type of debate because the regulations would not ever do this.  In 2006, in fact, we debated the issue in the Assembly.  I was not a Member, but others were.  Ms Ruane said on the sexual orientation regulations that:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is much hysteria and misinformation about this legislation.\"</p><p>She went on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"They also claim that a printing shop run by a Christian will be forced to print flyers promoting gay sex.  They claim that it will force a family-run bed-and-breakfast establishment to let a double room to a transsexual couple, even if the family think it in the best interests of their children to refuse to allow that couple into their home.\n\nLet us debunk some of those myths.  Printers will not be forced to print flyers promoting gay sex &#8212; or any other form of sex.\" [Official Report, Bound Volume 21, p92, col 2].</p><p>Yet Ashers bakery is to be forced to promote something that it does not believe in.  We were told that that would not be an issue, and it is.</p><p>Naomi Long made a very important contribution in the same debate, and I agree with a lot of what she said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We must be very careful about saying that people should have the right to refuse business simply on the basis of people's beliefs, lifestyles, or who they are.\"</p><p>I agree with Ms Long on that; we should be very careful.</p><p>She also said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Some Members have suggested that the legislation would impose a duty to promote homosexuality\".</p><p>This is what Ms Long went on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"nowhere in the legislation is there a demand to promote a homosexual lifestyle ... The legislation contains no duty to promote or defend a homosexual lifestyle: the duty is to treat people with respect.\" &#8212; [Official Report, Bound Volume 21, p104, col 2].</p><p>I put it to the House that my proposals are exactly that &#8212; to treat people with respect &#8212; and that we should not have a duty to force people in business to do things against their religious beliefs.  I share what Ms Long indicated.</p><p>A report was published only last week that was carried out by the English Equality and Human Rights Commission.  It was a report on religion or belief in the workplace and service delivery.  It was carried out by the National Centre for Social Research.  Two and a half thousand people took part, and the findings of that report demonstrate beyond any doubt that this is a very real issue that we need to grapple with in our society.  The findings of the report indicated that people reported being mocked for their beliefs, including Christians, who said that their colleagues assumed that they were bigoted.  That is the type of discrimination that Christians are feeling in their workplace.  Others alleged that they were excluded from meetings, passed over for promotion or recruitment due to their beliefs, and felt that they were unable to raise those issues for fear of repercussions.

President Juncker&#8217;s agenda in promoting jobs, growth and investment is to be welcomed, particularly given the emphasis that the Executive have placed on those areas in our Programme for Government.  It is clear that, in scrutinising European priorities across Departments, we must examine how we are working to bring greater investment to Northern Ireland from Europe.</p><p>For too long, Departments have been working in a silo mentality.  The consequence has been that some Departments have worked well and diligently, using Europe and the potential of competitive funding for the benefit of our economy, while others have had a very hands-off approach.  That is why the report and the ongoing work of all the Committees in scrutinising European priorities are important.</p><p>We need to identify areas where our policy and the policy of the Commission intersect and build upon those synergies.  For instance, our Delivering Social Change (DSC) agenda has a clear linkage to the social investment package.  The Commission&#8217;s social investment package recommends that investment be made in children and young people and in eliminating poverty, but DSC has worked across Departments and they have worked together.  If we are to make inroads to develop our European priorities, we must do the same.</p><p>A vast knowledge bank exists in Europe.

The Minister will be au fait with the school's persistent campaign for 28 classrooms, and no one in this Chamber will contest that Dromore has an outstanding reputation for excellent education from preschool to sixth form.  Mrs Sharon Beattie's commitment to her children is matched only by Mrs Allen and her staff and Mr Wilkinson's passion for his pupils.  I have been privileged to share part of the journey with all three and count it an honour to be sought out for helping each school.  You, Minister, have been and are pivotal in the life of every pupil and family in my constituency.</p><p>It has been a long and tumultuous journey for Dromore Central Primary School.  Decision-making has been changeable and stormy, with periods of false calm and hope.  Back in March 2007, Maria Eagle announced a new build for the primary school.  That heralded the beginning of a new journey filled with hope and vision for the pupils, staff and families of the Dromore area.</p><p>On 7 February 2008, the Southern Education and Library Board carried out an updated economic appraisal with the Department of Education and revised the long-term enrolment (LTE) from 760 pupils with a 26 class base to 800 pupils with a 28 class base.  That was based on looking at future projections.  However, by February 2013, the decision had been overturned in favour of a 25 class base school based on the current pupil intake figures.  Why is there no room for optimism bias in relation to future housing?  Why is there no vision and foresight for future growth?  Why is there no room for common sense in relation to financial and economic projections?</p><p>In England, newly planned schools are built with a 10% leeway allowing for any upward trends in the future.  That obviously does not exist in Northern Ireland.  When you consider the original business plan for Dromore Central, you realise that great weighting was given to the potential future development and projected increased numbers.  That was why, on 13 June 2014, the senior principal architect of the Southern Board wrote to the director of investment, Mr Philip Irwin, to request additional expenditure of &#163;64,320 to provide piling and ground beams for an additional two-classroom extension.  Not only would that save time, but, importantly, it would save finances, as there would no longer be the need for heavy plant machinery, which would come at a great cost at a much later date.</p><p>Unfortunately, the request was turned down by the Department on the basis that it felt that the long-term enrolment of Dromore Central was 730 pupils.  Senior personnel in the Department have acknowledged and, indeed, stated that, as the population grows in Dromore, they are happy to facilitate the growth with mobile buildings, which cost in the region of &#163;200,000 each, with additional costs for heating, grounding and health and safety.</p><p>This will not be the first time that the board has failed to anticipate and plan for growth.  When building Fairhill Primary School at Kinallen, potential growth in the local area was underestimated, and no sooner had the board financed a new build than further moneys had to be spent on mobile classrooms to meet the demand in pupil numbers.  A similar set of circumstances unfolded with the new build at Donacloney Primary School and Bronte Primary School.  Money was spent on a new build and additional moneys had to be found to be spent on mobile classrooms.  Likewise, St Colman's in Lisburn, having undergone a &#163;3&#183;4 million spend, was given a new 12 class base school, yet it needed 14 classrooms.  That saw the loss of the new school library and the state-of-the-art multipurpose suite to accommodate the two additional classrooms that were needed.</p><p>It is clear that, if consideration had been given to the projected figures in relation to growth and expansion, with leeway built in for future development, additional moneys would not have needed to have been squandered on mobile classrooms and should have been put into creating a brand new school that was fit for purpose.</p><p>It must make greater economic sense to ensure that, when building new schools, weighting is given and money spent to ensure that a new school can meet the growing demands placed on it by the local community.  Frankly, it is an indictment of the Department and the relevant education boards that, soon after a new school is built, hundreds of thousands of pounds have to be found to put up temporary accommodation when a rigorous development plan would have ensured that the school was built a little bigger to accommodate the growth in pupil numbers.</p><p>It is clear that, since the new school was planned in 2007, there has been utter confusion in relation to economies of scale, financing, projected LTE and a lack of understanding of the future demographics and expansion of the Dromore area and its strategic importance on the A1 Belfast to Dublin corridor.  Earlier figures had projected that Dromore Central would increase to somewhere in the region of 884 pupils in line with the proposed additional housing developments and economic growth.  That was reviewed a number of times.  In February 2013, the Department announced that a 25 base school would be built in line with current enrolment numbers.  That is somewhat confusing, as a proposed new build was based on future, not current, projections.  Earlier correspondence between the Department, the board and the board of governors clearly shows that the school was to be built to allow for the future expansion of Dromore and the surrounding areas.  Are you confused by all this?  I am sure that you are, but there is more.</p><p>Subsequent meetings with the chief executive, Mr Boyd, have added to the confusion.  At a meeting on 16 May 2014, the chief executive expressed his support for the 28 base school to be reinstated.  At a further meeting on 27 June, having been presented with the information to show the development of a further 341 dwellings, the same chief executive expressed his willingness to request that the foundation should be put in place in order to accommodate possible future expansion, thus equipping the school for future growth at minimal cost to the public purse:  a job well done, you may think.  On 28 October, the Minister agreed that he would reconsider the decision if the board came forward with a development proposal.  To date, I am not aware of any further consultation with the school or its governors by the board on such a development proposal, something that I believe the Minister is still waiting on.</p><p>The confusion and contradictions do not stop there.  One of the biggest reasons put forward by the board for not developing the school in line with projected growth is the adverse impact that it would have on the surrounding primary schools.  Frankly, I have never heard such balderdash, since, when you consider the surrounding schools, a clear picture begins to emerge of something that all the local schools have in common:  they are bulging at the seams.  At Fair Hill Primary School in Kinallen, there were 41 applications for 39 places.  At Maralin Village Primary School, there were 45 applications for 41 places.  At Donacloney Primary School, there were 40 applications for 30 places.  What is the best thing that the Department and the board can do?  Yes:  cap the enrolment figures for the only school in the area that can meet that demand in numbers.</p><p>On 24 September 2014, the Department of Education wrote to the principal of Dromore Central to advise her that the numbers had been capped at 104 pupils, with the enrolment number of the school becoming 710 pupils.  Last year, there were 109 applications for a total enrolment of 104.  The principal managed to take in 106.  Based on the data, it would be fair to say that the school would have approximately 116 applications this year for 104 places.  Where does the Minister propose to send those children?  Surely not to the same surrounding schools that are already full to capacity and which are turning pupils away?</p><p>This was not pure coincidence.  Correspondence between representatives from the Department and the board clearly show that the reason for capping numbers was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will review the phasing in of the admission and enrolment numbers to reflect the change in class base.\"</p><p>The school for Dromore Central has been reduced from a 28 class base to a 25 class base.  Consequently, the phasing-in of the admission and enrolment numbers should be reviewed.  In layman's terms, in order to justify the irrational decision on reducing the number of classrooms, the board is capping pupil numbers to fit the school rather than the school being fit to meet the pupils' needs.  Perhaps the Minister or Mr Boyd could explain to the pupils, parents and local community the rationale behind capping the numbers at a time when the surrounding schools are filled to bursting.  Unfortunately, that leads me to question the decision-making capabilities of the Southern Board when it comes to making sound economic and financial assessments on projected growth, creating the capacity to meet growth and giving due consideration to the needs of the local and surrounding communities.</p><p>Ensuring that we build a school that provides foolproof educational help for children well into the future is key.  As I said, Dromore is a key commuter town on the A1 Belfast-to-Dublin corridor.  It is continuing to expand, and will continue to grow in line with future trends.  Indeed, I am sure that the Minister for Regional Development will concur that one of the busiest routes for public transport and commuting is the A1 corridor.</p><p>In recent months, the draft master plan for Dromore has been released.  It looked at key areas of economic development to ensure long-term financial viability for the local economy.  That is matched by the additional 341 new houses that have recently been passed for planning in Dromore and the surrounding areas.  Interestingly, it has been made clear by the board that these are irrelevant figures, and it appears that the attitude is akin to dealing with growth as and when it happens and illogical solutions such as mobile classrooms.  It brings me to question what will happen when the old primary school and high school sites are sold.  What is the business plan for the board?  It is likely that both those sites will be used for further housing developments, which, in turn, will again increase dramatically the number of children wishing to attend Dromore Central Primary School.  You may think that it is fairly logical and simple maths, and I assure you that I agree.</p><p>When I bring all those points together, it is clear that the board has disengaged when it comes to long-term planning and meeting the needs of the pupils at the school.  How can I be so sure?  It is very simple.  In July 2014, the board released a set of statistics that indicated that it would be the only education and library board that would see a dramatic rise in the need for primary-school places over the next 12 years.  Approximately 6,000 additional places are required to meet that growing demand over that period, which causes me to question why it is the policy of the Department, the board and Mr Boyd to limit the development of Dromore Central at a time when it is abundantly clear that there is a serious need for additional places in the Southern Board region.  How do the Department and the board believe that they will meet that need for additional primary-school places?  I am left perplexed and confused, with no viable or future-proof solutions.</p><p>Let us talk compromise.  From day one, Dromore Central has made it clear that 28 classrooms at this stage may not be needed in the short term.  The sensible suggestion has been to save money now by putting in the additional pilings that would allow for future building works and extensions as and when the school has the required numbers to facilitate the additional classrooms.  Minister, it is very apparent that your officials and senior representatives from the board have been so busy saying, \"No, no, no\" that they have not even looked for a way to say yes.  I understand that the school finances were due to finish in the red for this financial year, but I am hopeful that the school and the principal have managed this issue and will finish the financial year in surplus.  I am sure that the board and the Minister will be watching to see how prudent and responsible Mrs Allen has been in managing her inherited financial projection.  Minister, it is time for you to step in and make the correct decision that meets the long-term needs of Dromore Central Primary School.  The best way that makes long-term financial sense is to order the piling to be done while the present construction is under way and to save moneys in the long term to the public purse.

Those issues must remain visible, not hidden, and, for that reason, I welcome the sentiments in the Bill.  However, whilst I welcome its sentiments and the drive to ensure that we deliver for children at all levels across our Province, I have a number of concerns about it.</p><p>First, I have concerns that, although Mr Agnew believes that budgets pooled amongst Departments will ensure better collaboration on many issues, I do not believe that that will create a culture of mutual benefit or prevent Departments from delivering their own priorities.  Whilst this model has grown progressively throughout England and Wales from 2004, there is little evidence that it would work well for Northern Ireland, given our uniqueness in relation to both our systems of government and Departments.  Notably, I agree that we must continue to pursue an agenda that strengthens collaboration among Departments when it comes to issues that affect children and young people.  However, I do not think that we have enough evidence, at this stage, to show that the model proposed will create outcomes that are any better for the most vulnerable in our society.  More information in relation to that specific area would be welcomed and will help us to ensure that we are making the right decision for our children and young people.</p><p>Secondly, I share the same concerns as many of my party colleagues in relation to the financial cost, and the indirect cost of planning, managing, reporting and reviewing such collaborative programmes, placed by statutory demands, that would become mandatory for all relevant Departments as part of the Bill.  Whilst we do not have the full costs of implementation it is clear, at this stage, that they will be considerably high.  My genuine worry is that we spend a huge amount of resource at this time when budgets are already limited.  I believe that the additional resources needed, coming off the back of the proposed Bill, could be better used in ensuring that we protect the most vulnerable in society.</p><p>Thirdly, I agree &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Children's Services Co-operation Bill: Second Stage"}], "title": "", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2011-05-09 13:07:07", "person_id": "25132", "entered_reason": "election", "full_name": "Brenda Hale", "member_id": "90414", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "DUP", "constituency": "Lagan Valley"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Simon", "last_name": "Hamilton", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and respond to the Committee's report.

Looking around the Assembly Chamber, it is probably something that our Whips should take seriously as well, as it would appear that there is high degree of sickness absence in this place &#8212; perhaps some sort of lurgy or other affliction has hit Members of this House.</p><p>It is a serious issue; it is taken seriously by the Executive, and that is reflected in the Programme for Government, which sets a target for reducing sickness absence.  The target is a challenging one, and we have not been successful in reaching it every year, but I welcome the fact that there has been a general downward trend in sickness absence in the Civil Service.  It is important at the outset to note, as many contributors did, that, although sickness absence is a problem, over 55% of civil servants in the most recent year, as Mr Girvan reminded us, took no sickness absence.  That is not just one year:  it is habitually the case that over half, or a majority, take no sickness absence at all.</p><p>There were a lot of contributions throughout the debate, and, as you would expect, I am always very interested to hear suggestions about saving money.  The figure of &#163;37 million, which relates to the savings in the entire public sector if we were to take sickness absence down to the UK level, has been put out there by the Committee in its report.  Whilst that would not realise &#163;37 million in additional cash, it would be in additional productivity.  Irrespective of whether it is cash or better productivity, it is still a saving that we should pursue, and, indeed, are pursuing.  Additional productivity was a point laboured by Mr Nesbitt, who is no longer here.  He encouraged us to look at the Deloitte 'The State of the State 2014-15' report, which, as he indicated, I think, informed part of his manifesto.  I put it on the record that I contributed to the Deloitte 'The State of the State' report.  That is perhaps why it was worthy of being included in his party's manifesto for the upcoming election.  That is no doubt a very accurate explanation of why that is the case.</p><p>DFP is responsible for the Northern Ireland Civil Service sickness absence policy and procedures.  In the time that is available to me, I will deal with the recommendations that relate to Northern Ireland Civil Service Departments only.  I will leave comments on the health and education sectors to their respective Ministers, and I encourage members of the relevant Committees to pursue recommendations directly with those Ministers.  Although the Civil Service is substantial in size, with roughly 28,000 staff, the health and education sectors account for considerably more staff, with some 65,000 in health and 50,000 in education.  Action to tackle sickness absence levels has to be taken right across the public sector if we are to maximise savings from managing sickness absence.</p><p>I welcome the recommendations contained in the report.  I acknowledge that sickness absence is a topic that requires constant attention and that there is always more work to be done.  However, I am pleased to inform Members that much of what has been recommended in the report for the Northern Ireland Civil Service is either in place, under development or being considered for introduction.</p><p>Mental health and well-being features heavily in the report.  That is not a surprise.  That type of illness, and its long-term nature, has had a significant impact on overall sickness absence levels in the Northern Ireland Civil Service for a number of years, accounting for around a third of all sickness absence.  That is not particular to the Northern Ireland Civil Service; rather, it has been a general trend across the public and private sectors in recent years.  Many observers suggest that that trend will continue as issues such as job insecurity, financial pressures and general life difficulties become increasingly apparent.  A point that many Members who spoke made was that it is not clear whether that means work-related stress or, indeed, stress that is related to other aspects of people's lives.</p><p>The Northern Ireland Civil Service is going through a major period of change, which many Members mentioned, with the introduction of the voluntary exit scheme and the reduction in the number of Departments.  It is therefore vital that we have the appropriate support available to staff and managers to mitigate any potential impact that health and well-being issues will have, not only on individuals involved, managers and colleagues but on the business and the service that we provide.  Preventing sickness absence rather than reacting to it is key.  I am therefore pleased to inform colleagues that that approach is being adopted by Civil Service Departments.</p><p>The 2014 well-being survey includes stress as a major part of its analysis.  To maximise its benefits, the survey is being managed by a cross-departmental working group, which includes the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland.  The working group is coordinating and managing the survey and the response on behalf of Departments.  Departments have been asked to consider the impact of the voluntary exit scheme and the reduction in the number of Departments when considering their individual action plans.</p><p>The sickness absence recording tool, which is mentioned in the report, is a standardised list of reasons used by the Northern Ireland Civil Service to record sickness absence.  It provides for more detailed reporting on types of sickness absence as a result of stress-related illness, including work-related stress.  In many stress-related cases, an immediate referral to the Occupational Health Service is a routine intervention, while welfare and other support mechanisms are also organised.  The availability of that information has helped Departments to formulate an organisational response that is specific to their particular needs.  It allows for more targeted interventions for specific business or hotspot areas that are experiencing particular issues.  Again, targeted responses were a recommendation in the Committee&#8217;s report.</p><p>I am happy to advise Members that mental health first-aid training, which provides participants with the knowledge and confidence to recognise mental health problems, to respond helpfully and to support the person's recovery is now being offered to all Northern Ireland Civil Service staff.  I am also happy to report that the WELL programme, which received a positive commentary in the Committee&#8217;s report, has been extended for a further three years.  The WELL programme was mentioned and praised not just in the report but by several Members in their contributions to the debate.  It is worth acknowledging the success of that innovative scheme, which, as I said, has been rolled out across the Civil Service and has been extended for a further three years,  Since its introduction, we have seen a 2% increase in employee engagement; a 2% improvement in health and well-being; a 2&#183;3% decrease in staff absence due to mental health problems; and better attendance at work in 2013 compared with the 2010-11 figure, which saved us roughly &#163;1&#183;6 million.</p><p>It is an innovative programme that I am very proud of, and I welcome the Committee's praise for the WELL programme.</p><p>The \"Beating the Blues\" online cognitive behaviour therapy programme for those suffering from depression and anxiety, also supported in the report, was introduced into Occupational Health Service practice in April 2011.  It has been widely acknowledged that people on long-term sickness are at a high risk of developing depression.  In addition, depression is in itself a significant primary cause of long-term sickness absence.  Depression is regarded, therefore, as a major predictor of non-return to work and, the longer the spell of absence, the less likely a return to work.  Suitable clients are offered access to the programme as part of their OHS assessment, with the option of activating the programme through OHS or their GP practice.  Since its introduction, 99 sessions have been accessed by staff.  The programme is also actively promoted through WELL and the rehabilitation programme provided by the Northern Ireland Civil Service welfare service.</p><p>The Northern Ireland Civil Service is committed to improving staff engagement.  One of the reasons for this is that there is strong evidence to suggest that there is a correlation between increased staff engagement and reduced absenteeism.  I am happy to advise Members that a staff engagement charter was launched on 4 March 2015.  The launch of this charter clearly demonstrates a commitment from senior staff in the Civil Service to the principle of having an engaged workforce.  The charter sets out the importance of clear and visible leadership, engaging with managers, listening to staff, measuring levels of engagement, and what is expected of our staff.  Departments will use the charter as a springboard to consider how best to improve staff engagement at all levels.</p><p>The effective management of sickness absence remains a priority for all Departments.  I am confident that all Departments are working hard to reduce sickness absence and to ensure that the policies and procedures that are in place to manage sickness absence are being applied consistently.  To ensure that this is the case, a series of compliance measures have been introduced in relation to the prompt recording of absence, return-to-work interviews and the provision of appropriate certification.  These additional measures will be reviewed by each departmental board, alongside their existing absence analysis, to provide the necessary reassurance, governance and authority to ensure that any actions required are being taken forward in Departments.  HR Connect is supporting this strategy by providing specially commissioned reports to monitor the achievement of these targets.  Another initiative being explored is how the most advanced HR Connect reporting tool, Oracle Business Intelligence, could be exploited to deliver comparable management information directly to line managers across the service.</p><p>Supporting managers to manage sickness absence is, of course, of the utmost importance.  I am aware that the Northern Ireland Civil Service managing attendance training provisions have been reviewed and that a revised package of training measures has been agreed.  All staff will have health and well-being and compliance with Northern Ireland Civil Service policy and procedures incorporated into their annual personal objectives.  In addition, all departmental business plans will include, as a priority, the provision of the appropriate staff support measures.</p><p>My officials are currently considering two NISRA reports on female absence rates and sickness absence rates in the 55-plus category.  High levels of female absence rates have been an area of particular concern.  Civil Service female absence levels are over 30% more than Northern Ireland Civil Service male absence levels and almost twice that of females in the GB Civil Service.  Reducing the levels of female absence to those of male staff would have a significant impact on overall Civil Service sickness absence levels.</p><p>The rationale behind commissioning the report on staff who are over 55 was that, with a recruitment embargo, low levels of staff turnover because of the wider labour market position, the removal of any policy on age retirement in order to comply with age discrimination legislation and the probability that changes to public sector pension schemes will require staff to work much longer before they can draw an occupational pension, the Northern Ireland Civil Service workforce is likely to become an ageing one.  It is not envisaged that the voluntary exit scheme will make a significant impact on this overall trend.  As this ageing profile is likely to have an adverse impact on sickness absence levels in the future, it is important now to consider what interventions might be possible.</p><p>In the past, the Committee produced a report on flexible work practices; that is also mentioned in the report.  I am glad that the recent report acknowledged the work of DFP as an exemplar organisation in relation to flexible working.  There are many benefits, which include improved staff morale and commitment, reduced staff turnover and absenteeism and an improved work/life balance.  In recognition of those benefits, the Northern Ireland Civil Service has already implemented a number of alternative working patterns under the umbrella of flexible working, including flexible hours or flexitime; compressed hours and personalised hours; part-time working, including job sharing; partial retirement; and term-time working.</p><p>The majority of Civil Service employees can avail themselves of at least one of those schemes, and there is no doubt that they have a positive impact on the work/life balance of staff.  For example, the results of last year&#8217;s Civil Service staff survey showed that over 60% of staff agreed that they achieve a good balance between their work life and their private life.  That is something that can only have a positive impact on staff absence levels.</p><p>I assure Members that we will continue to benchmark with other organisations to ensure that the best possible practice is being applied in the Civil Service and that, where appropriate, we will engage with external providers to ensure that we tap into all available support.</p><p>Overall, therefore, I can assure colleagues that sickness absence in the Northern Ireland Civil Service is receiving constant attention.  Positive initiatives, such as the extension of the WELL programme, welfare support services and the launch of a staff engagement charter, will be important in reducing Northern Ireland Civil Service sickness absence levels.  Managers and staff are supported through dedicated training courses, online e-learning and the provision of sophisticated sickness absence data analysis.  Departments are vigilant in monitoring sickness absence trends and compliance targets and in adapting their approach in response to that data.  Targeted interventions are being deployed with the analysis of female and over-55 sickness absence in addition to the development of well-being and stress action plans.  A wide range of flexible working policies are in place to support work/life balance.</p><p>It is clear that there is no one silver bullet to resolve sickness absence issues in any organisation, not least one of the size and complexity of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.  However, I am confident that we have a wide range of initiatives in progress that, with continued perseverance, training, support and enforcement when required, will result in a reduction in the Northern Ireland Civil Service sickness absence and the associated cost to the public purse.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Sickness Absence in the Northern Ireland Public Sector"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>It is certainly our job to support businesses.  They create the jobs and make the investments, and they need to be encouraged and supported in doing that.  As I mentioned in response to previous questions, the Executive have a very good track record of supporting businesses through our rates system.  It is our main fiscal lever that we have to pull, and we have done that through the small business rate relief scheme.  Indeed, we have continued that into this current financial year, so several thousand businesses across Northern Ireland will receive that reduction in their rates bill.  That will cost the Executive some &#163;20 million.  We have done that in spite of the fact that it was introduced in 2010 to tackle the recession.  The legislation that governs it specifically talks about the downturn.  That downturn has, statistically, passed.  There are still effects for retail businesses, just as there are for construction sectors and others as a result of the downturn, but other factors are hitting our retail sector as well.  I am very keen that we continue, as we are this year through the small business rate relief scheme, to offer support to that important sector.</p><p>Our captains of industry and small businesspeople do the work and create the jobs.

I was well aware that, given the fact that there would be losers in the revaluation, there would be a plea from many quarters for some special assistance, such as some sort of transitional relief, to be put in place for, so to speak, the biggest losers.  I pondered that carefully over a period and I came to the very clear conclusion that many of the biggest losers are very large businesses.  Some of them are big global businesses that have seen their valuations go up by 40%, 50%, 60% and even more.  Those are businesses that one would expect to be paying more, compared with the 2001 valuations of those properties, so I was not sure about the ethics of offering some support through the public purse, which is, in effect, taking it from other ratepayers and giving it to those big businesses.</p><p>I was obviously concerned about smaller businesses that would lose out as a result of the revaluation.  That is why, rather than constructing a sophisticated transitional scheme on top of all the other very complex things that we have been doing with rates this year, the Executive agreed to extend the small business rate relief scheme &#8212; the Assembly has endorsed this &#8212; which will offer that additional &#163;20 million-worth of support to thousands of businesses across Northern Ireland.  Now, some of those will be businesses that have done OK out of revaluation, but many will be businesses that have done badly out of the revaluation.  I hope that that, rather than some other transitional relief scheme, will be able to afford those businesses some support and allow them to continue to stay in business in the short term and grow in the longer term.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Finance and Personnel: Rates Revaluation: Winners and Losers"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I am going to go back to a previous question from Lord Morrow, who asked about the scheme.

The criteria that have been applied in order by grade, analogous grade and discipline, where necessary, to determine who should exit under the scheme are principally based, over a one-year period, around best value for money using the least cost up front, which is the payment that would be required to give somebody a voluntary exit payment, and the maximum payback, which is how much it yields in pay bill savings.

What I also know &#8212; and I am sure that many Members will know it from contact with businesses in their areas &#8212; is that, during the recession, although some businesses shed staff and, in extreme circumstances, some had to close unfortunately, others kept themselves going through cutting wages.  We talk about pay freezes and pay restraints in the public sector.  We sometimes forget that, in the private sector, pay cuts were the order of the day in many cases.  As companies get back to strength, the economy grows and companies benefit from a growing economy here in Northern Ireland and those in our neighbouring countries and around the world, that should then be reflected in increasing wages and pay packets for our workers.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Finance and Personnel: Private Sector: Wage Levels"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I go back to the earlier question.

Whilst it is maybe easy for me, standing in my position, to look at the totality of the economy and say that things are good, that this sector is up, that sector is up and, indeed, even the construction sector, which had been doing very badly, is showing signs of growth and recovery, neither I nor any part of government can dictate to firms and businesses that their staff's wages should go up.  As the economy grows, however, it is incumbent on our businesses, as their business improves, that they pass on those benefits to their staff who, in many cases, absorbed significant pay cuts during the recession, stuck with those firms and stayed loyal to them so that they could retain the skills and experience that they brought.  If those businesses are doing well, and the markets in which they are operating are improving, any sensible business should increase its staff's wages.  That, obviously, helps the economy in a broad sense, and it also reduces the benefits bill, as those in-work benefits, which are sometimes forgotten about in a debate on welfare reform, would naturally reduce as people get paid more.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Finance and Personnel: Private Sector: Wage Levels"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I recall the strike and its impact.

The measures that I and, more so, my predecessor have introduced in that regard have come as a result of concerns expressed to us by small businesses &#8212; contractors in supply chains, particularly in the construction sector.  Measures have been introduced over the last number of years to deal with the issue, which has been highlighted, I suppose, in the very high-profile collapse of some local construction firms.  In January 2013, we introduced the ability to have project bank accounts for projects of over &#163;1 million with a significant amount of subcontracting going on.  Ten pilots have been chosen for that, and feedback so far has been positive.  Indeed, we may well look to extend it away from construction and into supply contracts too.</p><p>Perhaps more relevant to the Member's question is that a procurement guidance notice was issued in January 2012.  It has now been backed up by regulations introduced this year that monitor the performance of main contractors in a range of ways, including on their payment to subcontractors, and a certificate of unsatisfactory performance can, in appropriate circumstances, be issued.  Indeed, main contractors who are found to be failing to pass on the prompt payment that government is doing &#8212; government is very good at paying; some 91% of our invoices in DFP are paid within 10 days &#8212; can be struck off public contracts for 12 months.  Now, there has been no single case of that so far, but, as I revealed in the first answer to the question, one of the samples taken last year showed that there were some issues.  That was dealt with between my Department and that main contractor.</p><p>My Department relies on companies coming forward.  I accept the point that the Member makes about the fear that some people have, but, if subcontractors are even prepared to go through Members or other elected representatives to bring that to my attention, I assure the Member and the House that those issues will be dealt with with the appropriate seriousness.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Finance and Personnel: Subcontractors: Payments"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>There are no particular measures or statutory provisions in place to ensure that.  What is found in most cases is that those main contractors, even if they are not locally based, bring on a large number of locally based subcontractors, particularly in construction, to do their work and assist them in the provision of whatever capital project it may be.  Again, like our prompt payment, we have a good record of letting contracts of all types, whether construction or supplies contracts, to suppliers in Northern Ireland. We have a record that sometimes does not get through.  Sometimes you would think, even listening to debates in the House, that local suppliers are not getting to deliver government contracts, but that is not the case.  I think that the latest figures show that over 70% of contracts go to local firms.  Indeed, about two thirds go to local SMEs, so we have a good record in Northern Ireland not just on prompt payment to contractors but on getting local suppliers. We do that without having to manipulate. As the Member will be aware, procurement is highly governed by the European Union and you have to be very careful about what you do at local level so that you do not breach European law.

My assessment is that it was the right thing to do and has helped to rebalance the rating system.

I cannot go into all the effects of the revaluation now, but take, for example, the retail sector: the outcome is that there are far more winners than losers.  Many high streets and town centres have benefited, but there are others, such as modern convenience stores and large edge-of-town or out-of-town food stores that now pay a lot more than they did before.  This reflects their success in the real world and mirrors the relative decline of many of our traditional shopping areas.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is not LPS or DFP that decides who should pay more or who should pay less; the property market has already done that.

A lot of people express concern about the rating system.  There are some who do not like that it is based on property values and others who put forward suggestions on how it might be replaced.  I am open to looking at all those possibilities.  I am also open to looking at the reliefs and allowances that we have in place.  They have been there to try to support business and to keep it in place and operating through the downturn.  Let us not forget that the small business rate relief scheme was an intervention to help businesses through a very difficult recession.  Many of our retail businesses still struggle not because of the recession, per se &#8212; in some cases it is because of its effect &#8212; but because of other lifestyle changes, changes in our town centres and the effect of large out-of-town retailers.  I want to look at all those and other issues to make sure that, moving forward, we have a suitable system to locally tax our businesses.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Finance and Personnel: Rates: Non-domestic Revaluation"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I do not have those specific figures in front of me, but I am happy furnish the Member with them, if she will forgive me for ad-libbing, I suppose.  In her constituency, East Londonderry, you can take Coleraine as an example; it is the principal or premier borough &#8212; I do not know how they would describe it. As a result of the revaluation the average increase in rates was 7%. Let us take high streets in the constituency.  If you look at Church Street in Coleraine, you will find that its valuation fell by 40%.  This is the average in the area, and I appreciate that there will be differences.  In The Diamond, rates went down by 45%.  In Kingsgate Street in Coleraine, they went down by 30%.  The rates of the Main Street in Garvagh went down as well.</p><p>I could go into some secondary streets as well.  Bridge Street in Coleraine went down by 20%.  New Row in Coleraine went down by 10%.  Contrast that with some of the retail parks, which are up by 20% from their previous valuation.  I suggest that, if that is the average in those areas, there are plenty of winners in Coleraine and right across the East Londonderry constituency.  I accept that not everybody is a winner, but, in a revaluation, not everybody is going to be a winner.  However, a significant number of business properties in the Coleraine area, east Londonderry more broadly and, indeed, right across Northern Ireland are reflecting where the market is and are paying lower rates bills today than they were in the past.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Finance and Personnel: Rates: Non-domestic Revaluation"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>With your permission, Mr Principal Deputy Speaker, I will answer questions 3 and 7 together, as both relate to the Northern Ireland Civil Service voluntary exit scheme.</p><p>I will deal first with Lord Morrow&#8217;s request for an update.

However, there is a lot of work to be done, as we have heard.</p><p>Sentinus, the Department's front-line STEM delivery partner should also be commended.  It has secured in excess of 57,000 primary and post-primary pupil engagements annually across a portfolio of STEM enhancements and enrichment programmes.  Hopefully, it will continue despite some doubts, as it provides the Insight into Engineering programme, which is specifically designed for girls, utilises female role models to help dispel misconceptions regarding engineering careers for females and helps bridge the gender gap.</p><p>I congratulate some local schools in my constituency for the work that they have been doing to encourage more young people to take an interest in the science subjects.  In January, St Killian's College just outside Carnlough won three awards in the BT Young Scientist competition in Dublin.  Three other schools in the Larne borough &#8212; St John's Primary School, Larne High School and Linn Primary School &#8212; celebrated their success in this year's prestigious F1 in Schools challenge.  Linn Primary School was awarded third prize overall at the NEC in Birmingham just two weeks ago.  Further to that, Carrickfergus Grammar School is going to Japan to represent Northern Ireland in the world finals.  I congratulate and praise all those pupils on their achievements and their hard work that has paid off, which demonstrates some of the talent that exists in Northern Ireland.</p><p>It is those types of initiatives that are encouraging young people into the science subjects, and it is clear, when we look at the ratio of males to females in the teams that entered and won their category, that those types of events and competitions are making headway on bridging the gender gap in the STEM sector.</p><p>There have been a number of suggestions of causes for those gender imbalances, including stereotypes in the education system; a lack of female role models to aspire to be like; norms governing gender roles in the household that constrain a woman's choice of occupation; and employers' attitudes to family formation and childbearing.  In short, progress on reducing the gender gap in some subjects has been slow because there are those multiple barriers to challenge.</p><p>We must ensure that we break down those barriers and incite social change, as increasing female participation drives up skill levels, produces a wider talent pool and empowers women to ensure that Northern Ireland can compete in the highly competitive global economy.</p><p>However, we have to ensure that parents and influencers recognise the importance of STEM subjects as a career choice.  The choice of subjects must mirror the employment opportunities in Northern Ireland.  If we are to reduce the detrimental brain drain, we must ensure we develop a knowledge-based economy to compete for inward investment in the future.  Our greatest resource and economic driver is our skilled and talented people, and we must ensure that they are made aware of the opportunities available in Northern Ireland with STEM subjects in order to tackle that unconscious bias.</p><p>To achieve more equal numbers of male and female students, it is necessary for social norms to evolve.  However, things are changing, albeit slowly.  Employers' attitudes are changing, and our education system is slowly moving away from gender stereotyping.</p><p>Nevertheless, I question whether our society will ever be able to change social norms to achieve gender equality when choosing subjects at school.  The motion states that men outnumber women by three to one in STEM posts.  I am sure that the same could be said for women who choose nursing or teaching careers.  Maybe the onus lies more with the student at times to take in the information.  Worryingly, young people are still not seeing the benefits of choosing a STEM subject, but, hopefully, our schools and colleges can change their mindset and actions, and, in collaboration with others, they can learn how financially rewarding and life-changing those careers can be.</p><p>Students see scientific subjects as academically challenging, but some students are aware that they can lead to innovations, such as in medicine, that change the world and people's lives.  Let us also be mindful of the shift in the economic balance of power.  Not only is China following America in terms of STEM publication output; it is set to surpass it in the near future.  It is also producing high rates of STEM graduates, with 41% of all university graduates completing a degree in a science-, technology-, engineering- or maths-related subject.  There seems to be a greater drive among international students, specifically Asian students, who venture abroad to study STEM subjects.  The UK and America report that the number of foreign students enrolling in those subjects has risen sharply &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>Thank you, Mr Principal Deputy Speaker.</p><p>I look forward to the formation of the new ministerial Departments of Education and the Economy.

Sometimes a little prior engagement on these matters is good.</p><p>Having done some research, I noticed that Mr McMullan raised an issue in the 'Larne Times' last October on tackling underinvestment in the Causeway coastal corridor and questioning the role of Invest NI in the lack enterprise or business parks north of Larne.  The criticism of Invest NI by members of Sinn F&#233;in is nothing new.  While it was levelled during the creative industries inquiry by the same Member, it was clear that Invest NI was playing a crucial role.</p><p>One area that I would like to cover is the work of the local economic development units.  Until my departure from local government, I was the chairman of Carrickfergus Borough Council's economic development committee.  That gave me an opportunity to work closely with the LED unit at Carrickfergus Enterprise and LEDCOM in Larne.  Supported by Invest NI and in conjunction with the North East Partnership, those units have delivered a large range of programmes that have supported local businesses and industry from Whiteabbey to Moyle, including in raising finance for small firms, procurement, efficiency, energy, digital, build your business, step up to export and, importantly, family business programmes.  Those local economic development units are playing a critical role not only in supporting existing businesses and industry in east Antrim but in encouraging the smaller indigenous family-type start-ups that came to the fore during the inquiry into the creative industries.</p><p>We will, hopefully, begin to witness an upturn in business growth with the new super councils of Causeway Coast and Glens District Council and Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.  They will have to be ready to hit the ground running next month and ensure the continuity of the business support, particularly in the coastal area, with a key priority of building a strong and vibrant economy.  An opportunity in mirroring Belfast's success in leveraging European support exists and should be grasped.</p><p>The further development of the tourist industry is also important in moving forward towards a better economic climate.  With many thousands of people engaged in the hospitality and service industries in the constituency, there are many more opportunities for further employment and business creation around the heritage and cultural developments at Carrickfergus, with the Gobbins path coming on stream and with improvements in the coastal towns of Whitehead, Glenarm and Carnlough leading to the Causeway costal route and the scenic beauty of the glens.  Local government and central government must seize the opportunity for the tourism industry.</p><p>Infrastructure is crucial to any industrial investment in the area.  While we can cite the well-placed position of the constituency to the Province's airports and sea ports and look with enthusiasm at the developing road infrastructure via the A2 and A8 projects, the one necessity is a better broadband service.  I would certainly join with other colleagues who have raised that matter previously.  While it is usually envisaged as a rural problem, the east Antrim coastal area is not without its problems with broadband.</p><p>I acknowledge the Member for securing the Adjournment debate.

I doubt if there are many Members who would not acknowledge the key role that our further and higher education institutions play in growing the local economy and, more importantly, delivering on the Programme for Government and its cross-cutting priorities.</p><p>I declare an interest as part of the management of the Michael Hughes Academy, which, in partnership with the Northern Regional College, delivers a sports/academic initiative with the Newtownabbey campus.

I further acknowledge steps taken by the Minister which will, hopefully, reduce the impact and, potentially, safeguard the success of further and higher education in Northern Ireland, and I support those establishments as, collectively, we attempt to grow a sustainable economy in line with the cross-cutting priorities contained in the Programme for Government.  Therefore it is with a great deal of interest and anticipation that, as the Chair said, we look forward to the attendance of the Minister at tomorrow's meeting of the Employment and Learning Committee to get a better grasp of his overview of the landscape.</p><p>As 2014 drew to a close and the extent of the budgetary pressures facing the Department in particular, and the Executive in general, became clearer, a lobby began with the Committee, mainly involving the higher education institutions.

Further to that, colleges provide crucial support to local schools and communities, helping to tackle social deprivation, the NEET category and the key area of STEM.  Some 43% of students are from the most deprived areas, yet high percentages of retention and achievement rates are obtained.  For many, further education is a lifeline.  It gives them a second chance of achievement, plays a crucial role in their intellectual lives and gives them opportunities to engage socially, economically and culturally.</p><p>The development of the soft skills is also important, and the sector can play its part.  While the emphasis is on passing exams and graduating, training in the soft skills of the workplace is also necessary.

I shadowed him for three days at Westminster, and I could not believe that someone of his age was so energetic:  he was constantly working for Northern Ireland and the unionist cause.  Although he was, as we have heard, a quiet man of Ulster politics, he was a man with a great sense of humour.  He was a great leader and a superb party manager, with absolutely outstanding personal skills.  He campaigned for me in 2007 for the Assembly election in North Belfast, and I will never forget his encouragement.</p><p>When I was deputy lord mayor of this city, I hosted a reception for his ninetieth birthday in the Lord Mayor's parlour.  He was joined on that occasion by the former Archbishop of Armagh, because Jim was a great and committed Christian, a member of the Church Ireland and a lay reader in his parish of Killead.  I, along with many of my colleagues, am deeply saddened at the loss of a true friend.  Jim was an inspiration to me, as he was an inspiration and guide to people in the unionist community and, indeed, across Northern Ireland.  His loss today is as absolute as it is sudden and tragic.  I extend my sympathies to Agnes, Stephen, Ian and Janice, his nephews and nieces.  Today, the community in Northern Ireland is weaker and sadder for the loss of James Henry Molyneaux.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Matter of the Day: James Molyneaux, Baron Molyneaux of Killead"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for giving way.

There is an old adage \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me\".  The SDLP leader, Dr McDonnell, said that his councillors in Newry and Mourne were wrong to name a children's play park after an IRA terrorist: I welcome that.  However, the difficulty is that actions speak louder than words.  I hope that last night's change of heart by the party will not prove to be too late.</p><p>Mr McDonnell told the 'Belfast Telegraph':</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Sometimes these things take a little bit of time to sort out.\"</p><p>As Mr Lunn has rightly said, 14 years after the SDLP supported it initially, it is still not sorted out.  That is a strange comment to make when his party voted for this in 2012.  The SDLP tells us that its policy is to oppose the naming of public spaces after military or paramilitary individuals.  There is only one remedy: remove this odious decision and rename the park.</p><p>Initially, the SDLP excuse for eight councillors not turning up was that the party thought that the matter was to be deferred: not so.  The 'News Letter' revealed on Thursday 26 February that the SDLP could not have been caught out by the importance or lack of importance of the meeting or its status for decision-making because the SDLP requested the meeting and the minutes of a staff and policy equality committee meeting of the council on Monday 19 January record that Councillor Carr of the SDLP proposed and Councillor McArdle of the SDLP seconded a proposal that the council arrange a special meeting of the said committee with full plenary powers.  It gave them one week to 10 days to discuss the consultation.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: McCreesh Park"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>Given the import of the decision, the embarrassment it has caused your party and what your leader has said about the issue, I would have made sure, if I was leader of the party or the group, that my councillors were there.</p><p>Perhaps the SDLP leader should clarify what he is reported to have said in the 'News Letter' on Monday 23 February:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I will be doing all I can, and applying all the pressures ... nobody&#8217;s in a position to guarantee anything.\"</p><p>That is an absolutely pathetic statement for a party leader to make on the issue.  If the leader of the party is in a position to guarantee anything, it is an appalling decision.  We have to assume, therefore, that either the SDLP cares nothing for community relations and the sensitivities of victims or that it agrees with one of its councillors, Councillor Kate Loughran, who said that she:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"would know the McCreesh family personally and they would actually be very good friends of mine ... They had a lot of suffering down through the years ... Basically, I just think the issue should be closed and let the family move on.\"</p><p>Councillor Loughran continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I believe there is a direct correlation between the idea of Raymond&#8217;s comrade, Bobby Sands, who said, &#8216;let our revenge be the laughter of our children&#8217;, and the naming of this park.\"</p><p>Councillor Loughran believed, therefore, that it was entirely appropriate to name a play park after a convicted IRA terrorist.  That is surely wrong in the eyes of all right-thinking people.</p><p>The decision is odious, wrong and disgusting, and it needs to be changed.  It is time for the SDLP to undo this appalling decision, as they should have done in 2012.  Failure to do so endorses Councillor Loughran's position and is further evidence that the party has lost its moral compass.  It has shamefully campaigned to have dissident terrorists moved from prison.  The party gives no credence to the fears, concerns and hurt of victims in Northern Ireland.

I will begin by declaring an interest as a member of the Policing Board and as a former member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, where I served as a part-time officer.</p><p>When you hear about the proposals, they do not make sense.  In my career, when I worked with Pearl Assurance, I travelled all over Northern Ireland.  I know the area that we are talking about very well.  I travelled regularly from Belfast to Newry and from Newry to Portadown up into Rathfriland, which is the area that we are talking about.  It does not make sense to me from a security point of view &#8212; I will deal with that first &#8212; why we would send officers from Lurgan towards Banbridge in an armoured police car.</p><p>We are going to set up patterns.  To a certain degree, we could have officers targeted because of these changes.  We all know that the dissidents have not gone away, and we all know that the dissidents have already murdered police officers in this constituency.  We have to remember that a police officer is on duty 24 hours a day.  None of us wants to walk behind another cort&#232;ge of a police officer going to his grave, having served this community.</p><p>The area that we are talking about is very rural.  One of the things that sticks in my mind is the number of thefts of agricultural equipment and machinery that there have been.  I asked questions on that of the police at the Policing Board.  It was fascinating to discover the number of implements and vehicles that had been stolen and never recovered.</p><p>If you want to make a quick getaway out of Banbridge, the A1 is the way to go.  You can be in Newry before you know it; you can be in Belfast before you know it; you can be totally out of sight very quickly.  Sometimes, good roads create problems of their own and, certainly, the A1 is a major issue.</p><p>I also have concerns in relation to road traffic accidents.  We have had major accidents and fatalities on the A1.  We need to have the police there quickly.  If they have to travel from Lurgan in an armoured car, there is a speed limit within which they can travel, and then they have to get an ordinary police car to that point.  It is a ridiculous situation that I do not want to see.</p><p>The drugs issue is also a major one.  None of us wants to see criminals prosper.  Criminals will prosper if there is no police activity or sign of police activity.  We have made reference to Patten several times during the debate.  During the Patten proposals, there were, of course, proposals to extend part-time police officers.  We do not have an extension of part-time police officers; in fact, part-time police officers are virtually disappearing.  We need policing with the community and in the community.  If the officers are not known to the locals, they will not have a rapport, and they will not speak to them or pass on information.  One of the last debates I took part in on policing, Mr Deputy Speaker, related to your constituency, when we were talking about the police having to go down the glens of Antrim from Ballymena.</p><p>This has not been thought out, and it cannot be forced on a community without some form of consultation.  Successful policing has been seen to happen in Banbridge.  Successful policing is there because of the fact it has a relatively low crime level.  Take away the police and what do you have?  You basically have an open door for criminals, drug pushers and that ilk who want to use this.  I have major concerns for the safety of the people of Banbridge, and I am prepared to sit here tonight with my colleague.  I agree with others who have said there should be more in the Chamber.  This is not just about Banbridge or Upper Bann.  It is about policing in Northern Ireland.</p><p>It is a disgrace that we do not have a Minister here to make a response.  The Minister is, supposedly, the Minister of Justice.  Where is the justice for the people of Banbridge if the Minister cannot even come here to make a statement?  Yes, the Chief Constable is ultimately responsible for the Police Service of Northern Ireland, but he is not being given the budget.  That is another major issue.  Yes, &#163;14 million was handed back.  That is ridiculous.  It is ridiculous that &#163;14 million had to be handed back, but that was because he is unable to carry money forward.  That is because of a ridiculous situation that exists in our policing legislation.  It should be sorted by the Minister of Justice, so that the police can hold such money and use it properly for the people of Northern Ireland &#8212; for the people of Banbridge, the people of Upper Bann.

It may be 150 years since the establishment of Magee college and 50 years since the Lockwood report, but it seems that about 50 minutes have passed since we last discussed Magee.  One could nearly suggest that there is an election coming up.</p><p>I am tempted to repeat what I said about Magee in the debate that we had on 19 January.  However, to save time, I simply invite Members to consult Hansard from that date, Hansard from 16 September 2014, when I spoke in an Adjournment debate on the Magee expansion, and Hansard from 17 September 2013, when my colleague Sandra Overend spoke for my party on the issue.</p><p>Suffice to say that the Ulster Unionist Party has been consistent in wishing to see higher education expansion in the north-west but, at the same time, that has to be done in a planned and fully costed way.  That is particularly so in light of the reality of the budgetary constraints that many in the Chamber were content to support in the voting Lobbies.</p><p>It might be instructive for Members to be reminded of some history.  The Ulster University at Magee, formerly known as Magee College, is the campus of the Ulster University located in Londonderry, which first opened 150 years ago as a Presbyterian Christian arts and theological college.  It took its name from Martha Magee, the widow of a Presbyterian minister who, in 1845, bequeathed &#163;20,000 to the Presbyterian Church of Ireland to found the college for theology and the arts.  It opened in 1865, primarily as a theological college, but accepted students from all denominations to study a variety of subjects.  As a Presbyterian, I am delighted to point out how generous that church has been in establishing seats of learning and handing them over to the state to benefit the wider society.  Perhaps others should take note.</p><p>Since 1953, Magee has had no denominational affiliation and provides a broad range of undergraduate and postgraduate academic degree programmes.  In the 1960s, it was hoped by many that that university college would become Northern Ireland's second university.  However, as we all know, a committee under Sir John Lockwood, an English academic, published a report on 10 February that recommended a greenfield site at Coleraine for a new university and for Magee College to be closed down.  Clearly, that recommendation was not fully accepted or implemented, because Magee was not closed down by the Stormont Government.  Instead, it was incorporated into the two-campus New University of Ulster in 1969.  I remind Members of that because some of the rhetoric used by nationalists in previous debates involved stating, as if it were a historical fact, that the establishment of UUC was a sectarian decision.</p><p>One of the most iconic pictures of that era is that of the Lord Mayor of Londonderry leading a protest parade to this Building in favour of the siting of the new university in Londonderry.  That mayor, flanked by nationalist leader Eddie McAteer and the future SDLP leader John Hume, was Commander Albert Anderson, an Ulster Unionist.  Plenty of unionists were in favour of expanding Magee into Northern Ireland's second university in the 1960s, but the matter is, to coin a phrase, somewhat academic now.</p><p>However, for those Members who are interested in the detail of what happened in the 1960s, rather than simply accepting the story of a historic wrong and unionist discrimination, I invite them to read the book by Gerard O'Brien, 'Derry and Londonderry: History &amp; Society', chapter 26, which is entitled, \"Our Magee Problem: Stormont and the Second University\", and is available on the CAIN website.  Page 685 states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The facts indicate that the Lockwood Committee made its decision on the location of the university on the basis of practices long accepted as sound with regard to the establishment of new British universities.\"</p><p>So much for history.  The question is this:  where are we now and where are we going?</p><p>Magee has grown in recent years from a nadir of just 273 students in 1984 to over 4,000 undergraduates now.  The Ulster University has lobbied the Executive for an additional 1,000 full-time undergraduate places with a target of 6,000 students at Magee in 2017.  Then we have the One Plan published by Ilex nearly five years ago.  It has a more ambitious target of 9,400 places.</p><p>However, since the debate that we had last September, we have had severe cuts to further and higher education in the draft Budget for 2015-16, ameliorated, but only partially, in the revised Budget agreed by Sinn F&#233;in and the DUP.

The latest NISRA stats on claimant count show that Londonderry has the highest rate at 8&#183;6%, Strabane has the second highest at 7&#183;7% and Limavady has the fourth highest at 6&#183;9%.  The Northern Ireland average is 5&#183;4%, and almost half the council wards in the three districts are ranked in the top 20% of the most deprived wards in Northern Ireland.  If we look at the interactive maps on the NISRA website, we see that it is clear that, over the 30-plus years that the claimant count has been used as a standard measurement of unemployment rates, fluctuations in the north-west have closely mirrored Northern Ireland trends.  Limavady had about the Northern Ireland average from 1997 to 2007, the year in which all of Northern Ireland, including the north-west, had the lowest claimant count.  Strabane and Londonderry have always been above the average.</p><p>If we look back to 1992, we see that the figures were much worse than they are today, despite the worldwide recession.  In 1992, average unemployment for Northern Ireland was 10&#183;7%, with 15% in Londonderry, 15&#183;3% in Strabane and 12&#183;7% in the Limavady district.  I remind the House that, in 1992, Northern Ireland as a whole was still subject to a terrorist campaign that included IRA attacks on what it termed \"economic targets\", which included bombings in cities and town centres.  For example, the IRA exploded a large van bomb in the centre of Coleraine on Friday 13 November 1992.  That bomb caused extensive damage to the commercial heart of the town.  That context always needs to be restated when we talk about the historically high levels of unemployment in parts of Northern Ireland.  It is completely proper for MLAs from the north-west to highlight problems and to push hard for improvements in areas such as infrastructure.  However, I urge Members to show restraint in the language that they use.</p><p>The motion refers specifically to the expansion at Magee.  On 16 September last year, I spoke in an Adjournment debate on the expansion of the Magee campus of the Ulster University in Londonderry.  In that debate, I quoted my colleague Sandra Overend, who had made the point in a similar debate on 17 September 2013:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we need to have clarity on the expansion.  We in the House are all aware that budgets are stretched throughout all Departments, and the higher education budget, I am sure, is no different.\" &#8212; [Official Report, Bound Volume 87, p63, col 2].</p><p>In response, the Minister, Dr Farry, who I am pleased to see here today, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"For what we have adopted to date, which has been a policy of incremental growth of university places that adopts a pan-Northern Ireland approach, albeit, I have to confess, with a certain skewing towards the University of Ulster and Magee ... incremental growth can still continue\". &#8212; [Official Report, Bound Volume 87, p66, col 1].</p><p>I commented in that debate that Members should note this exchange and consider how much more pertinent it is one year on in the context of a Budget that is now more broken than stretched.  The Minister stated last year that incremental growth can continue.  In December 2011, he stated that an extra 700 undergraduate places would be made available in Northern Ireland by 2015, and, at the same time, the University of Ulster stated that the 322 extra places being awarded to it would all be allocated to the Magee campus.  Today, given the mass of potential consequences of the reduction to higher and further education indicated in this draft Budget, it would be useful in summing up at the end of this debate if the Minister for Employment and Learning brought the House right up to date.</p><p>Finally, the Sinn F&#233;in amendment on the decentralisation of jobs is interesting.  Coming as I do from Omagh, I know that we have not seen much sign of any decentralisation towards Tyrone into either Omagh or Strabane, which are, of course, the two major towns in my constituency of West Tyrone.  I want to see jobs in the west, and I want to see Omagh thrive.  I want to see the entire region thrive, but we have a major mountain to climb, and we seem to have a major river to cross.  West of the Bann is still a no man's land in job creation, and we need to see support for our constituents in Foyle, West Tyrone and East Londonderry.</p><p>There are many surplus buildings in the area.  The area plans need to be updated and supported.  For example, the master plan for Omagh is being written.  Although Omagh is not included in the proposals that are being debated today, the same process is required in all the council areas affected.  Let us put our wares on display.  Let us show what we have to offer to tempt jobs and, indeed, to decentralise jobs to the relevant district council areas.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Employment: North-west"}, {"date": "2014-12-09", "body": "<p>Will the Minister give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Western Health and Social Care Trust: Impact of Cuts on the Omagh Area"}, {"date": "2014-12-09", "body": "<p>I accept that the trust changed its plans, but, as I said at the time, the plans were moronic.

Members will recall that the previous occasion the matter was discussed in the Chamber was in an Adjournment debate on Tuesday 24 June 2011.  We are some years down the line from that.  However, for Colin, the situation remains unchanged.  He continues to pursue his very dignified and honourable campaign to find redress.</p><p>The facts are well established in Colin's case.  The fact that he spent 30 months on remand before he was released without charge has had a profound effect on him and his family.  Colin feels very strongly that a heavy stigma has been attached to his undeserving association with Adrian Carroll's murder and that that has prevented him from undertaking many of the normal and honourable pursuits in his life that he would have otherwise pursued.  Indeed, his passion lay with the army, and he was devastated when his contract was not renewed and he had to leave the profession that he loved.  His unwarranted and erroneous journey through the legal system at that time was significant for the length of time that he was held on remand.  In today's terms, it would represent a very serious sentence.  Lord Morrow made that point in the previous Adjournment debate.</p><p>Through my numerous meetings with Colin, he has stressed that all he seeks is to be fully recognised as innocent and for the ordeal that he was put through to be appropriately addressed.  That has always been the position, and it is one that I fully support.</p><p class=\"italic\">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p><p>When anyone looks at the facts of Colin's case, they see that it is very clear that, of course and importantly, whilst Lord Justice Kelly acquitted him in the first instance, he had already served a lengthy period on remand.  What is obviously concerning for him is that those who were convicted and then had those convictions overturned then qualified for compensation and were duly awarded it.  I made the point in the House back in June 2011 that the process of exoneration and compensation in the instances of those convicted and then acquitted was much more public, much more publicised and much more conclusive in getting closure for the accused.  Colin has never had a sense of closure.  That is the crux of the issue and the injustice that our Justice Minister should move to put right for Mr Worton.</p><p>The previous Adjournment debate &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: UDR Four"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I will, yes; OK.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: UDR Four"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for his intervention, and I agree fully with him.</p><p>The previous Adjournment debate was important for establishing the views of the Justice Minister, David Ford, and it included useful debate between Members, including those with experience of law.</p><p>Given that the Justice Minister has the necessary authority under our devolved Assembly institutions to respond to the case, Mr Ford, at the time, pledged to reassess Colin's case and gave assurances to fully take on board the contributions made by Members in the House on 21 June 2011.  Those contributions, by and large, supported the case for redress to be made by the Minister.  The Minister responded to Mr Worton on 28 October 2013 stating that, after a thorough review of the case, Colin was not eligible for the ex gratia scheme.  I ask the Minister to tell the House today whether he believes that Colin Worton has been completely exonerated of any wrongdoing in the murder of Adrian Carroll.</p><p>In revisiting this important case, the main thrust of the motion is a request to the Justice Minister to further consider Colin Worton's case, thereby acknowledging the ongoing circumstances affecting Colin, and to move to exercise his discretion to get redress for Colin in light of the significant ordeal he has come through.  With this firmly established, I am concerned that the Minister, through the amendment tabled by his party colleagues, has clearly signalled that he is closing the door on any possibility of discretionary redress.  That, I believe, sends a very poor signal to Colin and is an unfortunate contribution from the Justice Minister's party. The amendment runs against the grain of the goodwill that was generated in the previous Adjournment debate.  Alliance Party Members have sought to make an amendment that, in effect, would end any chance of future liaising between Mr Worton and Mr Ford.  I must say that I find that unhelpful.</p><p class=\"italic\">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Beggs] in the Chair)</p><p>There is merit in the Justice Minister redoubling his efforts to seek redress for Colin, and those should be especially directed at the manner in which the confession was obtained in light of the words of Justice Kelly in rejecting the confession as inadmissible.  The following quotation is on the record of the Chamber, and it is worth repeating it today to set in context the basis of the case for redress for Colin.  Mr Smyth QC stated that Colin's statement:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"had been induced by the detectives at Castlereagh by a trick which embraced threats and dishonest promises and oppressive and unfair means.\"</p><p>Colin remains firmly of the view that the methods used in his interview did indeed represent a serious default on the part of the police.  This tallies with the findings of Lord Justice Kelly when, in rejecting the evidence before him, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the assurance of a fair trial includes the right to be protected from evidence which might have an unreliable effect on the result of the trial.\"</p><p>In the letter to Mr Worton of 28 October 2013, the Justice Minister confirmed that he had reviewed the case under the ex gratia scheme and, importantly, in the realm of exceptional circumstances, which included the suggestion of serious default by the police.  The conclusion reached by Mr Ford that he continues to be ineligible for compensation remains a source of great concern for Colin.  I appeal again for the Justice Minister to look again at the case. I take the opportunity to go further and ask him to use this very serious example as a basis for improving the criteria and guidelines under which the scheme is operated.</p><p>The word \"inability\" is used in the amendment.  However, in the letter to Colin of 28 October 2013, it is stated clearly that responsibility for Mr Worton's application was transferred to the Department of Justice on devolution.  It is therefore the case that the Justice Minister has ability in this regard, and the motion urges him to use that ability to reach a satisfactory and deserving conclusion for Mr Worton.</p><p>It is an unacceptable state of affairs in the outworking of justice that someone who is held for so long with such notable negative effects, lasting over 30 years, cannot find redress.  I respectfully put the motion to the House in the hope that the wrong can be righted.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: UDR Four"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>As Chairperson of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee, I welcome the opportunity to speak in today's debate.  As a Committee, we undertake a considerable volume of scrutiny work on EU issues.  Many of the agenda items that we consider at weekly Committee meetings, such as statutory rules, originated in the European Commission.  Therefore, today's debate is of particular importance and interest to the Committee.</p><p>Aside from that, we are fully focused on a number of key areas; namely, the implementation of CAP pillar 1, including the single farm payment and the rural development programme (RDP) 2014-2020.  Any policy reform has the potential to cause concern, and, as a result, the Committee undertook in-depth scrutiny of how CAP reform in pillars 1 and 2 will be revised and implemented.  We also paid attention to the common fisheries policy (CFP).</p><p>CAP is a key EU policy area and accounts for a large proportion of the EU budget.  It has gone through a major reform, and how the EU funding is allocated is of great concern to not just the Committee but our farming industry.  CAP pillar 1 is worth approximately &#163;270 million to &#163;280 million a year.  That is a significant sum of money, and we intend to oversee how it is distributed.  That funding makes a huge difference to the farmer and the rural community.  It helps build and sustain the industry, and the Committee does not want to see a detrimental impact on our agrifood industry as a result of a change in policy.</p><p>The Committee recently met the EU commissioner Mr Hogan, and we took the opportunity to discuss some of the issues of concern with CAP pillar 1; namely, the definition of \"young farmer\" and of \"active farmer\", direct payments and the mid-term review of CAP.  We also raised the need to simplify the rules and regulations around CAP.  We will be following closely the forthcoming approval of the Northern Ireland rural development programme 2014-2020.  The programme is vital for improving competitiveness in the industry as well as for safeguarding and enhancing the rural environment.  We want to see the EU Commission approval as soon as possible.  At the meeting, Commissioner Hogan gave some indication that legal approval will be given in June or July 2015.   He also said that the recent announcement on loans to farmers would mean the need to write a new programme into the RDP.  We look forward to hearing from DARD on the potential of that and on the opportunities that will arise from the new financial instrument.</p><p>Volatility in the dairy, beef and pork industry is a recurring issue for the Committee at the moment.  We received several briefings from the industry and heard about the current difficulties in that area owing to global market conditions.  We have written to our MEPs, the European Commission, local banks and our counterparts in the Republic of Ireland.  That worrying issue was discussed with the EU commissioner, and he indicated that some measures will be put in place to ease the situation.  The Committee wants to see proposals for a fairer and more sustainable market for our farming industry as a whole.</p><p>This year, the Committee will remain focused on CAP, CFP and the Northern Ireland RDP, as well as on issues identified in the European Commission work programme, such as beef-labelling rules and fishing authorisation regulation.  We will continue to scrutinise all proposals from the Department and the EU, including the issue of red tape, to ensure that a positive outcome is reached for farmers, the agrifood industry and, indeed, the rural community.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: European Scrutiny Priorities 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for her statement.

Children represent our future.  That is a very clear and obvious statement of fact.  Therefore, it should be with that in mind that we consider this important issue.</p><p>At the outset, I must ask why a significant section of the elected membership of Newry and Mourne District Council continue, even as recently as last night, to perpetuate a situation that should never have been created in the first place.  To name a play facility after a convicted terrorist is, I feel, one of the most ridiculous decisions that has ever been taken by a local council.  I took it upon myself to raise a complaint with the Equality Commission back in December 2012 following a decision after review by Newry council to maintain the current park name.</p><p>Through various meetings with the commission and correspondence back and forth, it was decided that my complaint would be superseded by the commission's investigation, such was the seriousness with which it viewed the situation.  However, a couple of years later, we had a recommendation from the commission to Newry council to review its processes and again consult the public on the play park name.  The result of that process has been an astounding repeat of previous form and another two votes by Newry and Mourne District Council in support of retaining the McCreesh park name; the latest was last night, when a proposal to discuss the matter was rejected by Sinn F&#233;in.  That beggars belief.</p><p>I believe that it shows a complete lack of respect for due process and a disregard for any view or recommendation that the Equality Commission may bring forward.  Indeed, on that point, I feel that the Equality Commission must respond to the arrogant attitude displayed, chiefly by Sinn F&#233;in councillors in Newry but, it has to be said, no less assisted by the acquiescent nature of the SDLP councillor grouping there.  Sadly, all the SDLP councillors, except one, failed to show up last month on the night of the vote, even though they had proposed that the issue should be considered.  By their actions, therefore, they failed to carry through the wishes of their party leader in repairing the hurt that he is on record as saying was unwittingly caused.</p><p>I remain very concerned that, in this day and age, the Equality Commission has acknowledged that clear breach of section 75, and it appears toothless to challenge that persistent wrong.  The flip side of that debate is, of course, the commission's almost speed-of-light approach to dealing with the owners of the Christian bakery over an iced cake.  It really does stand in stark contrast.  The two issues could not stand more opposed to each other in seriousness and gravity, yet one has been very publicly held aloft and pursued with every available weapon in the arsenal of the Equality Commission, whilst the other trudges along with no apparent urgency at all.</p><p>At the core remains the fact that, in Newry city, there is a play facility for kids named after a member of an illegal terrorist organisation &#8212; indeed, a convicted terrorist &#8212; that conducted a reign of terror, destruction, murder and bloodshed on the people of Northern Ireland.  The rifle that McCreesh was found to possess was used in the slaughter of 10 innocent men at Kingsmills &#8212; a night that lives on vividly in the hearts and minds of many of us, especially the families affected by that atrocity.  It is untenable to think that, only a few miles down the road from Kingsmills, we have a kids' playground named in memory of McCreesh.</p><p>I must criticise the Equality Commission because I believe that it is failing to deal with the issue effectively, given the depth of feeling that exists.  The situation must change immediately.  I challenge the commission to conclude its process and issue its judgement in this case.  How can an iced cake end up in the courts and a terrorist-named play facility simply amble along with no clearly defined end in sight?  That is what my constituents ask me daily, and that demands an answer from the Equality Commission.</p><p>I believe that the SDLP has now seen the error of its way in supporting the naming of the play park and is now publicly repositioning itself &#8212; and not before time.  However, Sinn F&#233;in predictably remains unmoved and uncaring in every sense of the words towards the wider community, unionist and moderate nationalist, who reject the naming debacle outright.</p><p>Local councillor colleagues who have been engaged in setting up the new councils tell me of the importance of the new councillor code of conduct.  I understand that many hours of training have been undertaken to ensure that the elected representatives who sit on the 11 councils are fully aware of their responsibilities and the rules governing their participation in local government.  That document contains lengthy direction on behaviour and responsibilities and what is acceptable and unacceptable when carrying out council business, and it will be rigorously monitored and enforced, with many councils implementing audio recording of meetings.  I do not find any defence in that code of conduct for the actions of those Newry and Mourne councillors who proposed, and who have voted on a number of occasions, to maintain naming the park after Raymond McCreesh.</p><p>Indeed, it flies in the face of the code of conduct.  Did Newry and Mourne council promote good relations and provide a positive example to the wider community by doing what it did?  Absolutely not.  Did it act with the whole community in mind when it made this decision?  No, it did not:  just ask the minority unionist community in Newry and Mourne, who suffered at the hands of people like Raymond McCreesh.</p><p>I ask that Mark Durkan MLA, as Minister with responsibility for local government, address the House today and leave the Northern Ireland rate-paying and voting public in absolutely no doubt as to the aims and objectives of the 'Code of Conduct for Councillors'.  I ask him for his comments on the actions of his council colleagues in the SDLP in Newry and Mourne council.  I must say that it is poor on the SDLP's part that it was, in fact, that party that asked for the naming of the park to be discussed last month, yet it did not show up for the vote.  That must be explained by Mr McDonnell as leader of the SDLP.  I want an assurance in the Chamber from the SDLP leader that this matter will be revisited and put right, as anyone with a shred of conscience and credibility would rush to do, given the age in which we live, where, across the world, terrorism rains havoc and brings abject sorrow to hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>I conclude by saying this:  Sinn F&#233;in has been very vocal recently in calling for equality.  In fact, it tells us that equality is going to be used as a \"Trojan horse\" to break the DUP and unionism generally.  I give Sinn F&#233;in members one small piece of advice:  if, by causing outrage in the unionist community, Sinn F&#233;in believes that the republican Trojan horse equality agenda has been advanced one iota, sadly, it is very much mistaken.  The decision by Newry and Mourne council to name a play park after a convicted terrorist has only served to reinforce the view of many unionists that pan-nationalism is alive and well.  Nothing less is expected from the apologists for terror, Sinn F&#233;in.  Shame, however, on the SDLP.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: McCreesh Park"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>Our Deputy Chairperson, Mr Joe Byrne, was to wind up today, but he sends his apologies for missing the debate.

I thank the staff of the Committee for all the hard work and effort that they have put in with regard to the programme and the inquiry over the last number of months.</p><p>As Chairperson of the Committee, at the start of this debate, I outlined the background and highlighted the main recommendations that we are presenting to the Minister.  I was very interested in her reply, and I look forward to reading Hansard and giving due consideration to the points she made.</p><p>I am delighted to see so many people taking part in the debate.  Rural issues and rural development have tended to be overlooked to a degree.  I am glad that the debate has brought the issues to the fore, and I am pleased to be able to emphasise on the Floor of the Assembly the outstanding work that the community and voluntary groups have been doing.  That has been one of the key themes of the debate, and it is great to see the work of rural groups recognised and acknowledged.</p><p>Another theme emerging is the success of the individual projects in the overall TRPSI framework, particularly the MARA project.  Some here today have referred to the statistical evidence of the great work that MARA has done, but the success of MARA owes much to its approach.  It is an approach that we would like to see duplicated and retained in any future TRPSI programme.</p><p>The issue of rural deprivation has also been raised by many MLAs representing rural constituencies.  We know how big an issue this is, and that is why we need to see work started as soon as possible on the review of how rural deprivation is measured and used.  While there is guidance on how to apply deprivation indices in rural areas, it is disappointing that there is no evidence to suggest that this guidance is being used.</p><p>I will now summarise the contributions made by other Members.  Mr McAleer commented on rural deprivation and outlined some of the issues in how it is measured.  Se&#225;n Rogers felt that there was a need to ensure that no policy had a negative impact on the rural community and that steps needed to be taken to continue to advance services and facilities in rural areas.  Jo-Anne Dobson paid tribute to the farm families health checks and praised the nurses who delivered the programme.</p><p>Kieran McCarthy said that the rural community continually strives to keep its head above water and that many problems continue.  He said that TRPSI is to be commended for its success and that stakeholders were happy with DARD and the partnership approach.</p><p>Mr McMullan commended the Minister for TRPSI.  He said there had been significant investment across the Departments to deliver programmes and there have been many successes to date.  Ian Milne felt that there was a challenge to make sure of all information gathered to date and to use it effectively.  He said that councils need to work in partnership to share responsibility and good practice.</p><p>While Mr McGlone welcomed the impact that TRPSI has had, he said that there is room for improvement.  He then focused on the data captured from MARA.  He said that super-councils have a role to play.</p><p>Tom Elliott said that there is a need for revised guidance on childcare provision and said that it is becoming unaffordable.  He said that access to services is an ongoing issue and that transport problems are also a concern for the rural dweller.  He also said that working and living in isolation leads to mental health problems.</p><p>Tom Buchanan said that, just because DARD is the only Department with \"rural\" in its name, it does not mean that it should be the only Department covering rural services.  He said that it is important that other Departments are involved.</p><p>Sydney Anderson, like many others, praised the rural stakeholders for their commitment and work.  He singled out rural transport as the main issue affecting rural communities.</p><p>I think that that has covered everyone.

TRPSI focuses on three priority areas for intervention:  access poverty; financial poverty; and social isolation.  Its aim is to cover target areas such as the elderly, lone parents, the disabled, the unemployed and children.</p><p>The framework is delivered by DARD in partnership with other Departments and includes a wide range of programmes, each with its own objectives and targets, with an overall evaluation anticipated some time this year.  It is also one of the Department&#8217;s targets in the Programme for Government and the rural White Paper action plan.</p><p>Members will be aware that those who live in rural areas are often at a disadvantage when it comes to service provision and employment prospects.  They are often isolated and are living in poverty.  Things that the urban dweller takes for granted, such as broadband, regular transport, access to essential services and job opportunities, are often missing in rural areas.  This can have a long-term detrimental effect on rural dwellers, their families, their health and life in general.  We are all too familiar with stories of the hardship and loneliness faced by the person living on their own or the desperation felt by our young people with no job prospects.</p><p>With this in mind, the Committee agreed to review the current TRPSI programme to find out how effective it has been and whether it could be improved in order to maximise opportunities.  The Committee took evidence from a wide range of community and voluntary groups, the Department, the Public Health Agency and statistics' experts.  It also commissioned a number of research papers on issues affecting rural poverty and isolation.</p><p>Due to the number of interested voluntary and community groups, the Committee was anxious that it captured as much evidence as it could to inform the review.  It decided, therefore, to organise a stakeholder event, which was held in a central rural location to facilitate those groups.  It was very clear to the Committee, even before the review commenced, that the issues faced by our rural communities today are genuine, cause great concern and need to be given the importance they deserve.  The stakeholder event was a well-attended and worthwhile experience.  It showed us the passion and commitment of rural dwellers, community groups and voluntary workers and the endless hours of effort they commit to in order to improve the lives of rural dwellers.</p><p>What was apparent from all the oral evidence sessions and the stakeholder event was that there was overwhelming agreement that the current TRPSI programme has had a substantial impact on the lives of rural dwellers.  It was felt that the programmes TRPSI offers, such as the assisted rural travel scheme, farm families health checks programme and fuel poverty initiatives, to name but a few, have made a real difference to people in the rural community.</p><p>The groups and individuals that the Committee met demonstrated far-reaching local knowledge of the issues and concerns in their communities.  This is one of the factors that has made the TRPSI programme a success.  Local people working in partnership at a grass-roots level know what is happening in their own area.  They have years of expertise and knowledge, which they are able to maximise to reach out to those most in need.</p><p>The voluntary and community groups are all known to one another and have good working relationships. They are able to signpost the services available, with numerous positive outcomes to date.  This has been a key factor in the success of the TRPSI programme.</p><p>One of our key recommendations, therefore, is that the Department build on the successes of the current programme to include the knowledge of grass-roots organisations.  They know the real issues the rural community faces and have the drive and ambition to deliver solutions.  This aspect cannot afford to be overlooked by the Department, and, if used in a meaningful way, will inform and shape any future programme.</p><p>Particular mention should be made of the maximising access in rural areas (MARA) programme, delivered in conjunction with the Public Health Agency.  MARA aims to improve the health and well-being of people living in rural areas, where the hidden nature of poverty and isolation can make it difficult to connect with the most vulnerable.  The Committee heard that MARA has visited up to 14,000 households to share information on services, grants and benefits that the rural dweller may be entitled to.  This has in turn released previously unclaimed money, which has not only been of value to the individual, but has benefited the wider economy of Northern Ireland.  The success of MARA can be very clearly linked to the ability to tap into local knowledge and expertise quickly and effectively, thereby targeting those rural dwellers most in need.</p><p>Given that MARA has now collected a considerable amount of data, it is the opinion of the Committee that this data can provide a valuable insight into the issues of poverty and deprivation that the rural community faces.  This is why we are recommending that the Department fully utilises the data captured, along with the evaluation of the project when available, to inform a successor programme.</p><p>Another notable issue that emerged during the review was about how rural deprivation is currently measured.  Again, that is where the rural dweller is at a disadvantage.  Unlike an urban area, where people are socially separated, rural areas quite often have an affluent person living alongside someone deprived and experiencing real poverty.  That method of measurement has to change in order to accurately assess the real rural picture to better inform the decisions of the policymakers.  As a Committee, we have called on the Department to work alongside the Department of Finance and Personnel to commission NISRA to undertake a review of how to measure rural deprivation.  The Committee firmly believes, as do the community groups that appeared before us, that, if that review is carried out, it will make a real difference to the identification of rural deprivation and will, in turn, produce a positive outcome for the rural dweller.</p><p>Over the course of the review, the Committee heard from witnesses that there appears to be a lack of basic awareness of the use of the Northern Ireland multiple deprivation indices.  Despite guidance being available from NISRA, it would seem that little or no attention is paid to that aspect of measuring deprivation.  The guidance is vital to any policy that aims to target rural areas.  The Committee, therefore, recommends that DARD actively engages with DFP to ensure that NISRA is commissioned to undertake a review of the NI multiple deprivation indices to establish how Departments use the indices and what importance they place on the guidance for rural areas.</p><p>Another issue that gave concern to the Committee was the responsibility for rural issues and rural proofing.  During the evidence sessions, the Committee heard that there was a general perception that rural issues are the remit of DARD.  Whilst it may seem appropriate for DARD to take the lead on rural issues, it was felt that it is not the only Department with responsibility for that area.  Stakeholders agreed that Departments were not working with the rural White Paper and that their policies were not rural-proofed.  The Committee has, therefore, recommended that DARD commences an evaluation of the level of consideration that other Departments give to rural issues in respect of policy, services and resources, and it is calling for the development of an interdepartmental working group to monitor that.  We look forward to hearing the outcome of that recommendation.</p><p>Another concern for the Committee that emerged during the review was the intention of the Department to move &#163;1&#183;7 million from resource to capital and the requirement for it to be spent within one year.  Whilst the Department has justified that budget move by stating that it will provide more sustainable development, the Committee is of the opinion that capital is generally more difficult to spend and is not necessarily where the need is.  That is why we have recommended that the Minister rethinks that budget allocation.  As a Committee, we remain to be convinced that that allocation of capital funding is the best option for the TRPSI programme.</p><p>Finally, there has been a great deal of apprehension around the creation of the new super-councils.  Several stakeholders told the Committee that they fear that the new councils will not have a rural focus or make rural issues a priority.  There has been considerable interest in the community planning process, and there is an expectation that rural areas will not be overlooked, but concern exists around budgets and funding for community groups.  Again, the people on the ground are best placed to advise where and how any funding is best placed.  The Committee is recommending that the Department proactively engages with the new councils to ensure that rural issues are a priority and that they are taken into account &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Tackling Rural Poverty and Social Inclusion Framework"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>&#8212; when it comes to policy development in rural and farming communities.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Tackling Rural Poverty and Social Inclusion Framework"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>While the Minister is answering questions about my constituency, can he let us know whether he will prioritise a new build for Markethill High School in County Armagh?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Education: St Joseph's High School, Crossmaglen: New Build"}, {"date": "2015-02-17", "body": "<p>In March 2011, the Assembly agreed to a legislative consent motion on the Public Bodies Act 2011, which allowed certain public bodies to be dissolved or abolished.  One such body is the Advisory Committee on Pesticides, the ACP.  The ACP is a non-departmental body established under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 to give independent advice to government on all matters relating to pesticides.  The function of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides is to provide independent advice to government through the four devolved Administrations.  Its key output is about whether a pesticide or an active substance is approved for use.  It examines whether it is safe, whether controls can be put in place to make it safe and so on.  Essentially, it is the key advisory body on pesticides policy and safety.</p><p>The Advisory Committee on Pesticides covers England, Scotland and Wales, and the Advisory Committee on Pesticides NI covers Northern Ireland.  In practice, the same body of experts has been appointed for both, meaning that there is a single committee serving both legal entities.  The Government have proposed to abolish both those ACPs and replace them with an expert committee of DEFRA.  That committee would work for the UK Departments, including the Food Standards Agency and the devolved Administrations, including DARD.  The new expert committee on pesticides will be formed and operate to terms of reference agreed by DEFRA and the devolved Administrations.</p><p>The process will see the abolition of the committee and will result in its re-establishment as an expert committee, meaning that the committee will be under a different name and status, but its functions and members will remain the same.  The procedure is essentially an administrative change that has no real practical impact on the functions that the committee carries out.  The main outcome expected from the abolishment of the ACPs and replacement with an expert committee is greater transparency and more effective working.  It is considered a non-controversial issue, as it is an administrative change only.</p><p>As part of the process, a UK-wide consultation took place, with DARD advising local stakeholders.  A total of 45 responses were received, with none from Northern Ireland.  As a Committee, we considered the proposal from the Department at the meeting on 9 December 2014 and at the meeting on 13 January 2015.  The information received by the Committee clearly showed that the abolition will have minimal effect in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, the Committee is content for the Department to proceed in seeking the Assembly's consent to the Public Bodies (Abolition of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides) Order 2015.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Public Bodies (Abolition of the Advisory Committees on Pesticides) Order 2015: Assembly Consent Motion"}, {"date": "2015-02-16", "body": "<p>The Agriculture and Rural Development Committee, like other Committees, takes regular briefs on financial and budgetary issues from the Department as part of its role to scrutinise the Department.  I have, on behalf of my Committee, expressed the Committee views on the Budget for 2015 to 2016 a number of times in the last few weeks.  So, Members will not be surprised that there is very little in this speech that is new.</p><p>As always, the Committee position is that, as far as it is concerned, one of the main remits of DARD is to pay grants to farmers.  By that I mean the payment of EU grants, particularly what used to be called the single farm payment, but which, since 2015, is the basic payment.  In the Committee, we count that as the front line, and we want to make sure that that is protected.</p><p>We also count as front line the provision of other services to the wider rural community.  That covers such areas as the rural development programme, the rural White Paper and the tackling rural poverty and social inclusion (TRPSI) framework.</p><p>I just mentioned the TRPSI framework.  As some of you will know, it is a Programme for Government target.  As a Committee, we recently undertook some in-depth scrutiny of the framework and have just produced a paper on it, which we hope to have debated in the Assembly in the near future.  We have a number of recommendations for any successor framework, including one that relates to budget.</p><p>The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development has provided the framework with a budget for the 2015-16 year that is more heavily weighted to capital than previous.  As a Committee, we had no major issue with that, but we did have some minor concerns.  We feel that the Department must acknowledge that the funding for the TRPSI framework has been largely resource-based and that, without doubt, engagement with the stakeholders will be required to ensure that suitable capital projects can be identified and that such projects can be delivered within the framework.</p><p>As with all aspects of government, the DARD budget may be challenging in the next few years.  Tomorrow, we will be hearing from Agri-Food Strategy Board (AFBI), an arm's length body of DARD.  From what I have seen, its budget will be very difficult.  The Committee will take oral evidence from AFBI tomorrow.  I have had a quick glance through the papers that it has provided, and they do not make happy reading.  AFBI has a key role to play in the industry, and its research is essential in growing our farming and agrifood industries.  AFBI also has an important role on disease control for both plants and animals and is heavily involved with both bovine TB and bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD).  However, like every publicly funded body, it is going to have to cut its cloth to match the new reality of decreasing budgets.  The role of the ARD Committee will be to ensure that the AFBI budget and work programme is aligned to that of DARD and to the farming and industry priorities.  DARD has already told us that it needs to shed around 300 jobs to meet its payroll costs, and AFBI is looking to shed slightly under that figure.  Between the two, that is a massive cut in jobs.</p><p>When the Committee took evidence from the Minister and her officials in January, she outlined that savings of &#163;29&#183;9 million are required in one financial year.  She also outlined her five key priorities.  Those priorities are the successful implementation of CAP reform; the implementation of the Going for Growth action plan; the headquarters relocation programme; continued support for the TRPSI programme; and continued investment in flood alleviation work.  In this coming year, the Committee will keep a close eye on those five priorities and make sure that the budget is aligned to those priorities.</p><p>We will continue to watch and make sure that services are delivered as efficiently and as cost-effectively as possible.  For example, I outlined previously concerns that the Committee had around the Northern Ireland food animal information system (NIFAIS) programme.  This is a large-scale IT project and its costs, both resource and capital, are substantial.  We have had a closed-session briefing on that and had a very frank and open discussion with DARD officials.  We also commissioned some research, which helped us to compare and contrast it with similar projects in other countries, including New Zealand and Canada.  I cannot speak for the rest of the Committee members, but I feel a little more assured that, despite the high risk factors and the consequence to our industry if it all goes wrong, DARD is working hard to make NIFAIS a success.</p><p>As we debate the Budget Bill today, I will finish by saying that we know that hard times are coming, but the Committee will continue to play its part to ensure that the cuts and savings are made in line with priority services and that the front line is protected as much as possible.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Budget Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-09", "body": "<p>As Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, I will represent that Committee's views.</p><p>The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, like other Committees, takes regular briefings on financial and budgetary issues from the Department as part of its role to scrutinise it.  The Committee, in its response to the Department of Finance and Personnel to the budget proposals, stated that any cuts and savings in the budget should have a minimal impact on the farmer and the wider rural community.  The Committee is adamant that a reduced impact on front-line services to farmers and rural dwellers is given high priority and that those should not be affected to any great level, as that would be detrimental.</p><p>Bearing that in mind, the Committee was anxious to hear the budget proposals for the Department. Indeed, our most recent briefing was held on 27 January 2015, when the Minister and her officials briefed the Committee on the 2015-16 budget.  The Minister outlined that savings of &#163;29&#183;9 million are required in one financial year, and taking that into consideration, she outlined her five key priorities.  Those are the successful implementation of CAP reform; the implementation of the Going for Growth action plan; the HQ relocation programme; continued support for the tackling rural poverty and social isolation (TRPSI) programme; and continued investment in flood alleviation work.</p><p>The Committee noted that with CAP reform, there will be significant changes for farmers, some of which are causing anxiety and distress.  Farmers are being encouraged to submit claims online, the intention of which is to process and pay out more efficiently and promptly.  The Minister advised the Committee that, in recognition of the difficulties surrounding the payment process, she has allocated &#163;6&#183;3 million to support that work, in addition to &#163;0&#183;3 million capital investment in IT systems.</p><p>One of the concerns of the Committee is that, despite that investment in new IT systems, there may be a reduction in the number of staff available to process payments. Given that there are cuts proposed across the wider public sector and the impact that voluntary redundancies may have on staffing levels, the Committee seeks assurance that payments to farmers, which are a vital source of income for them in running their business, will not be affected by staffing issues.  Indeed, the Committee will seek assurances that essential business across the Department as a whole will not be severely impacted.  Given that staff who have a wealth of knowledge and years of experience are the people most likely to apply for redundancies, the Committee is keen to hear how that will be managed by the Department.</p><p>The Committee heard that there will be an additional &#163;1 million of funding available to support farmers in order to assist in the implementation of the farm business improvement scheme.  The funding aims to support farmers in the decision-making process and to help them to develop a business plan.  The Minister advised that her Department was keen to get the scheme up and running very soon.  The Committee is due to receive a briefing on that very soon, and we look forward to hearing the finer details and the outworking of the scheme.</p><p>The Committee noted that the Minister had allocated a further &#163;1 million of resource funding to the HQ relocation project, bringing the total resource and capital funding budgets to &#163;5&#183;4 million in 2015-16.  The Committee is keen to see the business case for that project sooner rather than later.  There is also concern about whether, with many of the DARD functions moving to other locations &#8212; for example, fisheries to Downpatrick and forestry to Fermanagh &#8212; a move to Ballykelly, with the costs associated with that, is the most prudent thing to do. Given the recent announcement of the Executive decision to reduce the number of Departments, we query how the relocation plan will stack up, given the additional pressures that will now be placed on Departments and the current financial position.</p><p>We were glad to hear that the Minister has maintained the &#163;4&#183;7 million funding for the tackling rural poverty and social isolation (TRPSI) programme.  The programme has been subject to a Committee review recently, and we heard about the effective impact that it has in rural and farming communities. However, as a Committee, we have expressed concern about why there has been provision for &#163;1&#183;7 million towards capital.  Again, the Committee will be interested to hear what the proposals for the capital spend will be, especially when it has to be spent within the very tight timescale of one year.</p><p>Given the range of cuts outlined across Departments, the Committee is concerned that Departments will not be able to commit to their actions in the rural White Paper.  The Committee seeks assurance from the Department that everything possible is being done to ensure that any rural-proofing decisions subject to budget constraints are made without any disadvantage to the rural community.</p><p>The Committee is pleased that the Minister has considered flood alleviation as one of her priorities.  Everyone is all too aware of the devastation that flooding can cause; therefore, an allocation of &#163;8&#183;5 million of capital funding is to be welcomed.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Supply Resolution for the 2014-15 Spring Supplementary Estimates"}, {"date": "2015-02-03", "body": "<p>Given that pig prices in Northern Ireland are running at about 20p per kilo less than the current UK price, does the Minister accept that that leaves our producers at a big disadvantage and that it is, therefore, unacceptable?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Agriculture and Rural Development: Pig Meat Market Price"}, {"date": "2015-02-02", "body": "<p>I do not think that anyone will disagree with any of the sentiments contained in the Chairman's motion before the House today, especially given the sterling service that our further and higher education establishments have provided through the years.  In my constituency, the Southern Regional College is a treasured local provider across a number of sites.  I know that, from my time in Armagh council, we were very aware of the achievements, commitment and determination of the FE sector to continue to grow.</p><p>When one considers that three out of every four students who enter the FE sector gain a full qualification, it is clear that the structures and systems in place across our complement of providers are working and ensuring that our students are attaining and advancing.  That is very positive for our economic growth.</p><p>We have heard many very positive job announcements in recent times, led by our hardworking Enterprise, Trade and Investment Minister.  When a company spokesperson is asked, \"Why Northern Ireland?\", the response has been consistent, \"Because our workforce has the skill sets required, the knowledge and the experience.\"  Do not underestimate the power of that message in unlocking yet further opportunities in attracting further inward investment.  That being said, there is obviously a great importance attached to maintaining such a solid reputation.  Our economic recovery and the need to continue to grow our economy is firmly attached to the performance and resources available to our further and higher education sector, which can underpin our future economic stability.</p><p>To further illustrate the contribution of our universities and FE colleges, it is interesting and encouraging to note that the knowledge economy index ranks the region of Northern Ireland with the second highest knowledge growth in the UK.  Take the amazing research being undertaken at Queen's, which has been consistently ranked world leading, with 76% of work either three or four star in its value.  Those statistics are hard fought and represent a massive commitment by our students and staff, who continually strive to achieve ever higher standards.  The key to the success of our further and higher education providers also lies in maintaining the very broad diversity of curriculum that is offered.  That enables a wide variety of interests and skills to be developed.  Many of our institutions maintain very close links with local businesses and industries, enabling our colleges and universities to better respond in their provision of bespoke training and skills development to match the ever-developing world in which we live.</p><p>The current exercise on the reorganisation of Executive Departments will be an important piece of work for ensuring that cross-cutting roles and responsibilities are effectively brought under the jurisdiction and responsibility of one new Department.  Having key DETI and DEL functions combined in a new Department will, I feel, assist in focusing attention on issues and areas of greatest need.  Whilst there is a lot of work still to do on any such proposal, it should hopefully lead to significant and positive changes.  In the meantime, there remains a need to support our further and higher education sector, and, as contributors have already pointed out, the knock-on effects of maintaining a top-level complement of colleges and universities will ensure that we continue to grow our economy and attract quality inward investment.

I start by saying that the ARD Committee has just left a meeting with the Minister at 2.00 pm today to discuss the DARD consultation on the final budget allocations for DARD.  I shall therefore outline a few issues that the Committee explored with the Minister today.</p><p>First, I want to raise the issue of the DARD relocation project.  It is proposed that, in the final 2015-16 Budget, DARD will receive an additional &#163;1 million of resource for its HQ relocation.  From a written briefing that the Committee received from the Department on the Budget I note that the consultation responses supported the relocation of Forest Service, fisheries division and Rivers Agency but were divided on the relocation of DARD headquarters to Ballykelly.  Those opposed to the move appear to have the opinion that the decentralisation of jobs should not be prioritised, given the constrained and difficult financial position.  There is now another factor to consider in this, and that is the recent announcement in the media regarding the decision by the Executive to reduce the number of Departments and the possibility that some functions of DOE will move to DARD.  As a Committee, we raised this very issue in our response to the draft Budget and discussed it with the Minister earlier today.</p><p>The Committee noted that farmers are subject to a range of field inspections relating to a wide range of subject areas by both DARD and other government officials.  The Committee was of the opinion that there is an opportunity to drive efficiencies in the area with other organisations and bodies with an inspecting role, such as NIEA, having their functions transferred to DARD.</p><p>The Committee will want to know whether those proposed transfers of functions will be taken account of in the DARD relocation programme.</p><p>Another further change to the DARD budget is the additional &#163;1 million of resource funding that was received for Going for Growth.  My understanding is that most of the allocation will go to the farm business improvement scheme and that the focus will be on helping farmers to complete the business planning process.  As the final farm business improvement scheme will involve the possibility of a grant of up to a quarter of a million pounds, the Committee will want to see proper preparation and strong planning by DARD and farmers.  That is why I have proposed that we hear more about that aspect from DARD officials in the near future.</p><p>I also note that DARD has received &#163;1 million in resources from the change fund to allow for integration of control information for EU area-based schemes.  Recently, the Committee was pleased to see information that indicated that the disallowance penalties imposed by the EU had been reduced, in part due to the better controls that have been put in place by DARD.  That is another step in getting our controls up to an acceptable level, thus reducing the substantial disallowance penalties that were imposed by EU auditors.</p><p>The most important issue for the Committee is that front-line services to farmers and wider rural communities should not be affected.  The Committee indicated that at least a continuation of the current level of service regarding payments to farmers was its first and main priority.  In exploring that further, the Committee questioned the Minister on the proposals for staff reductions and received assurances that the reduction in staff numbers would not affect the payment timetable.</p><p>I mentioned staff numbers, and there has been much discussion about the Stormont House Agreement and the reduction in Civil Service posts.  DARD has set itself a target of achieving 300 fewer jobs this year, and the Committee had some concerns about, first, its ability to achieve that level of reductions in one year and, secondly, its lack of planning for what would happen if it did not achieve that.  DARD's original plan was to lose 300 staff and save &#163;5&#183;6 million.  I raised that point with the Minister when we met earlier.</p><p>The Committee noted that administration costs had risen between 2011-12 and 2014-15.  When the Committee questioned officials on that, it noted that the increase appeared to be attributable to two causes:  increasing pay inflation and pension costs; and increasing staff levels.  The Committee agreed that it was not content with that and would urge the Minister to ensure that, notwithstanding the reduction of 300 staff posts, a very close watching brief be kept on administration costs to ensure that they are reduced immediately.</p><p>The Committee noted that the Minister has confirmed that the tackling rural poverty and social isolation programme, as with the other PFG targets, would remain a priority.  The Committee considered the budget cut that the programme will be faced with in 2015-16 and noted that there was provision for &#163;1&#183;7 million of capital funding.  The Committee questioned the usefulness of capital funding in that programme.</p><p>Given the range of cuts expected across the wider public sector, the Committee encourages the Department to ensure that other Departments remain committed to the actions in the rural White Paper and that those other Departments, in making their budget decisions, take rural proofing into account.</p><p>The final major issue that I want to cover is the new IT system:  the Northern Ireland food animal information system (NIFAIS).  The Committee has had a full and frank discussion on NIFAIS with officials on a number of occasions and made its view very well known.  The Committee is not convinced that the NIFAIS programme, in its current format, represents value for money, and it remains to be convinced that what is proposed by DARD is not a Rolls-Royce model.  I was interested to note that the Committee's concerns are shared by others and that the cost of the NIFAIS programme was raised during the DARD consultation.  We raised that issue with the Minister earlier and urged her to revisit the programme to ensure that it is fit for purpose and does not have unnecessary elements.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Budget 2015-16"}, {"date": "2015-01-20", "body": "<p>As a representative for Newry and Armagh, I have to say that Daisy Hill Hospital is a very important and vital resource for thousands of residents across Newry and the surrounding districts.  Daisy Hill Hospital is a cherished facility that has provided a superb service for decades.  Therefore, it is easy to understand why the public would be concerned at any potential loss of service.</p><p>There have been many concerns raised of late regarding the future of services at Daisy Hill, and the latest plans to see stroke services at Daisy Hill relocated to a specialist unit at Craigavon have created anxiety.</p><p>For someone living in Newry or the surrounding district who has suffered a stroke, Craigavon is a considerable distance away, especially in the already difficult situation for elderly people who are leaving their home and are unsure of how things will unfold.  There are also issues for the family in travelling, visiting and supporting the stroke victim.  The changes proposed for Daisy Hill's stroke services are significant.  While they are not immediate, the changes represent a significant shift in provision, and, in reality, it is the physical removal of a very important resource.</p><p>I recognise and welcome the fact that, in the Health and Social Care estate, Daisy Hill Hospital continues to feature strongly as a key provider of care in the region.  That is illustrated by the investment made in the 24-hour emergency department and a consultant obstetric unit, and includes other significant upgrades in the building.  Plans have also been proposed for the centralisation of paediatric services at the hospital.  So, it is clear to me that the Department sees Daisy Hill as continuing to play a key role in providing care across a number of specialisms.</p><p>The Minister represents South Down, so he will be very well aware of the concerns expressed by all Members this evening, and I, too, will be interested in his views on the subjects raised and to hear his vision for Daisy Hill in the future.  I know that he will take on board my concerns on the issue of the relocation of stroke services and the views of people in the Newry area in response to the phased change.</p><p>The Minister is facing unprecedented financial pressures on his available spend for health.  That has been made very clear in recent weeks.  The pressures on the health service budget are significant.  I feel that it is important for the Minister to refer to the wider financial picture in his remarks to the House.</p><p>The Transforming Your Care strategy is also at the heart of the matter.

I welcomed and carefully noted the concerns and representations that Members expressed in the early part of the debate.  I particularly welcome the opportunity to debate the future funding of water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland.  I also welcome that the Ulster Unionist Party amendment has been accepted by, I hope, a majority of Members who spoke and, indeed, a majority of the parties in the Assembly.  I think that that underlines that the funding of water and sewerage services is a cross-cutting strategic issue with significant public expenditure implications.  The Executive have given a commitment that, for households, they will ensure no additional water charges during this Programme for Government.</p><p>That commitment means that my Department provides over 75% of NI Water&#8217;s revenue through the payment of subsidy from the public expenditure system; 20% comes from the non-domestic sector, that is, businesses, industry and so on; and DRD pays the remaining 5% for roads drainage works that NI Water carries out.  The most recent published figures are for the year 2013-14, when NI Water was paid &#163;275&#183;4 million in the absence of domestic water charging.  In addition, &#163;2&#183;2 million was paid for the septic tank emptying subsidy, which is unregulated.</p><p>In giving a commitment that there will be no additional water charges for households, the Executive must also accept the consequences of that decision.  NI Water&#8217;s non-departmental public body (NDPB) status means that it does not have the freedoms and flexibilities normally available to a company.  It cannot use reserves to deal with unexpected costs, it cannot raise its own capital and it has no end-year flexibility, so it must manage its capital and resource budgets to ensure no overspend and minimum underspend.  That is inefficient and leads to stop/start contracting.  The Executive must in turn provide NI Water with adequate resources to meet its future funding requirements.</p><p>As a result of increased investment since 2000, levels of service have improved significantly across nearly all service areas.  Customer service levels have improved dramatically in the last decade, but that means that NI Water has a growing asset base that has to be maintained.  We therefore cannot rest on our laurels.</p><p>In November 2012, I brought a paper to the Executive that set out issues and risks associated with the governance and funding of water and sewerage services.  The Executive decided to remit those issues to the Budget review group for consideration.  My officials subsequently prepared a detailed briefing for the Budget review group that set out a number of options for future funding arrangements, together with more detail about the risks involved in continuing with the current system.  The paper highlighted some of the continuing difficulties with the current funding arrangements and the emerging pressure on NI Water's capital expenditure budget.  The Budget review group's consideration of these complex issues is ongoing.</p><p>In the meantime, the legislation that permits the Executive to provide subsidy for water and sewerage services in lieu of funding by charging expires in 2016.  I instructed my officials to bring forward legislation to extend my Department's power to provide a subsidy on behalf of the Executive to NI Water until 2017, and to take the power to extend this further by subordinate legislation.  This enabling power does not prejudge the Executive's consideration of the funding of NI Water in that period, but will ensure that there is certainty about funding for NI Water's operating expenditure while the Executive consider those future funding arrangements.  By taking these actions, I have sought to ensure that the Executive's policy of not introducing domestic charges can continue.</p><p>The motion calls on me, as Minister, to prioritise within my budget to ensure that sufficient investment is in place to maintain properly the local water infrastructure.  I remind Members that NI Water operates within an independent regulatory system where its targets and investment priorities are set by the Utility Regulator and agreed as part of the price control process.  The Utility Regulator benchmarks NI Water against the water and sewerage companies in England and Wales and builds in an efficiency challenge for operating costs in order to ensure value for money for customers.  NI Water and the Utility Regulator agree how much revenue NI Water requires to carry out its operations in order to achieve required outputs and investment for the best value for customers.</p><p>The Utility Regulator published its price control determination for NI Water for the period 2015-2021 on 12 December 2014.  The determination is the regulator's assessment of NI Water's revenue requirements over the six-year period in the context of meeting targets that are contained within my Department's social and environmental guidance, as approved by the Executive.  The ministerial social and environmental guidance sets out the key social and environmental policies for water and sewerage services for the period 2015-2021.  The key priorities that are set out in the guidance are to maintain and improve our high standards of water and sewerage services; to continue to comply with our environmental obligations; to develop sustainable solutions to the challenges that lie ahead, like climate change and flooding; and to enable economic growth.</p><p>The regulator has told NI Water to reduce its total revenue requirement by &#163;89&#183;3 million from its business plan figure of &#163;2&#183;43 billion for PC15, resulting in a requirement for &#163;2&#183;34 billion during the period.  The final determination also provided for &#163;1 billion in capital investment, which is a constrained budget based on the figures that are included in the social and economic guidance.  Of this figure, &#163;556 million has been allocated to the repair and replacement of assets, while &#163;446 million has been allocated to deliver new and upgraded treatment works and other outputs that are prioritised with stakeholders to enhance services.</p><p>The regulator has determined that NI Water requires &#163;155 million for 2015-16, but the constraints that are placed upon my Department mean that only &#163;140 million can be made available to fund the company for year 1 of the PC15 period.</p><p>Turning to the resource position at the draft Budget stage, the proposed allocation was some &#163;15 million short against the regulator's assessment.  That was mainly due to a massive increase in the company's rates bill as a result of the recent non-domestic rates revaluation.  NI Water has to certify to the regulator that it has sufficient funding to carry out its regulated activities.  The draft Budget allocation would have made it virtually impossible for the company to comply with its legal duties and obligations under the licence.  To enable NI Water to meet its legal obligations, I have significantly addressed the shortfall through the allocation of a further &#163;10 million, bringing its resource allocation to &#163;109&#183;2 million for 2015-16, thus reducing the shortfall to some &#163;5 million.</p><p>I anticipate the additional resource funding going a long way towards enabling Northern Ireland Water to mitigate any significant deterioration in water quality or waste water compliance, which appeared to be inevitable at the draft Budget stage.</p><p>A significant risk remains.  Northern Ireland Water is still &#163;5 million short of the budget cover that the Utility Regulator recommended, and it will need to absorb that shortfall.  There is no funding to cover unforeseen events.  I remind Members that the current funding issues relate solely to the 2015-16 budget, while the current price control covers the period from April 2015 to March 2021.  A long-term funding solution therefore needs to be agreed if NI Water is to be provided with the assurance that it needs to plan for the future.  My Department will make robust bids to the Executive for funding throughout the 2015-16 monitoring rounds to mitigate potential negative impacts on customer service, such as incidence of low pressure, supply interruptions, pollution incidents and out-of-sewer flooding.  Given the level of funding, Northern Ireland Water and the Utility Regulator are still seeking to review the required output targets in the PC15 business plan.</p><p>Having explained how NI Water's targets and funding requirements are independently developed through the regulatory process, I now want to address the issue of prioritising my Department's budget to ensure that sufficient investment takes place.  On 3 March, I made a statement on the implications of the 2015-16 Budget allocation for my Department.  Members will be aware that I am facing &#163;60 million of pressures for next year, and the scale of reduction required to meet that cannot be delivered without there being an impact on core services.  I have been working intensively with officials to determine how best to allocate the limited resources that are available to me.  My Department delivers key water, transport and road services.  The population relies on our services 24 hours a day.  I have sought to protect, as far as possible, NI Water and Translink from the worst impact of the reduced budget.  I have had no choice but to move money from roads to NI Water, because otherwise the company would have been unable to meet its basic legal obligations.  NI Water may still not be able to meet all the public's expectations of it with the remaining shortfall in its budget.  That has come about as a result of the massive rates revaluation, so there is no link to the levels of services provided by the company.</p><p>I continue to welcome Members' suggestions on how we can continue to fund water and sewerage services to the same level in the face of constrained public expenditure.  It is ultimately a matter for the Executive to decide the future funding and governance arrangements for NI Water.  Therefore, I ask that the House reach a consensus to ensure that NI Water is adequately funded to meets its future funding requirements.</p><p>I will now deal with contributions made during the debate.  Mr Clarke, speaking as a Member from the Democratic Unionist Party, acknowledged that he and his party would be supporting the Ulster Unionist Party's amendment.  It is fair to say that there was a bit of action in the exchanges between Mr Clarke in particular and Members from the Alliance Party.  It is the season in which we expect that.</p><p>Mr Cree proposed what is in my view a very sensible and appropriate amendment.  He made the point that the deferment of household water charges is a good example of devolution working, and I very much subscribe to that view.</p><p>I am sorry that Mr Lynch is not in the Chamber.  He indicated that he will support the motion.  I am not clear what Sinn F&#233;in's view on the amendment is, but no doubt that will transpire.</p><p>Mr Dallat confirmed that the SDLP is against water charging.  He referred to the \"wasted years\".</p><p>I detected in Mr Lyttle's contribution something of a political retreat in Alliance Party policy.  There was certainly movement in the air.  Whilst that is welcome, it is interesting, and the timing of it is perhaps not lost either.</p><p>Mr Byrne indicated that he did not &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>I am grateful to the Member for her topical question.

Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I beg to move</p><p class=\"italic\">That this Assembly approves the report of the Committee on Procedures [NIA 232/11-16] on its inquiry into the extent to which Standing Orders should permit the Attorney General for Northern Ireland (AGNI) to participate in proceedings of the Assembly:  Part 1 &#8212; impartiality of the Office of AGNI, registration of interests and participation of the AGNI in Assembly proceedings in respect of areas other than Statutory Rules.</p><p>This report is slightly unusual, because it covers only part of a Committee inquiry. This is necessary because of the complexity of the issues being considered and the care and diligence with which the Committee has approached the inquiry.</p><p>The inquiry is on section 25 of the Justice Act 2002.  This permits the Attorney General to participate in proceedings of the Assembly, but only to the extent permitted by Standing Orders and it expressly forbids him from voting.   The provision has been in existence for some time.  However, there has been no interpretation of the legislation in practice, despite predecessor Committees having wrestled with the matter.  During the 2007 to 2011 mandate, both the Procedures Committee and the Committee on Standards and Privileges examined the matter.  However, no resolution was reached by the end of that mandate, and the matter passed into the legacy report and then to the present Committee on Procedures.</p><p>At first glance, this seemed a fairly straightforward matter.  Closer examination of models used for law officers in other jurisdictions showed that it was not.  Some parts of the models were defined in legislation; others arose from constitutional convention, custom and practice; but they had all been adapted to suit specific devolution settlements and/or unique legal arrangements in the different areas.  Although the Committee looked at modifying existing models, it soon became clear that this would not work, the reason being the statutory requirement that the role of AGNI be non-political.  This is not true of any other legislatures examined.</p><p>Having recognised this, the Committee began to examine the role and devise a model from scratch.  Its first step was to identify aspects of the role where participation in Assembly proceedings might be of benefit, either by providing enhanced scrutiny or added value to proceedings, both Committee and plenary.  If any such areas were identified, the Committee went on to examine whether such participation needed to be codified in Standing Orders.</p><p>Five main areas of work were identified as worthy of further consideration; however, a number of options for participation in each area were found, and this resulted in an extensive matrix that needed to be evaluated.  The Committee agreed that a strategic approach to assessing them was required.  To achieve this, the Committee discussed a set of key principles, which, it agreed, would be used to underpin its evaluation of options.</p><p>As these principles are detailed in the report, I will mention only one as an example.  This is the first and suggests that, as the AGNI is not a duly elected Member of the Assembly, he should not automatically be afforded the privileges of that office.  Applying that principle meant that a number of options that afforded the AGNI an automatic right to appear in plenary or Committee could be discounted.  Applying the agreed principles as a baseline reduced the matrix to a more manageable size, and the Committee moved on to more detailed evaluation.</p><p>The five work areas considered are detailed in the report, but, briefly, they cover the impartiality of the office and the registration of interests; answering Assembly questions; the referral of Bills after Final Stage; the scrutiny of the AGNI's annual report; and scrutiny of statutory rules brought by the AGNI.  The first four are the basis of the report before the House today.  The last is still being considered and will be brought to the Assembly as part 2 of the report in due course.  For today, though, I will restrict further remarks to a brief outline of the areas covered in the report and the reasons for its recommendations.</p><p>The first area is titled \"impartiality of the office and registration of interests\".  No discussion of that would be complete without mentioning the work of the Committee on Standards and Privileges on it.  The Standards and Privileges Committee considered the matter in detail during the last mandate.  It revisited its findings in this mandate and confirmed to the Committee on Procedures that they were still valid.  After consideration of its conclusions, the Committee on Procedures was content to endorse the findings and, therefore, has recommended that a distinct Standing Order be drafted to cover the matter.</p><p>No doubt the Chairperson of the Committee on Standards and Privileges will wish to speak to that aspect of the report in more detail, so I will restrict my remarks to a brief outline of the proposed requirements of the Standing Order.  The AGNI would be required to register and declare interests in the same way as a Member.  He would be prohibited from advocating on any matter on behalf of anyone else for payment or benefit.  If an alleged breach were to occur, the Assembly's Commissioner for Standards would investigate it.  The report from such an investigation would be passed to the Committee on Standards and Privileges, which would decide whether to uphold the complaint and impose appropriate sanction if required.</p><p>The second work area concerns answering Assembly questions.  The Committee identified several options but discarded a number that did not comply with underpinning principles or that posed significant reputational risk.  For example, if the AGNI attended plenary, he could be asked questions on matters that were sub judice.  The AGNI then either could not or would not answer.  That could be perceived as an Assembly being powerless to hold the AGNI to account or that the AGNI was being unhelpful or lacking transparency.</p><p>The Committee finally agreed that the risk outweighed any perceived benefit and decided to recommend against setting up an oral Question Time for the AGNI.  It considered the option of questions for written answer, but it recognised that, as no memorandum of understanding was in place, setting response times and rules would be difficult.  The Committee also recognised that, as nothing prevented the AGNI answering questions that were sent directly to him at present, there was nothing to be gained by making provision in Standing Orders in that regard.</p><p>The Committee then considered the power given to the AGNI in legislation to consider and refer Bills after Final Stage for a decision on legislative competence.  In that category, too, the Committee identified a reputational risk in calling the AGNI to plenary.  For example, if the AGNI was asked inappropriate questions, it could be perceived as the Assembly questioning the AGNI's statutory right to refer Bills.  Mitigating that risk from the Chair would be very difficult in practice, therefore the option was discounted.</p><p>The Committee also looked at what benefit was derived from codifying the AGNI's attendance at Committee in that regard.  However, it agreed that such a Standing Order would merely formalise a process that was already permissible.  Therefore, it recommends that no change to Standing Orders be made on that.  The Committee gave brief consideration to whether any benefit was to be gained by codifying a role for the AGNI in giving views on Bills prior to Final Stage.  However, it was agreed that the AGNI's role in advising the Executive created a conflict of interests, and the matter was set aside.</p><p>The last area covered in that section of the report is the AGNI's annual report.  The AGNI is required by law to produce an annual report.  It must be submitted to the First Minister and deputy First Minister, who are required to lay it in the Assembly.  That means that a copy of the report is placed in the Assembly Business Office, where it is available to all Members.  It is lodged in the public domain only when the AGNI publishes it on his website.  The Committee recognised similar reputational risks attached to plenary appearances as before.  However, it believed that some benefit existed in creating a Standing Order to facilitate the AGNI attending a nominated Committee when the report is laid.  This should be only at the Committee's request but would allow an opportunity for the AGNI to make a statement and/or answer questions on the content of the report.  The Committee recommends that the nominated Committee should be the Committee for Justice.</p><p>Obviously, I could go into a lot more detail, and I am sure that Members are delighted that I am not going to.  However, I will bring my remarks to a close by stressing again the detailed consideration that has been given to all the options identified.  In making recommendations of preferred outcomes, the Committee is content that those outcomes are in keeping with the key principles that it agreed at the start.  It is also confident that the mechanisms that have been recommended protect the integrity of the institutions and individuals involved.  I am therefore content to commend the report to the Assembly.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Attorney General's Participation in Proceedings of the Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee on Procedures Report"}, {"date": "2015-03-10", "body": "<p>Gabhaim bu&#237;ochas leis an Aire go dt&#237; seo.

The first relates to topical questions; the other two relate to the election of a Speaker during a mandate.  This may seem a strange combination, but it is purely for the sake of expediency, rather than any link between them.</p><p>The first motion relates to Standing Order 20A(4).  On 9 December 2014, the Assembly approved the Committee's report on the review of topical questions.  One of the recommendations in the report was that, as for listed oral questions, the first topical question may not be from a Member of the same party as the Minister.  Today's motion will give effect to that recommendation by amending Standing Orders accordingly.</p><p>The other two motions relate to the election of a Speaker during a mandate.  Standing Order 4 currently sets out the procedure for the election of a Speaker at a meeting of a new Assembly but is silent on the procedure to be followed if a Speaker indicates his intention to resign during an Assembly term.  The proposed amendment will insert a new Standing Order 4A to address this, by describing how the Speaker resigns and clarifying the procedures for the election of a new Speaker during an Assembly term.  The proposed amendment also commits the outgoing Speaker to take the Chair for the proceedings to elect a successor.</p><p>The final motion relates to Standing Order 6, which already sets out the procedure to be followed if the office of Speaker becomes vacant during an Assembly term, but does not specify who would take the Chair for the purposes of that election.  The proposed amendment will insert additional text into Standing Order 6 to make it clear that an Acting Speaker takes the Chair in these circumstances.  The amendments to Standing Orders 4 and 6 will address the gaps in Standing Orders and clarify the procedures for the election of a Speaker during a mandate.</p><p>In closing, a Cheann Comhairle, Mr Speaker, the three motions before the House are straightforward &#8212; famous last words &#8212; and on behalf of the Committee on Procedures, I commend them to the House.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Standing Orders 20A(4)/4/6: Amendments"}], "title": "", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2011-05-09 13:07:07", "person_id": "13809", "entered_reason": "election", "full_name": "Gerry Kelly", "member_id": "90423", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Sinn F\u00e9in", "constituency": "Belfast North"}, {"left_reason": "dissolution", "first_name": "Gerry", "last_name": "Kelly", "left_house": "2011-03-24", "title": "", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2011-03-28 17:40:16", "person_id": "13809", "entered_reason": "election", "full_name": "Gerry Kelly", "member_id": "90291", "entered_house": "2007-03-09", "party": "Sinn F\u00e9in", "constituency": "Belfast North"}, {"left_reason": "dissolution", "first_name": "Gerry", "last_name": "Kelly", "left_house": "2007-01-30", "title": "", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2008-02-26 22:25:24", "person_id": "13809", "entered_reason": "general_election", "full_name": "Gerry Kelly", "member_id": "90184", "entered_house": "2003-11-26", "party": "Sinn F\u00e9in", "constituency": "Belfast North"}, {"left_reason": "general_election", "first_name": "Gerry", "last_name": "Kelly", "left_house": "2003-04-28", "title": "Mr", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2008-02-26 22:25:24", "person_id": "13809", "entered_reason": "general_election", "full_name": "Mr Gerry Kelly", "member_id": "90063", "entered_house": "1998-06-25", "party": "Sinn F\u00e9in", "constituency": "Belfast North"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Danny", "last_name": "Kinahan", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for his comments so far, and I am glad that he will take on board all the objectors' comments.

I take that on board.  I do not remember seeing a letter from him clarifying that, so we will wait and look at it later.  I do not think it changes what we are saying today.</p><p>I hope at the very least that, at the end of this debate, we will have an answer from the First Minister or the deputy First Minister to the Education Minister's alleged written requests, and that they will take action to remove the religious education certificate requirement in some educational employment practices on equality grounds.</p><p>This exchange reminds me of the debate I led in the House nearly two years ago on the related issue of repealing the exemption for teaching appointments in the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 (FETO).  The Ulster Unionist Party believes it is not only time to revisit the teacher exemption issue in teaching employment practices but time to take action and to seriously examine the whole issue of the certificate in religious education requirement for teaching in primary and nursery schools in nearly half the schools in Northern Ireland.</p><p>Regarding the FETO exemption, rather than rehashing the fair employment in teaching debate, which no doubt all Members wishing to contribute today will have revisited, I will in a moment summarise the backstory.</p><p>First, I want to make it absolutely clear that the purpose of my motion is not to have a go at Catholic or any faith-based system of education.  I know how sensitive people can be about these things, and I want again to put on record my appreciation of and, indeed, admiration for, the very many excellent schools within the Catholic maintained sector.  Exam results suggest that they are doing a great deal right, but, in the area of teacher employment, they are getting something wrong.</p><p>We as an Assembly, and OFMDFM as the Department with responsibility for equality, also have a duty to do something about it and to do it now.  In 1976, Parliament exempted employment as a teacher in school from anti-discriminatory legislation.  That is the so-called teachers' exemption.  In 2000, when the European Union provided for general anti-discriminatory law, supposedly to improve labour flexibility in the single market, the UK secured a continuing Northern Ireland opt out in the directive, permitting religious discrimination in teacher appointments.</p><p>The fact that teachers in Northern Ireland are the only occupational group in 27 member states to be legally unprotected should bring a huge degree of shame to our equality laws and should be an absolute priority for the Equality Commission.  It was good to see in an email today a recommendation from the Equality Commission that we should be removing the exception in secondary schools and considering removing it in primary schools.</p><p>The teacher exception, which is now nearly 40 years old, was to be abolished a decade ago, in all secondary schools at least, in the long-forgotten single equality Bill.</p><p>Article 51 of the Council directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000, establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, said that the teachers' exemption should remain.  Two Equality Commission reports of 2000 and 2004 said that the reform was needed.  Reform is long overdue:  the teacher exception should go, and it should go now.</p><p>Interestingly, not long after our previous motion was passed, senior officials from CCMS appeared at the Education Committee.  On 29 May 2013, Jim Clarke, its chief executive, plainly said that CCMS did not rely on, and did not want to see, the continuation of the teacher exemption from fair employment and equality regulations, stating that CCMS:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"would not obstruct or seek to obstruct any removal of that exemption.\"</p><p>He also said that CCMS was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"quite happy for that exemption to be removed\".</p><p>Therefore, why at Stormont has there been a game of pass the parcel when it comes to doing something legislatively about this blatant discrimination?  Two long years have passed, in which I have tabled Assembly questions, as have others.  For example, in March last year, the Minister of Education replied to my question for written answer with the comment:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Article 71 of the Fair Employment and Treatment Order (NI) 1998.  The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister has responsibility for this legislation.\"</p><p>In the same month, I asked the First Minister and the deputy First Minister whether they planned to review the Fair Employment and Treatment Order and bring forward legislation to remove the teacher exception under article 71.  The response was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is a policy issue under discussion between OFMDFM and the Department of Education.  OFMDFM has legislative responsibility for this area however responsibility for developing any policy proposals rests with the Department of Education.\"</p><p>There are other similar examples, but, in summary, there has been buck-passing between OFMDFM and the Department of Education for two years.  Whatever the protestations of the Minister of Education, I get the distinct feeling that someone, somewhere in the heart of government is blocking change.</p><p>To be crystal clear, parents in Northern Ireland have an absolute right, enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, to bring up their children in the religion or belief of their choice, without interference from the state.  However, apart from a handful of independent Christian schools, all schools in Northern Ireland are fully state-funded.  That should, and must, have consequences for autonomy in employment practices.</p><p>This simple question needs to be answered:  should schools be free to select teachers according to their religion?  They cannot in the state-controlled sector, they normally do not in the integrated sector, but they can and do in the Catholic maintained sector, which is fully funded by the state; that is, by taxpayers of all religions and none.</p><p>Regarding the related issue of the certificate in religious education, I know that those involved in the Catholic maintained sector attach great importance to it.  However, there is no obvious reason that all teachers in Catholic maintained primary schools need to have a religious education certificate.  One is not required in Scotland, where there is a similarly strong tradition of Catholic schools.  Many have said that there is a not particularly Catholic or Protestant way in which to teach geography or maths.  I would even add that religious education is a subject to which a common syllabus was agreed between the four main denominations about 20 years ago.  Therefore, in theory at least, even a religious education teacher does not need to be the same religion as the majority of the pupils whom he teaches.  I am not a theologian, but when I hear people talk about and describe a distinct ethos in the Catholic sector, it does not seem to be radically different from a broadly Christian world view, ethical framework, mission statement and outlook &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Teacher Employment: Inequality"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>Does the Minister recognise that the heavy workload on teachers makes it extremely difficult for them to have the time to learn and to teach foreign languages?

We should all wish to live in a society that is open, tolerant, respects the rights of others and promotes equality for all.  You only have to look at TV bulletins to see that, in far too many countries, too many people are forced to live under regimes that have no respect for the rule of law and have scant regard for human rights and equality.  We are fortunate to live in the United Kingdom, where respect for rights and equality before the law are part of our democratic culture.</p><p>The motion is correct in that, since the passing of the Equality Act 2010 at Westminster, we have been out of step with the rest of the United Kingdom in equality protections.  I had expected other Members to go through those who need to be protected and those whom we are protecting them from.  I find it rather strange that we have not gone down that route at all and have hardly touched on what is in the equality Bill.  I too want to move on to other matters, but I point out that an email I got today from the Equality Commission highlights that we in Northern Ireland are behind, especially on disability and women's rights.  Those are the two areas where I thought that we would probably least be concentrating today.  It is sad to see that all being pulled together with a Bill of rights.  It is also sad that, in life, common sense and good manners cannot be allowed to resolve these matters and that we feel that we have to go to legislation.</p><p>The motion also expresses concern that no progress has been made on introducing the single equality Act in this mandate.  The idea of a single equality Act has been around for more than a decade, but, like so much with the process of administration in Northern Ireland, it has ground to a halt.  That is typical of so much of what passes for government in Northern Ireland.  Departments and bureaucrats are excellent at coming forward with strategies and consultations.  They then assist Ministers in drawing up action plans, which lead to task forces and working groups, but, at the end of the day, there is not too much tangible progress in the shape of delivering meaningful change.  The failure to bring forward a single equality Act is yet another manifestation of the dysfunctional nature of OFMDFM.  The people of Northern Ireland deserve better.  Did we not all enter politics to make Northern Ireland a better place?</p><p>I come to the freedom of conscience amendment Bill.

The case involving Ashers bakery is due to be heard in court within the next two weeks.  Whatever one thinks of the rights and wrongs in that specific case, I hope that we can all agree that it should never have come to this.  There should be space in our society for people who wish to live their life according to their religious beliefs.  However, we need to find a way of accommodating the whole range of views.  Freedom of conscience needs to be allowed and respected, as do the rights of citizens and of all other groups.  All too often in this Chamber, there is an arrogance among some who try to force their views on others.  That must cease, and, if we are to set the right example to society, we must all do that.  We live in a democracy and under the rule of law.  When it comes to the Ashers case, let due process take its course.</p><p>When it comes to the amendment, I sincerely believe that we have to find an accommodating range of views.  Freedom of conscience and religion have to be protected.  We must also accept that the rights of citizens and groups to equality of treatment is key in any liberal democracy worthy of that name.  The amendment recognises \"the differing views expressed\" and calls on the Assembly to:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"consider a process to facilitate respectful consideration of these issues\".</p><p>That is why we support the amendment.

For that reason, we tabled our amendment as an interim solution.  There are a number of issues relating to teacher training, but the debate primarily concerns the existence of the teacher exemption in equality legislation.  That is based on article 71 of the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998, and it is OFMDFM's responsibility to initiate legislative change.  A number of Members referred to that.</p><p>As Members outlined, there is an ongoing requirement for a teacher to possess the certificate in religious education in order to work in nursery and primary schools in the Catholic maintained sector.  The crux of the matter is access to the CRE for students at Stranmillis University College and others who may also be affected.  At present, Queen's focuses on PGCEs for secondary-level education, where this is less of an issue.  Ulster University students study for the certificate as part of the training that is facilitated by the Catholic Church.  At St Mary's, provision for the certificate is also part of the course.  However, students of Stranmillis have no direct access to studying for the certificate.  Their only option is to undertake distance learning through the University of Glasgow, which means additional time and resource costs.  A number of Members referred to that.</p><p>The Alliance Party respects the fact that there is a range of sectors in the Northern Ireland education system.  Across those sectors, different ethoses may need to be accommodated.  However, our ideal would be to see a more pluralist certificate that ensures that teachers are trained to work in any context, particularly given the growing diversity in our society, so that those of non-Christian faiths or from no religious background are catered for in our schools system.  However, for now, we seek to address the imbalance by calling on St Mary's, as an interim measure, to provide access to the teaching of the certificate in religious education to students from other teacher-training institutions, including Stranmillis University College.</p><p>I will now refer to Members' comments on our amendment.

Much of the focus of the framework falls under the remit of DETI, including energy supply security and integration of national energy markets.  However, the framework also includes the revision of the EU emissions trading system as part of the legislative framework post 2020.</p><p>The Committee has a particular interest in the greenhouse gas emissions reductions target that is set out in the framework and the plan to introduce a new emission reduction target of at least 40% in 2030 compared with 1990.

The Committee will continue to monitor progress closely in delivering those targets.  The revision of the directive will also require the Department to update associated guidance documents.  The Committee will keep a watching brief on the issue throughout 2015.</p><p>The Committee's second priority relates to the communication on the road to Paris regarding the multilateral response to climate change.  A new international climate change agreement between UN countries is to be developed and adopted at the Paris climate conference at the end of 2015 and implemented from 2020.</p><p>The Committee will monitor the way in which the Department proposes to prepare for the implementation of an agreement that sets targets beyond the timescales of current Northern Ireland action plans and programmes.

In 2014, an adaptation programme was also introduced for 2015-19, setting out actions that are needed to respond to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>The Committee's third priority relates to evaluations that were carried out under the REFIT programme.

It certainly should not create a hierarchy of equality.  If people want to run a business to provide services or facilities to the public, it must be for everyone; they simply cannot pick and choose who they wish to serve.  The days when notices said, \"No blacks, no Irish, no dogs\" are gone.  We cannot, therefore, accept the DUP's amendment, which would remove our rejection of the proposed conscience clause contained in the motion.  The amendment may be dressed in a plausible manner but, so far, the DUP's tactic on the consultation process has been anything but respectful, accusing the Alliance Party of being anti-Christian.</p><p>Much of my career has been spent in the pursuit of racial equality in Northern Ireland.  The single equality Bill will include the amendment of race equality legislation to cover colour and nationality alongside race and ethnic origin.  If Members cast their minds back to the Assembly debate in 2009, they will recall that all parties supported the reform of race relations legislation.  The Alliance Party, Sinn F&#233;in and the SDLP all called for a single equality Bill in their manifestos.  The UUP manifesto called for the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 to be amended as a matter of urgency.  However, we continue to wait.</p><p>The draft racial equality strategy has still not been produced, even though the consultation closed in October 2014.  Several questions for written answer that I have submitted remain unanswered.  I do not need to remind the House of the fear felt among ethnic minority communities over the summer.  OFMDFM's snail's pace has certainly not reassured them.  The ethnic minority development fund runs out on 31 March and there has been no indication as to when and how it will be administered, even though organisations were told in February that the same level of funding will be available for the next financial year.</p><p>Clearly, Northern Ireland has now fallen behind in its equality legislation.  It is sobering to reflect that all equality laws applying to Northern Ireland have been delivered either through primary legislation in Westminster or through OFMDFM using the Order in Council, acting under direct rule.  Northern Ireland has been named in examinations of the UK by UN committees for non-compliance with treaty standards.  Our equality law is, in some areas, less likely to meet, and is potentially in breach of, the standards set out in international human rights conventions.</p><p>I will now highlight some of the points that Members made in the debate.  Paul Givan said that there was a knee-jerk reaction to his proposal for the conscience clause, which had been grossly misrepresented.  He said that the amendment is an olive branch to appeal to Members for respectful discussion.</p><p>Bronwyn McGahan said that the bill of rights and the single equality Bill should protect everyone.  Alex Attwood asked whether the DUP would confirm that it would accept the principle and practice of the age discrimination legislation covering under-16s.  He said that the Equality Commission had not been punching above its weight in promoting equality law.</p><p>Danny Kinahan said that we are out of step with equality legislation, particularly on disability and women's rights, and that the single equality Act process had ground to a halt because of the dysfunctional nature of OFMDFM.  He said that the UUP would support the amendment to find a way forward.</p><p>Stephen Moutray said that the conscience Bill is not about dominance but is meant to better protect those with genuine religious beliefs and should not be rejected outright by the Alliance Party.</p><p>Caitr&#237;ona Ruane said that the DUP has now rolled back on equality, that the conscience Bill is about the DUP's continued attempt to discriminate against the LGBT community, and that Sinn F&#233;in will use a petition of concern to stop the Bill.</p><p>Edwin Poots said that the Alliance Party is losing its argument against the conscience Bill and that there is too much discrimination happening against Christians.  Colum Eastwood mentioned that the age discrimination Act now discriminates against people on the basis of their age.  He questioned whether the DUP, because it did not seek to put down an amendment to the motion concerning the age discrimination Act, now supports age discrimination legislation not starting at age 16.  Alex Maskey said that the age discrimination Act should start at birth and apply to all ages.</p><p>Jim Allister accused the Alliance Party of lots of things, including being illiberal and being so bigoted that it is not prepared to consider what the Bill might say.  In our little world, we object to a lot of the things that he said.  He was actually wrong when he said that we supported 50:50 PSNI recruitment.  We did not.  He said that we supported the Catholic teachers' certificate.  We did not, so he was wrong again.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Equality Legislation: Revised Wording"}, {"date": "2015-03-16", "body": "<p>No, I am sorry.

That is what the motion says.  It is not up to us to set a time limit; it is up to OFMDFM.</p><p>We welcome the debate.  It is not only unionists who have long had a problem with this issue.  In practice, the 1976 exemption enables Catholic schools to employ Catholics if they so choose.  It is reaffirmed in article 71 of the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.  The Alliance Party has long supported the removal of the exemption.  It has been broadly agreed that the exemption could be lifted, with the requirement instead being the possession of a certificate in religious education.  Theoretically, that is available to anyone.  Even that is difficult, however, given the segregated nature of teacher training, with only St Mary's in practice offering the certificate automatically.</p><p>We will support the motion, and we certainly advocate our amendment.  The difficulty with the motion is not its content, with which we agree fully, but the time that it would take.  It would involve changing law, not just policy.  That is why we have left it intact but added a rider that would provide a quicker route to addressing the issue partially and would not involve legislation.  The amendment would put in place an interim solution that addresses the problems pending the passage of legislation, so they are complementary.</p><p>Even a legislative ban through the amendment of equality legislation may not be completely watertight.  A school could still attempt to cite a genuine occupational requirement as justification for discrimination, which may or may not be accepted by the courts if it were challenged.  That is why the amendment is necessary to achieve the desired objective, not just as a means of speeding things up.</p><p>There are a range of issues and problems relating to the teacher-training system in Northern Ireland, which have been discussed in detail over the last few months.  There is little point in returning to them, other than to note that all four other Executive parties ganged up to stop the obviously necessary reforms from taking place.  This debate is specifically about equality issues.  It is for OFMDFM to initiate legislative change.  It will be interesting to see whether the two First Ministers can agree on this issue and take necessary action.  I do not know whether one of them was supposed to be here to reply to the debate, but nobody is here at the moment.</p><p>Under the cover provided by the exemption to Northern Irish equality law, there is the ongoing requirement for a teacher to possess a certificate in religious education to work in nursery and primary schools in the Catholic-maintained sector.  That is a requirement in place via CCMS, which has the power to modify or remove that restriction.  That has been discussed with it on many occasions.  We continue to welcome the step of giving a three-year window to teachers who have been made redundant and who wish to teach in the Catholic sector to acquire the certificate.  The issue is about how easy that is to achieve and whether it should be relevant at all.</p><p>Changing demographics and enrolments in the school system mean that almost 40% of job opportunities require the possession of the certificate.  That seriously curtails opportunities for graduating teachers without the certificate, who actually constitute a majority.  That would never be ideal, but we really need to hear from every party in the Assembly that it now agrees that that is intolerable in a competitive job market with fewer and fewer opportunities and openings.  The principle is that any professional teacher, regardless of background, should be treated as equally capable of teaching in any type of school, including Catholic-maintained schools.  That is an absolute requirement.  Any party taking itself seriously as a party of equality would and should recognise it.  Teaching opportunities are becoming ever more restricted.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Teacher Employment: Inequality"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>Yes.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Teacher Employment: Inequality"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>I do not disagree with that.  I thank the Member for his intervention.</p><p>As I said, teaching opportunities are becoming ever more restricted as schools close and pension arrangements encourage teachers to stay on as opposed to encouraging early retirement, as they once did.  Restricted opportunities make equality of opportunity even more important and mean that there is an urgent need for intervention and change in policy and the law.  If we are to maintain the certificate, there must, as a bare minimum, be absolute equality of access to it.</p><p>In general, the issue predominantly affects Stranmillis.  It does not apply to Queen's, and training for the certificate is delivered in conjunction with the Church at the University of Ulster.  The only option at Stranmillis is distance learning through the University of Glasgow, and many students leave Stranmillis with absolutely no knowledge of the certificate at all, even including the extra time and resources required for it.  Some may argue that Stranmillis graduates have no interest in the certificate, but the principle is absolute, and it should be agreed by all parties.  Every graduating teacher should have access to the full range of opportunities for which they are qualified.</p><p>Stranmillis has recognised the problem and is seeking an immediate practical solution that meets the requirements of that principle.  MLAs from various parties have also recognised the problem and the potential solution of the use of St Mary's to teach the certificate as a distinct module that is open also to Stranmillis students.  The lack of availability at Stranmillis affects everyone who trains there, regardless of background.  There are Catholic students at Stranmillis, and they can leave without the certificate just as anybody else does.</p><p>Our amendment does not take away from the motion but complements it.  Implementation of the amendment, which calls for collaboration in the teacher-training system, would be a powerful statement but would not and should not preclude moving on to the necessary legislative change to deliver on the original motion.  This step would also amount to a powerful example of collaboration in the Northern Ireland teacher-training system.</p><p>In closing, I want to make it clear that the existence of a requirement for a teacher to possess a certificate in religious education to work in the maintained sector at primary level is a tradition that has served the sector very well for many years.  Catholic education has a long and proud record of success in Northern Ireland.  It has a religious basis grounded in the Catholic faith, and it is absolutely valid that teachers should be equipped to contribute to that ethos at the early years and primary level.  The Alliance Party's preference is for a much broader based solution than a Catholic-based religious certificate.  Our objective is for a single certificate, recognising diversity and pluralism, and it should be shared by any party advocating equality.  This is not about refusing to accommodate a different ethos.  On the contrary, it is about accommodating it fairly and equally.  It is important that teachers are trained for working in a range of different settings.  This means fair access to preparation for the Catholic maintained sector, but, in an increasingly diverse society, it particularly means catering for that growing diversity, including those of non-Christian faiths or no religious background in our school system.</p><p>We have a long way to go.  The amendment puts us on the right road.  The motion makes sure that we are heading in the right direction, but no one with a true interest in equality has anything to fear from that destination.

He may well graduate, and, if he is one of the 18% or so lucky enough to get a job, he will now take on an average contribution rate of 9&#183;6%, and the employer will eventually pay 13&#183;2% or something like that.  The 9&#183;6% contribution rate is well above the rate for a Civil Service or public service contribution, and the 13%-odd is well below it.  As well as that, the eventual benefits for teachers are no better, and in some cases are worse, than those provided by other public service schemes.  The eventual increase up to age 68 will hit the teacher who is now coming into the profession for the first time.  At present, most teachers retire before the age of 60 because &#8212; I would not like to say that they are \"burnt out\" &#8212; you come to the end of your useful teaching life at some stage in your late 50s or early 60s.

Now, we are doing completely the reverse:  we are effectively forcing teachers to work on until the age of 68.  At the same time, we are going to have hundreds into thousands of young graduate teachers who cannot get a job.

Like others, I thank the Department for its very useful briefing last Friday.  It was useful indeed.</p><p>For anyone who believes that the child, whatever their circumstances, should be at the heart of the education provision, this is a good day.  We all have to look forward with some trepidation to what the regulations and the code of practice will say, but it is a step forward along the way, and it is to be welcomed.  I do not intend to go through the Bill line by line at this stage, as I think that that is for Committee Stage, but I want to touch on one or two things.</p><p>The first is clause 5 and the reduction in the statementing time frame from 26 weeks to 20 weeks.  That is very welcome.  Everybody who presented to us wanted that process to be quicker.  It is important that, following the change, we monitor the actual time taken to ensure that 20 weeks becomes the limit and not the standard.  The proposal to establish an appeal mechanism for children under the age of two on statementing is also welcome.  I think that that is in clause 7.  There are a number of proposals to ensure that the child's particular needs are taken into account.  Clause 1 requires the authority to listen to the child's views.  I imagine that that was in previous legislation in some form or other, but it if needs to be said, there it is.</p><p>Clause 3 requires the board of governors to have a requirement for a personal learning plan for each pupil with special educational needs and to keep it under review.  That is another very welcome change.  I declare an interest as a governor of Barbour Nursery School.  That clause also looks at the learning support coordinator and the teaching staff.  Mr Rogers dwelt on that at some length.  I always listen to Mr Rogers with interest on these matters, because he has the edge over us in experience, having taught in a school.  I think that it is only him and perhaps the Chairperson who have that experience, and I fancy that Mr Rogers has the edge through length of experience.  He can annunciate the teaching profession's concerns on this, so I listened with interest.  I will listen with even more interest when we come to the Committee Stage.  There is no doubt that the demands on our teachers seem to grow every year, and they are certainly not going to lessen as a result of this.  It is important that it is properly managed and that we try to, as Mr Rogers put it, walk in the shoes of our teachers, which he did in his previous existence.</p><p>I share the concern, which virtually everybody voiced, about what is coming down the line in secondary legislation, the regulations and the code of practice.  This is just the beginning.  Hopefully, we will have some more detail on those matters before the end of our Committee Stage.  I am not quite sure how we could possibly form a real view on all this unless we have that information.</p><p>I welcome clause 8, on mediation.  Clause 9 grants a child over compulsory school age rights that were previously exercised by the parent.  If the child is over the compulsory school age, that seems like a very reasonable thing to do; as is the case with clause 10, which makes the same change in relation to disability discrimination claims.  Those two clauses go hand in hand.  They are to be welcomed, but, again, we will see the devil in the detail.</p><p>I do not have much more to say about this Bill at this stage, but I make a point that I have often made in the past, on the odd occasion that we actually have some education legislation:  there is only one schedule, but it incorporates about 80 amendments, and, within those 80, there are subsections which probably double that figure.  I think that the Minister said that the Bill starts off with the 1986 Order, amends the 1996 Order and also gives some attention to the Special Educational Needs and Disability (Northern Ireland) Order 2005.  I just wonder whether, at some point, given that we do not now write our legislation with quill pens &#8212; it is a lot more digital than that &#8212; we might rewrite the Order, rather than continually overlap and overlay new amendments.  It would be so much easier for people to understand and follow.  I do not imagine that it will happen on this occasion, but I will keep plugging at it because I think that, some day, we will have to come to that conclusion.

I rise to support the motion.  It gives me an opportunity to outline my party's position regarding water rates.</p><p>Sinn F&#233;in is on record throughout the island of Ireland opposing the imposition of water charges for domestic households.  In its 2007 manifesto, Sinn F&#233;in promised to block the introduction of water charges, and that is exactly what we did.  Just prior to the setting up of the Assembly and the Executive in 2007, direct rule Ministers established NIW, with a view to privatisation and the bringing in of household charges.  Conor Murphy, the first Minister after 2007, blocked the introduction of water charges, and I acknowledge the current Minister for continuing that policy.  Conor Murphy once likened the situation he inherited from direct rule Ministers to trying to turn a tanker in a canal.  He ruled out privatisation and made it clear that these public services will operate within full public ownership, now and in the future.  Sinn F&#233;in did so on the basis that households here were already hard pressed due to the difficult economic circumstances and should not be forced to endure an additional financial burden or stealth tax.  As the first Member said, people are dealing with higher rates bills as we speak.</p><p>Since 2007, we have invested over &#163;1 billion in water and sewerage services on overhauling an unfit sewerage system that had been neglected over decades by successive British Governments.  In Britain, the Tories took utilities that were paid for by the public, invested sums of public money to upgrade them, and later sold them to their friends and charged the public for continuing to use them.  Is that what we should do here?  We say no.</p><p>Sinn F&#233;in recognises that there are significant challenges across the island of Ireland to achieving a truly sustainable water and sewerage service &#8212; one that is affordable, meets environmental obligations and delivers a reliable, high-quality service.  However, we have proven in government that that can be done without driving struggling households into further poverty.  We recognise that water is a precious resource that is universally recognised as a basic human right, and its delivery should be paid for through general progressive tax and efficiencies in the system.  Here in the North, we do not have general taxation powers.  Therefore, water is subsidised by the Executive through domestic rates.  All parties in the Assembly should be calling for the transfer of taxation powers, which would give us greater control over our taxes and how our taxes are spent, including on keeping water and sewerage services in public ownership.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Phr&#237;omh-LeasCheann Comhairle.

From the outset, I condemn the illegal activity of diesel laundering.  It is a scourge and a blight on local communities and the environment in which the toxic sludge is dumped.  I agree with much of what was said by the first Member who spoke.  Our representatives have been standing up to the organised crime that is termed fuel laundering.  The people operating the fuel plants are criminals. They have no respect for the environment, as they discard their poisonous waste throughout the countryside.  The victims of their actions are their own communities and relatives &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>Yes.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>They have not got anywhere, and I will address your issue later in my speech.</p><p>The cost of the recovery and disposal of toxic sludge is high.  My colleague Megan Fearon recently called for increased funding for the NIEA so that it can continue to clear diesel waste.  The Environment Agency has claimed that it has run out of money to clear the waste.  Money needs to be found if we are to safeguard the environment.</p><p>The republican movement was mentioned in some earlier comments, but the reality is that some of the most senior republicans and Sinn F&#233;in elected representatives, including Conor Murphy and Mickey Brady, have been standing up to organised crime regardless of its form.  Every effort should be made to ensure that support is given to policing authorities on both sides of the border to stamp out fuel laundering, given the damage that it does to communities.  As someone who comes from a border community, I can say for certain that there is no support for this activity.  It is imperative that there is a close working relationship between the PSNI and an Garda S&#237;och&#225;na in investigating fuel laundering.  The fact that there have been no, or very few, prosecutions is disappointing.  If that continues, confidence in policing will be more difficult to achieve in those areas.</p><p>Immediate investment in policing and customs is one solution to the problem.  That would be financially beneficial to the economies of the North and the South. Another way is to introduce a new dye.  In 2013, the South of Ireland introduced a system whereby green diesel is tracked from supplier to customer.  In just over 12 months, the sale of green diesel fell by approximately 10% and the sale of road diesel increased, which brought in &#8364;150 million more to public funds.  That system needs to be replicated here to increase public funds and reduce laundering and dumping.</p><p>Fuel laundering is not a victimless crime.  It damages the environment, impacts on revenue and wrecks people's cars.  I cannot state more strongly and loudly that what is happening is criminality.  Those involved are not republicans.  We all must be resolute in our condemnation of this activity.  All efforts should be employed to eradicate fuel laundering.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I oppose the motion.  Like other Members said, our thoughts should be with the Carroll family, some of whom I know personally.</p><p>There are two aspects to this motion:  miscarriages of justice and Mr Worton's case for compensation for the period he spent in prison.  Whilst we have sympathy with Mr Worton as he was acquitted of the charges on the basis that the only evidence against him was a statement he made in Castlereagh holding centre, might I add that, in that respect, Mr Worton's case is similar to hundreds of other cases.  I do not accept Mr Poots's statement that this should not be opened up to all cases.  I believe that it should.</p><p>I question the methods of obtaining statements from Mr Worton.  The methods that the police employed in Castlereagh and other holding centres were highly questionable during this period.  Human rights organisations often criticised the police for obtaining statements under duress.  I know many people who experienced degrading and threatening behaviour whilst in custody.  Rather than focusing on one case, it would be better if the sponsors of the motion had called for legislation to deal with all cases of this nature.</p><p>The motion states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This Assembly notes the miscarriage of justice in the case of the UDR four\".</p><p>It must be remembered that one person was convicted of Adrian Carroll's murder.  Miscarriages of justice arise from the criminal justice system of that time &#8212; a system that my community had little confidence in.  Human rights organisations accused courts of turning a blind eye to dubious police interrogation practices, which routinely led to a conviction, in the shape of a confession, not to mention the dark periods of the paid perjurer era.</p><p>More recently, the blight of the miscarriages of justice has raised serious concerns about the judicial system, with the quashing of many convictions from that period.  An article in a modern law review recently explored the neglected area of miscarriages of justice and suggested that they may be much more extensive than previously realised and that the level of appeals for wrongful convictions is low.  However, it said that that is not a reliable indicator of justice served.  The article quotes a figure of over 300 such cases that could be reviewed.</p><p>To conclude, a Cheann Comhairle, as my colleague Raymond McCartney said, if the motion had been framed in another form that sought the review of all miscarriages of justice as a result of the criminal justice system, which included dubious interrogation methods and the role of the Diplock courts, we would have supported it.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: UDR Four"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Phr&#237;omh-LeasCheann Comhairle.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to make a winding-up speech on what was an important debate.  As Deputy Chair, I want to put on record my thanks to the many contributors who made this report a success and made it possible.  I thank the members of the Committee; the all-party group on cycling, a number of whom spoke in the debate; and all the witnesses and officials from the Department for Regional Development.  I thank the Departments of Health; Culture, Arts and Leisure; and Environment.  In particular, I thank those who we met when we visited County Mayo.  I thank our support team, Hansard, and our Assembly researcher for all the excellent support.  I thank the Minister for coming here today, and the Members for their contributions.</p><p>As I said, this was an important debate.  The range of contributions show how important cycling is to the economy.  If I may, a Phr&#237;omh-LeasCheann Comhairle, I will refer briefly to some of the points made.</p><p>My colleague Declan McAleer noted that the strategy had not been rural proofed, which is a valid point and one that the Committee laboured over during the inquiry.  I welcome the Minister's commitment in his speech to rural proof the strategy.  Declan referred to the need for equal treatment between rural and urban areas.  That supports the Committee's position that the cycling strategy and cycling initiatives are urban-focused.</p><p>Declan and others referred to INTERREG funding.  The Committee supported the Department in calling for a larger budget for cycling within the INTERREG programme, and saw at first-hand the desire for cross-border cycling projects.  He highlighted the potential for opening greenways across the island of Ireland, citing the Great Western Greenway project at Mulranny.  I think we would all agree that that is an example for success across the island.</p><p>John Dallat, in welcoming the report, highlighted the relevant fact that the North lags behind the rest of Europe.  Whilst I am sure that he was referring to a particular rail line, I think we received clarity that he would be supportive of disused rail lines being developed as greenways.  Again, the Committee is supportive of that concept, but it did not want to see any further pilot projects as there were sufficiently successful greenways operating.</p><p>Sandra Overend, as a member of the all-party group that came before us, welcomed the report as positive, although critical of the Department's strategy.  Other contributions today supported that criticism.  She suggested that recommendations 27 and 40 of the report were contradictory.  The Committee does not necessarily agree with that, and cites examples of innovative projects in recommendation 40.  I find it somewhat rich that the Committee is criticised for not identifying alternative funding streams when the Minister and his officials have not identified any sources of funding in their strategy.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Cycling: Benefits to the Economy"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat.  I thank the Member, and I take her point.</p><p>Chris Lyttle is another member of the all-party group who came in front of us and made a valuable contribution.  He referred to the three barriers to cycling, including ownership.</p><p>The Committee, as the Chair indicated during the interjections, has called for an extension to the bike-to-work scheme, including making it a compulsory programme in the public sector.  He also, quite rightly, highlighted the absence of integrated transport solutions.  We have called for Translink to identify better means of integrating cycling with public transport.</p><p>Alex Easton and Stephen Moutray highlighted the health benefits of cycling.  We have called for roads to be health proofed, similar to the assessments being carried out on the Connswater greenway, through the World Health Organization's health economic assessment tool.</p><p>Joe Byrne spoke about the cycling phenomenon, particularly in his home town of Omagh, and the positive impact it had on the local economy.  He highlighted the need to establish appropriate baselines.</p><p>Sammy Douglas said he took up cycling three years ago for health reasons and that his only regret was that it was too late.  Sammy, I do not think it is ever too late.  Like you, I took up cycling and I totally agree with you that the health benefits are significant.  He rightly encouraged more people to cycle and heralded the benefits, personally and for the wider population, including family outings.  Sandra Overend mentioned family cycling as well.  Sammy welcomed the cycling revolution, and both he and the Chair commended the Department on its cycling conference.</p><p>Steven Agnew welcomed the focus that the Committee has brought to cycling.  He spoke about cycling creating a modal shift and said that it should be one of our choices of transport.  He also spoke about the hurdles and barriers to using public transport and cycling.</p><p>The Minister welcomed the report, said that the inquiry was timely and opportune and commended the work of the Committee.  He welcomed the fact that he is sympathetic to many of our recommendations.  He also indicated his continued support for the Active School Travel programme, which is welcome.  We look forward to working on the primary legislation on physical activity in due course.  We agree that the strategy needs to drive forward, and we look forward to helping it do that.  We again welcome his comments on the cycle-to-work scheme.</p><p>The Minister stated that the strategy was not a war on motorists, and they will be glad to hear that.  Those were not criticisms for the sake of it, they were perceptions expressed by one or more members during the inquiry.

If the contribution of Trevor Clarke is anything to go by, we are going to have scaremongering and misrepresentation of the Alliance Party, as is par for the course, with little to no new ideas about how we address the serious issue of underinvestment in our water system, which is interesting, given that Trevor Clarke was quoted on 4 October 2014 as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Water charges in Northern Ireland have been deferred until 2016 but everything is potentially up for discussion\".</p><p>So, it has been an interesting contribution from him so far today.  I will take this opportunity to respond to the motion on behalf of the Alliance Party and I will challenge the deliberate misrepresentation of our position by political parties intent on electioneering.</p><p>The Alliance Party will support the motion as we oppose the introduction of additional water charges at this time, in line with the Executive agreement and because other Executive parties have failed to tackle waste and inefficiency in their Departments.  We do, however, need to give serious consideration as to how water and sewerage infrastructure will be adequately financed and governed if fit-for-purpose provision for existing and new customers, environmental protection, flood prevention and economic growth are to be achieved.</p><p>Alliance believes that existing charges for water should be more open and transparent.  Households should have an identifiable charge for water separated from the rates bill, with no household paying twice.  That would provide a clearer picture of how our water and sewerage system is being paid for, with protections for vulnerable households, and Northern Ireland Water would have, in part, an improved borrowing ability for capital investment in this vital service.  So, we support the motion but we challenge the proposers to consider how water and sewerage will be financed and governed on a long-term basis, and to acknowledge the cost to the taxpayer of waste and inefficiency in other Executive Departments.</p><p>The cost of division is estimated at over &#163;1 billion every year.  That is around &#163;1,000 per household per year.</p><p>Separate education costs around &#163;300 million. There is separate teacher training: proposals on that were put forward by an Alliance Minister and blocked by other parties in the Executive.  Welfare reform fines and the policing of parades and protests cost the taxpayer in Northern Ireland multimillions of pounds every year.  That is wasted money that could otherwise be used to fund health, education and jobs and protect vulnerable people in our community.  The refusal of other parties to tackle the cost of that waste and division has a devastating impact on the very households that the DUP claims to support. Unlike other political parties, Alliance Ministers are working to reduce the cost of waste and division for households and to maximise the resources that we have to build a shared society and a strong economy for everyone in our community.</p><p>Alliance certainly does not want households to pay more in water charges to simply paper over the cracks of financial mismanagement by the DUP and Sinn F&#233;in with the willing support of other political parties. Political parties need to get serious about tackling waste and have a realistic debate about how we fund much-needed improvements to our water system. People in my constituency of East Belfast know painfully well that the current level of investment in water and sewerage infrastructure is not enough.  The current model does little to help those households every time we have heavy rain and the panic of more flood damage to homes sets in.  It is my understanding that the Belfast drainage plan alone requires an investment of around &#163;750 million.  Funding for NI Water, however, includes a subsidy of approximately &#163;275 million every year, paid for by the taxpayer from the Executive Budget, and that is &#163;275 million that cannot be spent on other vital services and contributes to a funding model that limits the ability of NI Water to borrow for capital investment.  I would be interested to hear from other parties how they think the Belfast drainage plan will be funded.  The Executive should consider alternative models for funding capital investment in our water system.  One alternative would be to mutualise, as has happened in Wales, to improve borrowing ability for capital investment.</p><p>Alliance opposes the introduction of additional water charging at this time, but we oppose the squandering by other political parties of Executive Department budgets that are vital to protect the households in Northern Ireland that the proposer of the motion claims to support.

I thank the Chair of the OFMDFM Committee, Mike Nesbitt, for setting out our Committee priorities for scrutinising policy on labour mobility, migration, the European Convention on Human Rights and subsidiarity, and for highlighting the fact that our Committee will continue to scrutinise the drawdown of EU funding by the Executive and its delivery of our Barroso task force inquiry recommendations.</p><p>I thank Brenda Hale for her comments and her advocacy that we need greater Northern Ireland Executive cooperation if we are to benefit fully from European Union funding and policy in some of the key areas that we have set as Programme for Government targets, in particular Delivering Social Change in our community, assisting our children and young people, tackling poverty and ensuring that our fishermen and farmers get the best deal possible.</p><p>I also thank Bronwyn McGahan, who stressed the importance of EU membership to Northern Ireland and encouraged the Executive to increase our engagement in EU matters to ensure that a Northern Irish voice is heard clearly in Europe.  She also mentioned the need for EU funding to be accessed and how vital it is for jobs and growth, in particular for CAP, the European social fund, peace-building investment in Northern Ireland and INTERREG for our businesses.  She also mentioned the European Commission emphasis on delivering sustainable development and tackling climate change and how important it is for our Executive to contribute to those goals.</p><p>Patsy McGlone MLA spoke in a private capacity and as Chair of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, challenging Eurosceptics to remember the importance that the European Union plays in promoting and celebrating diversity among and across our countries and stressing the significant net benefit of European membership to Northern Ireland, which was &#163;2&#183;4 billion between 2007 and 2013.  He also stressed the priorities of the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee for the year ahead to look at the European Investment Fund, banks, SMEs and energy supply security and, indeed, emphasised the work to be done on the integration of a single energy market, carbon reduction and the importance of research and development to improving our energy supply in Northern Ireland.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: European Scrutiny Priorities 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>What message do the Executive have for our world-class artists &#8212; poets such as Michael Longley, writers such as Glenn Patterson and young actors such as Jayne Wisener &#8212; who say that the scale and level of reductions applied to the arts in Northern Ireland are wrong?

When I look at this motion, I know instinctively that it is fiscally reckless Ulster nationalism.

It is not a good place for our country to be in that it is only about money.</p><p>In opening the debate, Mr Clarke rightly said that someone should pay for the water.  Absolutely, but in his view that someone should be in the south of England, not in Northern Ireland.  He does not want us to pay for anything.

The Finance Minister constantly repeats the idea that we are the region in the UK with the lowest household charges, yet we get &#163;2,000 more to spend per head of population from the rest of the UK &#8212; and still it is not enough. Although I have no ideological difficulty with a charge for water or with paying for it through my rates, my big difficulty is that I would not give this politically exhausted Executive one penny piece more, because they will not reform anything.  They are exhausted and have no purpose, no direction and no idea where they are going or what they want to do in any policy area.</p><p>You can take any example, whether it is topping up welfare with &#163;565 million while slashing early years funding or slashing funding to the environment from the Mourne Heritage Trust to the Causeway Coast.  Where is the joined-up thinking in government?  We have an Executive who are giving that away and want to cut corporation tax, at a cost of over &#163;300 million, while still slashing the skills budget.  Where is the consistency in Executive policies?  We have a Health Minister who has claimed that there is not enough money to deliver, having said in a previous mandate that health was nearly overfunded and too well looked after.  Yet, Transforming Your Care has stalled.  Three and a half years after Transforming Your Care was announced, it has stalled.  It is going nowhere and is delivering nothing.  There is no money to make it happen.

I thought that you were introducing me as the Minister.  I will not detain the Minister for too long; I just have a couple of points to make.</p><p>The Minister is usually keen to stress how difficult a financial period we face, and there is a huge financial gain for the public service in putting in place a better process and making sure that we are doing all we can.  As colleagues have mentioned, it will take a partnership approach to drill down, look at best practice and see what needs to change.  Also, as Mrs Cochrane mentioned, we have to look at early interventions where possible, whether it is physiotherapy or access to the types of services that return people to full health more quickly and get them back to work, or partially back to work.  All those factors need to be taken into account.</p><p>One huge issue is the number of females in the public sector, who often must balance work with family life and caring responsibilities, whether for children or an older family member or parent.  That can all have a huge impact on how we manage, and we need more flexibility at times in the workplace, as I know from my family experience.  We have just finished six weeks of chickenpox with three children and having to find a place for them, since they could not go to their childminder during that period.  You either rely on grandparents to help out or else one of the parents has to take a day off.  That flexibility needs to be built in because it can be very difficult for any of us to manage, and those in the public sector are no different.</p><p>All these factors are very relevant, but we must continue to drive the figure down, reminding ourselves that, if we were at the same level as the rest of the country, &#163;30 million to &#163;37 million &#8212; a huge sum of money &#8212; could be reinvested and redirected into other services, so there is a huge gain to be got.  We also have to remember and look at the issues of stress and mental health.  Quite rightly, mental health is the biggest disability we have, and we have to look at the workplace practices that lead to stress and mental health issues, because, as a general rule, work is good for people's mental and physical health.  It is a positive thing, and those are some of the factors that we need to look at, Mr Speaker.

I am surprised at others supporting it.  When I first read the motion, I was reminded of Neil Kinnock's remarks when he turned to address militants in his own party.  This is what he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I&#8217;ll tell you what happens with impossible promises.  You start with far-fetched resolutions.  They are then pickled into a rigid dogma, a code, and you go through the years sticking to that, out-dated, mis-placed, irrelevant to the real needs, and you end up in ... grotesque chaos\".</p><p>That is where Sinn F&#233;in is now stuck.  On the one hand, it talks about criticising big business, but then it is cutting corporation tax.  It talks about the block grant, the cost and price of the Union and austerity and of how evil the Tories and Tory cuts are.  Did it watch the leader of the Labour Party, who is hoping to be prime minister of our country in a few weeks, trying to sell himself as a man who will be fiscally responsible?  There were no promises of reckless spending but of trying to buy in to a triple-lock.</p><p>As part of the coalition agreement, the Tories in 2010 &#8212; the Minister may wish to allude to this &#8212; ring-fenced and protected health spending.  We get a Barnett consequential for that.  That made a big difference to what happened.  The Minister will probably know the Barnett consequential better than I, but if the Tory and Lib Dem Government happen to be re-elected by promising year-on-year increases in health spending by up to &#163;8 billion until 2020, the consequential will be somewhere in the region of &#163;230 million to &#163;240 million.  The very fact that a future UK government could protect health and education, amounting to 60%-plus of our Budget, is the kind of thing that has shielded this Executive from the real ravages of austerity.</p><p>I remember a previous debate on the Budget when Mr Nesbitt gave some figures about UK debt.  I reminded the House that the Republic of Ireland had reduced its spending by some &#8364;30 billion, the equivalent of 18% of GDP.  If the UK had to reduce public spending at the same level, that would have equated to &#163;500 billion.  I will let the Minister work out how much that would have been off our block grant.</p><p>There seems to be an idea that you can keep asking for more and more, and that more money is always the answer.  When you are part of a union, you have to take some of the hits.  The Executive boast that we have the lowest household charges anywhere in the UK.  As Mr Cree pointed out, we have the highest levels of public spending in the UK.  Those situations cannot be balanced with endless talk of more and more money.</p><p>There are no ideas coming from the Government.  Corporation tax is, effectively, the only thing in the tank.  They want to cut corporation tax and, as Mr Allister said, the hope is that all this investment will come in.  That might be good, positive and could help us to grow, but not when we are cutting our skills budget.</p><p>We signed up for welfare reform.  Other colleagues have talked about civic society buying into that.  We had the Make it Work campaign come up to the Stormont House Agreement talks.  When people saw what Make it Work really looked like, they all ran for cover.  Suddenly, it was a case of, \"Hang on, maybe we don't want to make it work as well as that.\"  That included parties that are in the Government.  We have Sinn F&#233;in, which signed up to welfare reform.  We debated it, were making progress with it, and things were going very nicely until they got a bit nervous because they had not read the small print or something properly, and there was a row &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I am happy to take an intervention at this stage.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I agree with that but, as Mr McKinney was shouting, it is your Budget.

One of the most important things to remember about this debate, and one of the reasons why I am disappointed that there is no ministerial response, is that, for me, it is about shared education.  It is much wider than just the aspects of what Mr Kinahan has in his motion, and there ought to be a ministerial response from the Department on it.  That is why I brought amendments forward to the Education Bill around a duty to promote shared education and why I have said repeatedly that it cannot simply be about bussing children between different schools.  It must be about making sectors within our education system more open, more pluralist and more reflective of society.</p><p>Ensuring that more children from different backgrounds are able to learn together every day is vital for the future of our society and economy.  I firmly believe that that can be done whilst maintaining those different sectors' rights to teach according to a certain ethos.  That is why I have been so disappointed in the Minister's draft shared education Bill.  In my view, it is almost taking minimalist to a new level in its lack of ambition.</p><p>I believe that the real debate about shared education must be on the issues such as those we are debating today, because I fully support the motion and, indeed, the amendment from the Alliance Party.  Removing the exemption in fair employment law would, in my view, be a progressive move.  There is a challenge to those who claim to want a shared future and genuine equality.  They need to articulate in detail why they oppose such a change.</p><p>I will take several of the points, Mr Deputy Speaker.  Sinn F&#233;in claims to want an Ireland of equals; it claims to be the party of equality.  Why then would it be opposed to changing this?  I take Mr Ramsey's point on the value of faith/ethos education entirely.  I get that, and I buy into it.  I look at schools and results from other parts of the UK; I look at parts of England and Wales where they have shared schools and where they have faith/ethos schools that are outperforming other schools.  That is something that we want, but that does not require an individual certificate.  As Members opposite and, indeed, Mr Kinahan pointed out, a special certificate is not required if you are teaching science, maths or English.  That is where the difference is.</p><p>Take, for example, Liverpool.  There are shared schools there between the Church of England and Roman Catholic faiths.  There are also Anglican schools, where the majority of pupils are actually from a Muslim background.</p><p>There are other Catholic schools in which a large percentage of the pupils are from a non-Catholic background, or, indeed, from no religious background.  Parents are opting for those schools because their ethos is right.  We should surely be able to get that right.  We have an opportunity to amend the Minister's Bill and to make decisions.  We need to go much further than the changes that the Minister has been suggesting.</p><p>What are some of the changes that I would like to see made?  I would like an education system that incentivises ethos schools to look at other issues and to increase their intake of children from different backgrounds.  I also want to change regulations for governing bodies so that schools and board of governors have a more diverse background.  I want us to make it easier for schools to change ethos or sector if there is a genuine demand from local people.  There is an opportunity in the forthcoming Bill to do that.  It is a much better opportunity than trailing our feet and hoping that a single equality Bill will somehow deliver the answer.  We can protect and defend a faith/ethos education and make it more diverse &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Teacher Employment: Inequality"}], "title": "", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2011-05-09 13:07:07", "person_id": "13905", "entered_reason": "election", "full_name": "John McCallister", "member_id": "90430", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "UUP", "constituency": "South Down"}, {"left_reason": "dissolution", "first_name": "John", "last_name": "McCallister", "left_house": "2011-03-24", "title": "", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2011-03-28 17:40:16", "person_id": "13905", "entered_reason": "election", "full_name": "John McCallister", "member_id": "90299", "entered_house": "2007-03-09", "party": "UUP", "constituency": "South Down"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Fra", "last_name": "McCann", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.

We see them as an element of learning that had in the past not matched what were seen as the more prestigious roads to travel when seeking higher levels of education &#8212; subjects such as law, teaching and medicine.</p><p>We have argued that the earlier that you get people interested in what are called STEM subjects, the more likely it is that children will buy into these subjects.  We have heard it said in Committee that eager young minds are enthusiastic when it comes to learning different subjects.  We heard from a scientist who gave evidence to the Committee on the question of careers.  He said that, when he went into primary schools to speak to children about the importance of science, they played an active role in his presentations but that, when he left, the traditional thought process of many teaching staff re-geared young minds to a different road to travel when it came to academic importance to one's future career.</p><p>I have heard the Minister speak about the need to teach STEM subjects, but he has also said that STEM should feature prominently as part of the curriculum for all students.  There is no doubt in my mind that he is totally committed to the need not only to promote STEM subjects but to equip students to meet the needs of a changing world of employment.</p><p>All reports on the provision of STEM see it as crucial for our future needs.  I read recently that some of the new jobs that the Executive have fought hard to bring to the North could be impacted on by the lack of experience in STEM subjects.

I have read the answers to a number of questions that have been asked of the Minister in the House on the matter.  I have browsed a number of reports on STEM, and I welcome the Minister's commitment to tackling the issue of gender imbalance in the STEM sectors.  He gave a speech to a conference on 10 March organised by Semta NI to celebrate the success of women in STEM in addressing gender imbalance.</p><p>The motion is trying to ensure that there is a joined-up approach taken to tackling the serious imbalance of men over women in the STEM sectors, and it argues for the Minister, in conjunction with his Executive colleagues, to produce an action plan that specifically addresses the issue of gender imbalance.</p><p>I will now deal with some of the comments made by Members.  The Minister dealt extensively with quite a lot of them and even encouraged Members to speak to their party colleagues at the Executive table to do something about the issue.  Bronwyn McGahan spoke at length about the need to tackle the conditions that impact on women taking STEM subjects.  She said that the will exists to move on the matter but that it will take the Executive as a whole to be a part of the process if the situation is to move on.  She commended the South West College for the work that it has carried out on STEM.</p><p>Tom Buchanan said that it was inconceivable that, in this day and age, that imbalance exists in the make-up of the workforce and that it needs to be tackled.  He spoke about good practice in the USA that we can learn from and maybe look at setting up similar bodies here.</p><p>Se&#225;n Rogers said that the Assembly discussed STEM some weeks ago, concerned at the worrying lack of take-up of STEM subjects.  The North is experiencing a brain drain; demand for STEM jobs cannot be met.  There is a need to bring more women through the STEM process.</p><p>Sandra Overend said that responsibility lay not only with the Employment and Learning Minister but with the Education Minister.  The motion could deliver the much-needed strategy.  The Women in STEM project is working to promote more women in STEM.  She asked where the childcare strategy to encourage women into the workforce was and spoke of the need to work together to achieve a proper gender balance.</p><p>Anna Lo said that the workforce of the future needed to be STEM-educated.  Women and girls would have a much better chance at employment if they were involved in STEM careers.  There needs to be a focus on women scientists as role models, and that could be one way of encouraging women to take up STEM subjects. By working together we can achieve the objective of dealing with the imbalance.</p><p>David Hilditch congratulated schools in his constituency that have excelled in STEM subjects.  The imbalance of women in STEM could be dealt with effectively only when the barriers that prevent women from participating are dealt with.  He asked whether society would ever get to grips with many of those imbalances.  He spoke of the role of China in education in STEM subjects.</p><p>Chris Hazzard said that he hoped that the media would pick up on the debate.  The stereotype of scientists needs to be tackled.  We need to constantly assess the problem of imbalance.  He congratulated the Employment and Learning Minister on his work on careers, especially on continued professional advice for educators, especially at primary level, building a model of scholarship that will encourage young women to participate.</p><p>Sydney Anderson said that every effort should be made to ensure that every child at primary and secondary school and university should advance in STEM. He spoke about the need to go into STEM subjects.  Males go into STEM subjects while females go to different subjects.  There are new elements of growth.  The future will be built on STEM-trained personnel for new jobs.  Events that promote STEM can be invaluable and need to be encouraged.  He sees a key role for a number of Departments in the matter.</p><p>Patsy McGlone spoke of how women were significantly underrepresented in STEM programmes.  There is no quick fix.  There is a need to strengthen the connection between government, business, education and, of course, childcare.  Childcare came through on a number of issues raised by Members.  Other Ministers have a role.  Young girls need to be convinced that it is not just a male programme.  Females shine through with higher grades.  Individuals involved in STEM are sought after.  STEM subjects open many possibilities.  There is a need to work together with a strategic approach.</p><p>Stephen Farry, the Minister, spoke at length, again, about the need to reinforce the work that he has done with his Department and the need to get better balance.  STEM subjects are relevant.  Female participation is important.  It is the fastest-growing part of the economy.  There is a need to maximise the workforce.  We cannot go forward when 50% of the workforce is not given or does not take up the opportunity.  His Department has led on the strategy.  He spoke about addressing gender imbalance.  A report contains a number of recommendations to deal with imbalance.  Major companies have signed up to STEM programmes.  He has initiated strategies that will help to deal with the gender imbalance.  The Careers Service plays an important role in STEM advice, especially for females, but it could be impacted on by budget cuts.  Both universities are working to protect STEM, and &#163;71,000 has been provided to help promote STEM among women.  The Minister also spoke of the number of programmes that his Department is involved in that will help to promote STEM, especially among women.</p><p class=\"italic\">Question put and agreed to.\n\nResolved:</p><p class=\"italic\">That this Assembly expresses concern that men outnumber women by nearly three to one in high-level science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) posts; welcomes the statement by the Minister for Employment and Learning on 4 June 2013 reiterating the importance of women in the STEM sectors; and calls on the Minister for Employment and Learning, in conjunction with his Executive colleagues, to publish a strategy and action plan that addresses specifically the issue of gender imbalance in the STEM sectors.</p><p class=\"italic\">Motion made:\n\nThat the Assembly do now adjourn. &#8212; [Mr Principal Deputy Speaker.]</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics"}, {"date": "2015-03-10", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Phr&#237;omh-LeasCheann Comhairle.

I am sure you will be glad to hear that I do not intend to speak for long, as I believe that all that needs to be said was said when the five party leaders signed an agreement on 19 December, which, I believe, protects the most vulnerable in our society from benefit loss.  That was a far different agreement from the one agreed two days before.  It was an agreement &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Welfare Reform Bill: Further Consideration Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-24", "body": "<p>I am just coming to the amendments.  Sorry.</p><p>It was an agreement that excluded much of what was achieved on 19 December.  You have to ask yourself what is it that the SDLP wants to achieve through its amendments?  Is it to make things better for people?  The answer must be no, given that it signed up for much less on 17 December, which is something that it still refuses to admit to people.</p><p>Let us take the amendments and clauses on sanctions.  Had it been from any other party, I might have said, \"Well, they are sincere on this matter\", but the Attwood sanctions brought in during the last mandate, have, from 2011, seen over 80,000 people being reported for sanctions and 28,000 people actually sanctioned.  Why did they not ask for people who fell foul of those sanctions to receive documentation?  I would prefer it if sanctions were not being implemented.  In fact, this party is on record as having that position when we argued against the Attwood sanctions, but we were part of a five-party agreement, which we have stood by.  Did we get everything we wanted?  No, we did not.  Would I have liked to have got more in the agreement?  Yes, I would.</p><p>What we got was an agreement that mitigates the worst excesses of welfare reform.  We argued against the three-year sanction and were able to get it reduced to 18 months.  What makes this debate difficult is that the SDLP agreed to a two-year sanction and then thought that it could pull the wool over people's eyes by supporting the six-month proposal from Steven Agnew.</p><p>Let us look at the proposed amendments.  Amendment No 2, which is to clause 26, page 13, line 14, is on the provision of explanatory documentation and sanctions.  Amendment No 3 is to clause 27, page 13, line 36, and it is my understanding that claimants will be made aware in writing of when sanctions will be applied.  Through amendment No 3, the SDLP has again sought to amend clause 26, again seeking documentation.  It is my understanding that, if someone is sanctioned, they will be given notification of the sanction.  The same goes for amendment No 8, which is to clause 47, page 25, line 40; amendment No 9, which is to clause 47, page 26, line 29; and amendment No 10, which is to clause 47, page 28, line 12.  Notification will be supplied to people of the sanctions that they face.</p><p>Amendment No 4 is to clause 30, which is under the heading \"Delegation and contracting out\".  Sinn F&#233;in has always been opposed to the privitisation of public services.  I am again surprised that the SDLP raised that matter, given its record in the last mandate of privatising medical services, which saw Atos arrive on the scene and saw the hated work capability assessment being put in place.  That has led to tens of thousands of people losing their incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance.  We have also seen the SDLP implement the local housing allowance, which, on its watch, led to thousands of the most vulnerable losing out on housing benefit in the first stages of welfare reform.</p><p>My colleague Mickey Brady touched on Steven Agnew's amendments.  I think that he echoed what I would have said, so I will not bore people by repeating his words, but I will stress again that Mr Agnew has had many opportunities to raise those issues and has not.  It is his right to try to amend what he likes, but it is our right to highlight his inconsistencies as we see them.</p><p>I support the amendments in the name of the Minister and oppose the other amendments.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Welfare Reform Bill: Further Consideration Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>Will the Member give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant: Reductions"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>It existed before partition and after partition.

As Robin Swann said, it is no surprise that, for a long time, we have argued against the introduction of sanctions, especially in their most severe form of three years.  We have been on record over many years in the House as saying that there needed to be a different approach taken.  One of the reasons that we continually argued for that was to do with people who may be bipolar, people who suffer from other mental illnesses, the partially sighted and people with other disabilities, who sometimes may not understand the pages and pages that people get issued.  When they go through them, all that there is on them is a date on which you have to turn up.

I will take it in a minute.  I want to deal with some stuff.  I remember when sanctions were first introduced in the House.  We put up arguments in all the debates and tabled amendments.

Of those, almost 27,000 people were sanctioned, probably with the loss of benefit.  That is why we have been so severe in our arguments and in debates around the implementation of any type of sanction.</p><p>We went into discussions pre-Christmas.  Did we get all that we wanted?  No, we did not.  What we did get was a compromise to allow the Bill to go through and the institutions to stay up.  What really concerns me is listening again to two Members &#8212; Dolores Kelly and Robin Swann &#8212; talk about what they would accept.  They forget that, on 17 December, in the four-party discussions, they had accepted two years as the maximum, yet Dolores Kelly is saying today that she wants it to be reduced to 26 weeks.  Maybe she can explain that.  I do not want to labour the point.  The facts are there, and they speak for themselves.  Sinn F&#233;in went into this trying, as much as we can, to argue the principles that we stand for.  Others came in with theirs, and there was a compromise.  A partnership was forged, but people sought to walk away from that partnership.

Like Mr Attwood before me, I am speaking on behalf of a colleague who sits on the Social Development Committee.  Also like Mr Attwood, who declared an interest &#8212; it was an almost-interest, I think, if I am correct from what he said &#8212; in what we are discussing, I declare an interest, and I am delighted to be where I am.  I do not think that what we are discussing will have any effect on me, although having listened to Mr Attwood and his dire forecasts about the Tories coming in, I am a bit nervous that what we have will be shattered and interfered with by an incoming, relentless Tory Government.  Anyway, I will continue.</p><p>The Bill will provide the means to implement reforms to our state pension system to ensure that it is on a par with that in the rest of the UK.  The key changes are the creation of a single-tier pension system, changes to the pensionable age, bereavement support and alterations to the law on private pensions.  Part 1 of the Bill introduces a single-tier pension that is to start from April next year, increasing the number of qualifying years to 10 and the number of qualifying years for a full pension to 35.  That presented a number of concerns to interested groups during the Committee Stage.  The Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland in particular expressed concern that women may be more adversely affected than men.  Following discussions with DSD, the Committee was content that impacts would ultimately be ironed out.  Let us hope that that is the case.</p><p>Another issue that I am keen to ensure is effectively monitored is the increase in the years of National Insurance contributions required to qualify for a state pension.  The Committee was concerned that, in a changing labour market, with many people being underemployed, many would not meet the earnings threshold for National Insurance contributions.  They would ultimately not qualify for a pension after 35 years because, even if they have worked, they would not have earned enough to make National Insurance contributions.  However, I have hope that, with HMRC and DWP discussions, there can be a solution that means that years of work can be counted towards pension entitlement.</p><p>Part 2 of the Bill will also raise the pensionable age to 67.  As a society, we need to recognise that we are living longer and that, therefore, the pensionable age should be adjusted to reflect that.  Nonetheless, it is vital that the Department effectively communicates those changes to allow for effective financial management for those approaching pensionable age.  Furthermore, I am also reassured by the assertion that any further increase in the pensionable age will require additional primary legislation to come before the House.</p><p>Part 5 of the Bill institutes a bereavement support payment.  The Committee expressed concern that unmarried couples would not benefit from that payment, and it urged the Department to investigate means of validating long-term relationships to allow payments to be made.  After all, it is important that the spirit of the bereavement support is upheld and that those most affected by loss are properly and, indeed, justly supported.</p><p>In conclusion, let me say that the Alliance Party supports the Bill at this stage, as well as the departmental amendments, which, as has been said, are mostly technical.  I urge the Department to continue to scrutinise the progress of the Bill's implementation, particularly for those groups that have been identified as most at risk of being considerably adversely affected.  We must ensure that our pension system is fit for purpose and fits the needs that the 21st century will place upon it.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Pensions Bill: Consideration Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for her statement this morning.

Our Chairman has already outlined in detail the many recommendations and our deliberations, so I will be brief but give support to the report.</p><p>Alliance believes that the report strikes a fair balance between accountability and independence.  Where greater accountability can be sought from the Attorney General, the report seeks to implement it.  For example, as has already been said, it recommends that the Attorney General be required to make a declaration of interests similar to that of MLAs.  This is a sensible move as the role of Attorney General is a public one and it is reasonable, therefore, that people should know what other interests, if any, a senior law officer should have.  Given that his or her advice is often used in political debates in favour of or against change, it seems reasonable that the source of that advice should be subject to transparency.</p><p>The report also recommends that there be a specific procedure to allow Committee scrutiny of the Attorney General following two specific events:  first, the tabling of the Attorney General's annual report; and, secondly, any referral of a Bill to the Supreme Court after the passage of Final Stage.  Both of these are areas where some form of improved accountability to the Assembly will be welcome.  Due to the technical detail of most of these discussions, a Committee would be best placed to hear those discussions.</p><p>However, as I outlined at the start, this report also strikes a fair balance with independence.  It is important that the Attorney General retains independence from the Assembly, as it is part of the job to speak impartially and fairly.  The position is also one that advises the Executive, rather than the Assembly.  Making a clear distinction will underline this independence of office.  That is why, at this stage, I am not at all convinced that there is a need to allocate the Attorney General any additional role in the Assembly.  It is appropriate, therefore, that the report recommends no change in this area.</p><p>In conclusion, the Attorney General has an important role in the political process.  However, it is a nuanced one.  That is why it is important that, at any given time, the balance is appropriately struck between accountability and independence.  This report manages to do that.

I support the comments of Se&#225;n Lynch; he outlined very well the Sinn F&#233;in position.  Fuel laundering is a criminal offence, and those who involve themselves in it, be it distribution or profiting from the business, should be arrested and face trial for that criminality.  Any member of the public with any information should come forward and give it to the PSNI.  I do not think that it can be put any more clearly than that.  Indeed, I appeal to people who sometimes find themselves in the trap of thinking that it is legitimate or OK to use laundered fuel to desist because if people did not use it, the demand would not be created.  That echoes the comments of our party colleagues in the Oireachtas &#8212; Gerry Adams, P&#225;draig Mac Lochlainn and Kathryn Reilly &#8212; who spoke recently in similar debates about closer cooperation to ensure that this type of activity is stamped out.</p><p>Other people this afternoon spoke about the other side of the criminal activity, and that is the damage to the environment.

I want to begin my remarks by extending my solidarity to the family of Adrian Carroll.  As we have said many times, I am sure that a debate such as this reminds the family of the trauma and grief that they are experiencing.  I am a bit perturbed that the proposer of the motion did not acknowledge that family in any way, but that follows the trend from the Adjournment debate in 2012, when not one Member from the unionist parties acknowledged the family at the heart of this.  Perhaps they might have the good grace to correct that today.</p><p>The motion asks that the Assembly:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes the miscarriage of justice in the case of the UDR four\".</p><p>Then the proposer came to the Floor and did not mention that case, except for Colin Worton, who was not designated by the campaign as one of the UDR four.  It amazes me that a person stands convicted, yet the proposer of the motion made no case for why that is a miscarriage of justice.</p><p>There is a case to be made that Mr Worton should be considered for compensation, and I will return to that.  As I have just pointed out, the motion is framed in a particular way.  Perhaps if the supporters of the motion had come here today and said that this case bore all the hallmarks of many cases that passed through Castlereagh and the Diplock courts, we would be having a different debate with a different outcome.  Therein lies the problem for us. Those who tabled the motion are trying to paint the scenario that this was somehow the only miscarriage of justice that went through the Diplock courts &#8212; far from it, and we have to address that as well.</p><p>That is against the backdrop over the last number of years, almost monthly, of cases that were referred to the Court of Appeal by the CCRC being overturned by that court, and the trial in that court pointing out abuses by the RUC, the British Army and, indeed, in times gone by, the PPS, yet those who tabled the motion take no recognition of that at all.  I think that, in these types of cases, you have to be able to say that, if the process was flawed then, the outcomes, on many occasions, were also flawed.

If you accept that, you also have to accept that it is a universal principle.  Many, many other cases went through the court system in which people were acquitted, and the trial judge pointed out that there were abuses by the RUC, yet those people were told that there was no legal redress.  Indeed, I refer to one case in which the witness was an agent of the state.  The trial judge called him a liar and said that he was unworthy of belief, fabricated evidence and was encouraged by the RUC to fabricate evidence against people.  All those people were acquitted in the first instance, yet not one of them received any compensation.  They were told that they were not permitted to do so legally.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: UDR Four"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I will indeed.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: UDR Four"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>That is an excellent point, and we should address it here today.

First, I welcome the report.  Indeed, I have been on the Assembly and Executive Review Committee since its inception a number of years ago, and I think that this will be seen as one of its better pieces of work.</p><p>I think that it is a comprehensive report, and I echo the sentiments of other Members about the quality of the research.  I was not on any of the trips, but the feedback from the trips showed us how other institutions can tackle this problem.  The research was not just about pointing out where inequalities existed but gave us templates for how things could be changed.  I think that the report is very important and provides an excellent snapshot of where the Assembly now sits.  I think that from reading it, it is fair to say that, while there are positive aspects of the work carried out here in the Assembly, we could and should be doing better.  That is the task ahead.</p><p>The other strength of the report is that we can see from the research and particularly the recommendations where we should go next.  I think that the report would not have the same meaning, effect or deep purpose if there was not provision for how we can tackle the issue.  I think that the question of how we change is the most important thing for the Committee, as it should be for all the parties in the Assembly.  There are very clear recommendations on what the Assembly can do to make the place more approachable and better for people with caring responsibilities.  Various parties have outlined some of the measures and some of the steps that can and should be taken in relation to this, which is very important.</p><p>I also think that we have to be very mindful and very careful that we do not believe that nothing needs to be changed or that, if we continue to do what we are doing, we will have different outcomes.  If we do believe that, we are certainly deluding ourselves.  Alastair Ross made the point that the population make-up is around 50:50, yet, when you look across many, many sectors &#8212; the Assembly is no different &#8212; you see a lower percentage of women.  That has to put us in a position where we are asking questions.  I do not think that you can retreat into the position where you say that it is all down to merit and that merit dictates it; that is too simplistic.</p><p>I think that we all know that, in certain institutions and with certain cultural values, you can use merit as a cover for prevailing and dominant views.  Indeed, the Lord Chief Justice has been in front of our Justice Committee, and, particularly at senior level, the legal profession has a complete predominance of men.  I think that he took the approach that, while he knows that people can retreat into saying that it is down to merit, there are certain procedures in place that can skew merit in a particular way.  He invited the Committee to invite him back in a number of years, and he said that, if he had not changed that, he would be open to criticism.  I think that that is the type of approach that we have to take, because, where there is an obvious bias and an obvious inequality, it is appropriate to take steps.  Other people in other institutions in other places have done that and done it quite successfully.  I think that people who try to defend the merit principle are frightened of positive and affirmative action.  I do not think affirmative action in any undermines anybody's position, particularly &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Women in Politics and the Northern Ireland Assembly: Review Report"}, {"date": "2015-03-09", "body": "<p>I think that every measure possible should be taken.

As I will say later on, it is important that we have not only debate about the issue but informed debate.  I come at it at a slight disadvantage as a member of the Education Committee in that these are issues that were discussed by the Committee at some length some time ago before I joined the Committee, so I am not privy to all the discussions that took place at that time.  However, I want to pick up on the fact that in the motion there is a word that is important for education:  the word \"inequality\".</p><p>One of the things that is very distinctive about our education provision in Northern Ireland is the range of sectors, the complex architecture that was developed over the years and some of its inbuilt inequalities.  We have a substantial number of sectors and a system that was there for 40 years from the creation of the education and library boards.  We are all very familiar with the difficulties that there were in reshaping and reconfiguring the architecture of education to create an Education Authority.  Once the whole issue started to be unpacked, suddenly a whole range of other things started to open up.  I am, however, keen to see that inequalities are addressed wherever they can be.  It is incumbent on us all to ensure that we commit ourselves to that.</p><p>I was interested in Mr Sheehan's comment that the certificate is the same as every other qualification.  I would suggest that it is not quite the same as every other qualification.  The fact that such strong views have been expressed today in favour of retaining it suggests that I am right in that assumption and that, contrary to what was said by Mr Sheehan, there is something unique and different in that it is something that is particular to one sector and for one sector alone.  That is why it is not the same as every other qualification.  It is unique, peculiar and distinctive to one sector; in this case, the Roman Catholic sector.  The comment was also made that some of the observations, critiques and comments were aimed solely at the Roman Catholic sector, but that is the very nature of the thing because it is a certificate for teaching religious education in a Roman Catholic ethos.</p><p>When I said earlier that it is not good enough just to have a debate and that it needs to be an informed debate, I would certainly want to be better informed as to why there has to be a certificate in religious education.  What is there in it that is not in any other primary education training for teachers?  Other teachers at primary level are taught and equipped to teach religious education with a syllabus which, apart from the sacramental element, is the same across all schools.</p><p>If that is the case, what is different, what is unique and why is there a need for that particular certificate?  People who are listening to the debate and who have a general interest in education may well ask who validates the certificate, who is authorised to deliver it and who authorises them to deliver it.  If somebody else were to create a certificate in religious education, who would decide whether that is acceptable or not?  That is why I say that I think that we need to have a debate about it, but it needs to be an informed debate.</p><p>Se&#225;n Rogers got very close to the point when he referred to the issue of sacramental education, because the earlier part of his justification for a certificate did not really stand up strongly, in that, as I have said already &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Teacher Employment: Inequality"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>Teachers elsewhere are learning those things for the primary teaching of RE.

It is important that we identify children with special needs at an early stage and that the needs of those children are addressed.  That is good for the child, for the parents, for the family from which they come and for society as a whole.</p><p>The figures that have been presented to us this morning by the Chair of the Committee and have been referenced by others in regard to the scale of the situation are indeed stark.  From a situation 10 years ago where 16% of the school population had special educational needs &#8212; one in six &#8212; we are now, 10 years later, at a figure of 22%, which is one in five and not far short of one in four.  When you look at those figures and the scale represented by them &#8212; 73,000 children with special educational needs &#8212; it leads on to this question: is that simply a reflection or result of better identification of children with special educational needs, or are there other issues here underlying it?  The careful analysis and examination of the background is important.  How does it compare with other areas of the United Kingdom and with other countries?  What are the comparisons across the Province?</p><p>The issue of budget has already been mentioned.  Of course, that has to be very much in our minds.  It is therefore important that, in the thinking of the Department, there is recognition of the importance of money being allocated in regard to SEN.  There are many things that we might want to do and that might seem desirable, but there are certain things that should be seen as priorities, and this is certainly one of them.  Yet the growth in the demand for SEN support services has undoubtedly placed a considerable burden on budgets for the education and library boards, and it will do so in the future for the Education Authority.</p><p>The need to improve the special educational needs situation is, I think, in the mind of most Members.  We all have constituents come into our office with concerns about problems that they have encountered in obtaining a statement of special educational needs for a child or, thereafter, in ensuring that the child receives the appropriate provision.  It is clear to us all from those experiences that the current situation is complex and that parents can often find it confusing, difficult and bureaucratic.  There is a recognition across the Assembly that there is a need for change.  Of course, the question then is what the nature of that change might be.  Our desire is that there should be a reduction in statementing timescales and that the process should be simpler and quicker than it is currently.  I hope therefore that what is eventually brought into law is not overly and unnecessarily bureaucratic.</p><p>In that regard, the changes to the appeal mechanism are welcome.  The proposal of an independent mediation service is a good development that will help to resolve disagreements more effectively.  An informal mediation system of the sort that we currently have is helpful, but it is clearly desirable that that be put on a more formal, independent footing.</p><p>We also have to keep in mind the balance between the primary legislation that we are looking at today and the anticipated secondary legislation.  Beyond that, there will be a consequent impact on the statutory SEN code of practice.  I know that the Committee will get briefings on the secondary legislation and so on after Easter and will have a better understanding then of where that is going.  There is a concern that we are seeing only part of the picture at this stage: we really need to see the bigger picture.  I hope that what is presented to the Committee after Easter will help provide that better understanding and better picture.  It is that absence of detail that makes the current situation somewhat difficult for us in the Assembly today and somewhat unsatisfactory for the Committee.  Although I totally support the general principle of the Bill, principle has to be followed by detail.</p><p>There is another point that I want to acknowledge. Postcode lotteries and inconsistencies across the five boards have been mentioned.  The creation of a single authority should address and improve that situation in part, but the pre-existing inconsistencies have certainly caused a degree of confusion among parents.</p><p>As I said, I support the general principle of the Bill.  It is good, and it is moving in the right direction, but the detail that needs to follow is hugely important.  We need to know exactly what is proposed and what the implications are.

That was the decision of the Equality Commission, yet Newry and Mourne councillors threw the Equality Commission recommendation aside.  When I thought about it, it occurred to me that, when it comes to Ashers bakery, the Equality Commission behaves like a salivating Rottweiler, and, when it comes to McCreesh park in Newry and Mourne, it is tentative at best and behaves more like a little lapdog.  Tom Elliott also reminded us that Raymond McCreesh had a choice; his victims had none.</p><p>Jim Allister said that Raymond McCreesh chose to be a terrorist.  He was guilty of conspiracy to murder and possession of weapons, and there is the link to the Kingsmills massacre.  He knew what he was doing and wanted to do it.  Sinn F&#233;in needed and wanted martyrs, and, therefore, the leadership of Sinn F&#233;in provided the hunger strike.</p><p>Mark Durkan, as Minister of the Environment, said that we need to move on.  How do we do it?  We can move on, first, by renaming McCreesh park.  We can also move on by not maintaining a liturgical calendar of murderous republicanism.  Last Sunday, Gerry Adams was in south Armagh, the same area, glorifying Brendan Burns and Brendan Moley, two IRA terrorists who managed to blow themselves up when they were handling a bomb and putting it into a car.  It turned out that one of them, Brendan Burns, had also had a connection, it seems, with the Narrow Water massacre, where 18 soldiers were murdered by the IRA, the worst single atrocity directed against the British Army in the Troubles.  That is the sort of person who was eulogised and glorified by Gerry Adams on Sunday.</p><p>Castlederg is another example.  We seem to have week after week after week after week of the Sinn F&#233;in leadership keeping faith with the past, bound to the past and bound into that republican philosophy that, somehow or other, in certain circumstances, it is all right to kill.  They seem to be unable to break free from the past and move forward, and the danger with all of this is that those who look and those who listen are from a younger generation.  We have already heard from a younger generation today, and some in that younger generation will say. \"If it was all right for them to do it, why can we not do it?\".

He reflected on the fact that, whilst the Equality Commission had pursued a bakery with the speed of light, it had been somewhat ineffective in regard to its dealings with Newry and Mourne District Council.  He also pointed out that there was a lack of respect shown by those who supported the name McCreesh park, and that the weapon that was identified with McCreesh was one that had also been used in that appalling murder of 10 Protestant workmen at Kingsmills.  We were also reminded that this name was put up in 2001 under a Newry and Mourne District Council that was dominated by the SDLP.  That was referred to by a number of other Members.</p><p>Megan Fearon from Sinn F&#233;in eulogised Raymond McCreesh and, as was pointed out by another Member, it was quite appalling to find the youngest Member of this Assembly, someone from a younger generation, pouring out the same poison that has been passed down from generation to generation by murderous militant republicanism.  Someone asked who had written her speech.  I do not know who wrote it, but I will say this much:  she certainly managed to regurgitate quite a bit of what Conor Murphy said on 'The Stephen Nolan Show' this morning.  It was almost word-for-word perfect.  She referred to Sir James Craig and said that he was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the man who brought the gun into Irish politics\".</p><p>The first time I heard that was from a civil servant from Dublin, but I heard it today from Megan Fearon.  It was not true when the Dublin civil servant said it, and it is no more true when Megan Fearon says it.  It is as though, somehow or other, the Irish Republican Brotherhood and its murderous campaigns in the 19th century, long before Sir James Craig was even born, can be simply written out of history.  Not only did it bring the gun into Irish politics, it certainly also brought the bomb into Irish politics big style, when it organised its dynamite campaign on the British mainland and murdered quite a number of people in the course of it.  So it was disappointing &#8212; very disappointing &#8212; and alarming to hear those words from Megan Fearon and this attempt to rewrite history.  Interestingly enough, the points that she makes are obviously part of a narrative that has been worked out by Sinn F&#233;in, as they try to rewrite history and excuse and explain away what they have done.</p><p>Alasdair McDonnell said that \"pain has no politics\".

She talked about John Martin and various places in Newry that are named after earlier republicans of the 19th century:  John Martin; John Mitchel; and others.  This year, the republican movement will be celebrating the bicentenary of John Mitchel, who was not only an Irish republican but an advocate of slavery.  Although, since Sinn F&#233;in can manage to celebrate, eulogise and glorify a Nazi collaborator in Dublin, dealing with somebody who was an advocate of slavery should not be too much of a problem for them.</p><p>Danny Kennedy spoke as a former councillor and said that he had long opposed &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: McCreesh Park"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>The story of Nazi collaboration and the IRA's collaboration with Adolf Hitler is well known.</p><p>Danny Kennedy reminded us how, as a councillor, he had long opposed this in Newry and Mourne and said, quite rightly, that it is just plain wrong and deeply offensive, and it is deeply offensive to decent people.  IRA actions were murder and terrorism.  There is nothing there to celebrate, and all true democrats will endorse those words.</p><p>Trevor Lunn referred to Kingsmills.  In 1976, 10 innocent Protestant people were murdered there by the IRA, and there was linkage to Raymond McCreesh and the weapon that he was carrying.  There was also criticism of the Equality Commission, which he described as being worse than lethargic, its inactivity on a grand scale.  It took the SDLP 14 years to do the right thing, but, like Trevor Lunn, I welcome the fact that it is now in a better place.</p><p>My colleague William Humphrey referred to a number of issues.  He highlighted the weakness of the SDLP and the comments of one of its councillors Kate Loughran who previously backed the name \"McCreesh\".  It was an odious decision, he said, and he said that the party had lost its moral compass.  Actions speak louder than words, and, hopefully now, the moral compass is starting maybe to come back.</p><p>Mickey Brady told us that Raymond McCreesh is not, was not and never will be a terrorist.  However, I think that most people will take the view that, if someone acts like a terrorist and if someone murders like a terrorist, he probably is a terrorist.</p><p>Sammy Wilson referred to the youngest Member of the Assembly, and asked, \"Is this what our society has come to?\".  He drew the parallel with the actions of the three teenage girls from England who have gone to join Islamic State.  Outside Northern Ireland, he said, people will look on in horror, and he described Newry and Mourne as a political cesspit.  The SDLP is belatedly allowing itself to be dragged on, and he referred to the fact that one SDLP councillor said that it was a \"healing process\" to name the park after a terrorist.</p><p>Raymond McCartney expressed solidarity with Raymond McCreesh's family; he had known them, and he said that republicans were unbowed and unbroken.  I wonder:  did Raymond McCreesh and other hunger strikers really die so that Sinn F&#233;in Members could administer British rule in a devolved Assembly under a sovereign Parliament at Westminster where they have to send every Bill for the Royal Assent of Her Majesty the Queen?  We are still in the United Kingdom, so I wonder whether that is really what those folk died for.</p><p>Dominic Bradley, in a wide-ranging speech, gave us a little bit about Mickey Brady's history and then spoke about a shared future.  He said that it is time to move on and that no public space should be named after someone who has been guilty of unlawful violence.  It is good that he is there; there is just therefore the difficulty that it took the SDLP 14 years to get there.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: McCreesh Park"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>Will the Member give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: McCreesh Park"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>As a member of the Education Committee and a former science teacher, I support the motion.  It is a very relevant motion.  The subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM as we describe them, are extremely important, and the motion refers to a number of recent reports and evaluations that emphasise the importance of children having access to and a good knowledge of those subjects.</p><p class=\"italic\">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Beggs] in the Chair)</p><p>The inspectorate has said that STEM subjects are important, the sector has said that they are important and the Committee and common sense would say that they are important as well.  The motion calls on the Minister to support the schools and the system to:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"encourage the full implementation of the STEM aspects of the curriculum in order to bring about high quality learning for all children.\"</p><p>We know that the Minister will have a number of priorities and things that he wants to happen and be done during his tenure in office.  I sincerely hope that that is one of them and that he will make the teaching of STEM subjects one of his priorities.</p><p>The motion also states that STEM subjects are a \"key driver of the economy\".  They are a growth area for the economy.  If that is the case, and if we want to address issues of unemployment, particularly among younger people, surely we do not want to put ourselves in a situation where we have to bring into Northern Ireland young people with the requisite skills in those areas to fill the opportunities that there are in a range of businesses in the STEM areas.  We should be in a position where young people here are available with the skills to take up the jobs that are being created and to help to create more jobs in what is clearly a key driver for the economy and a growth area.</p><p>STEM subjects tend to be focused on at secondary level.  However, as the motion implies, they also have a relevance in primary schools.  The Royal Society of Chemistry, along with other scientific organisations, have stressed the importance of that subject in primary as well as secondary schools.  The Committee sincerely hopes that the Minister will throw his full weight, his full support and his full resources behind STEM subjects to ensure that they are taught at primary and secondary level and that all aspects of the reports and the evaluations by the inspectorate are taken into account in so doing.</p><p>It was touched on, maybe a little bit humorously, earlier that there is an opportunity to say to young people in Northern Ireland that there are good examples that can be an encouragement and perhaps even an inspiration to them.  The IT link across the Atlantic with America is referred to as Project Kelvin.  One of the great things about Lord Kelvin was that, not only was he a theoretical scientist, he was a very practical scientist who created many different inventions and so on.  We should also keep it in mind that there is a value in making children in schools more aware of the scientific, technical, engineering and mathematical heritage of Ulster, which has produced so many significant figures in those areas.</p><p>It would be remiss of me to simply leave it with Lord Kelvin.  We might also refer to Sir Samuel Davidson and the Sirocco Works.  He was a pre-eminent engineer with so many different and diverse inventions to his name.  He was also the proprietor of a major engineering works that not only produced goods in Belfast but exported them around the world.  Belfast was very much a centre of engineering and of invention and innovation.  We might also think of Harry Ferguson, the engineer who made such a significant contribution in the agricultural field.  For the benefit of Mr Hazzard, who is no longer with us, the common theme across Sir Samuel Davidson, Harry Ferguson and Lord Kelvin is not simply their engineering expertise but the fact that they were staunch unionists and very much in support of Ulster and the union &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: STEM in Schools"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>I am sure that Mr Hazzard will want to take that to heart.</p><p>I support the motion and hope that the Minister will take it to heart.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: STEM in Schools"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>Will the Member give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: STEM in Schools"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>Does the Member share my appreciation of the fact that, when he mentions William Thomson &#8212; Lord Kelvin &#8212; Hans Sloane and Francis Hutcheson, he mentions three of the individuals who are pre-eminent in the contribution of the Ulster Scots to the history of Northern Ireland?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: STEM in Schools"}, {"date": "2015-02-16", "body": "<p>The Committee was briefed by the Minister in early October 2014, and, at that stage, members began to probe what the likely size and impact of the reduction to the departmental budget would be.  At that stage, the Minister did not know the exact size of the reduction.  However, she indicated that the departmental arm's-length bodies had been instructed to make plans for savings at a variety of different levels.  The Committee ascertained at that stage that a strategic approach to budget reductions, rather than a simple salami-slicing exercise, would be taken by the Minister and her arm's-length bodies.  The Committee also heard from some of the Department's arm's-length bodies on how they will seek to manage reductions to their budgets in the year ahead.</p><p>Throughout the budget reduction process, the Committee has stressed that reductions must be applied as part of a strategy that seeks to protect front-line services to our communities and to support the Department's stated objective of promoting equality and tackling poverty and social exclusion.  The Committee began its scrutiny of the draft DCAL budget for 2015-16 on 25 November and heard from officials about the Department's plans for the allocated budget reduction.  We were then briefed on the content of the consultation.  The Committee subsequently received a summary of the responses to the original draft Budget consultation.  In addition, at the Committee's meeting on Thursday, it received and considered a further budget paper from the Department.  It sets out the Department's savings delivery plans, impact assessments of the budget reductions and risk management plans, as well as those of its arm's-length bodies.  The Committee has also written to the DCAL's arm's-length bodies for more detailed savings delivery plans and will seek to be briefed on those in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Like all Members, I and the Committee would prefer that budget reductions did not have to be made.</p><p>However, Northern Ireland is subject to the same financial realities as the rest of the developed world and is subject to the same pain in the wake of financial crises that are beyond our control.</p><p>The Committee also considered reductions to the DCAL budget from the perspective of ensuring that no aspects of the Department's remit are so hollowed out that they are damaged beyond repair.  That is not an easy task.  DCAL has a relatively small budget, and the reduction may also seem small in terms of the overall Budget at the Executive's disposal.  However, the Department is facing a 10% budget reduction compared with the 2014-15 budget, and that will inevitably cause pain.</p><p>The Committee welcomes the fact that the initial budget reduction was lessened by the Executive finding a further almost &#163;2 million for DCAL.  That will go towards addressing inescapable pressures in the Department and to NI Screen for its skills development work, including Cinemagic.  Therefore, rather than the budget of &#163;89&#183;9 million as first anticipated, DCAL will have a current expenditure budget of &#163;91&#183;7 million for 2015-16.</p><p>As a result of delays to the Casement Park development, the DCAL capital investment allocation for 2015-16 will be &#163;8&#183;1 million, not the &#163;54&#183;1 million first envisaged.  The Committee has put on record its concerns around the delays on Casement Park having a knock-on impact on the other aspects of the Executive's regional and subregional stadium programme.  It is important to the Committee that work continues, and members were pleased to note an allocation of &#163;630,000 for the development of the subregional stadium plan in the January monitoring round.  The Committee is probing how that money will be spent and what work that will entail.</p><p>The upshot of the Executive's reconsideration of the DCAL budget means that the reduction amounts to 8&#183;2%, rather than 10%.  There will be a reduction to the Libraries NI budget of 7&#183;5% and reductions of 11&#183;2% in all other areas.  The core departmental budget of &#163;19&#183;6 million includes the additional allocation for the development of the subregional stadium plan and &#163;500,000 for essential building overheads at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI).  The Department intends to manage its budget reduction through decreasing its pay bill by &#163;1&#183;4 million, reducing grants and programmes by &#163;867,000, and reducing overheads by &#163;100,000.</p><p>The Committee accepts the need for the Department to reduce administration costs to more manageable levels.  Members hope that that can be achieved equitably and sensibly through a voluntary exit scheme for staff and other measures.  The Committee will scrutinise reductions to the core programme budget in the months ahead.</p><p>We also commend the efforts that have been made by the Executive and the Minister to minimise the reduction to the Libraries NI budget.  That will now amount to 7&#183;5%, and it is anticipated that no libraries will have to close.  However, temporary and relief staff will go, opening hours will reduce and the budget for new stock will see a considerable fall.  The Committee has been a strong supporter of our libraries and believes that they are not only at the heart of our communities but that they can further be developed as venues and hubs for arts and culture.  That could provide new revenue streams and, potentially, allow for longer opening.  The reduction of almost &#163;2&#183;4 million will leave Libraries NI with a budget of &#163;29&#183;4 million for 2015-16.</p><p>The Arts Council sought to minimize the impact of in-year budget reductions over the last year on its clients by absorbing those internally.  The Committee applauds that principled approach.  However, it will not be possible for the body to absorb the &#163;1&#183;4 million budget reduction it faces in 2015-16.  Over &#163;1&#183;1 million will be reduced from intended grants, as well as pay bill and administrative cost reductions of almost &#163;250,000.</p><p>The Committee knows that the Arts Council intends to approach grants reductions in a strategic way that will seek to minimise the impact on the body's overall strategic functions, and members commend that.  However, its budget of &#163;11&#183;1 million going into 2015-16 will create tremendous challenges, and the Committee is hopeful that an upcoming Executive arts and culture strategy may see greater cross-departmental funding of arts and culture, which could see overall funding for the sectors increase.</p><p>Sport NI's budget reduction for 2015-16 of just over &#163;1 million will see decreases in grants and performance and coaching activities of &#163;800,000; it will also see the body reducing its administrative overheads by &#163;250,000.  However, Members are aware that the body has exciting plans in the year ahead that will see greater cooperation with the new super-councils.  It is to be hoped that economies of scale, together with the pooling of resources, will ensure that ambition in sport here will not be diminished.</p><p>The North/South language bodies and Waterways Ireland, while outside the scope of this budget reduction exercise, will see their budgets fall by over &#163;1 million collectively, as agreed at the relevant North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings.</p><p>Armagh Observatory and Armagh Planetarium will go into 2015-16 with a budget of &#163;1&#183;4 million, a reduction of over &#163;170,000 on this year.  With such a small budget to start with, it is imperative that the impact of the reduction on the bodies' budget be carefully monitored so that it does not have a disproportionate impact.  The Committee places considerable value on the work of those bodies and appreciates the global reputation that they enjoy.</p><p>As I have already indicated, NI Screen has benefited from additional funding from the Executive to ensure that inescapable pressures can be met.  The Committee welcomes this.  The Northern Ireland Museums Council must find savings of &#163;30,000.  However, the Committee is discussing options with the body, and the Department and members are hopeful that solutions can be found.</p><p>Inevitably, important programmes and projects are lost when budgets are reduced.  However, we must all become more creative and collaborative in our use of funding and look to other sources of revenue.  In that context, the Committee was briefed last week by the EU unit of Belfast City Council.  There was a general belief that more could be done in accessing money and resources from that source.  We were impressed by the unit's success in placing, effectively, this work &#8212; EU networks and policy development &#8212; at the heart of what it does.  It really does provide a model that Departments and the new super-councils could learn from.  There is no alternative to new ways of thinking about funding, and the Committee is keen to play its part.</p><p>We face difficult financial times, and it will be difficult for a number of these arm's-length bodies over the coming year.

How many people have been to CERN, built by a Northern Ireland man, to see what it is about?  How many people have been to the Science Museum in London?  How many people have listened to NASA?  How many people know that 1&#183;46 million people in the UK are employed in IT and that 1&#183;2 billion tech jobs have not been filled worldwide?  Those issues show why we must get more people involved.</p><p>I got a very nice email from Roisin Crawford, whom Members from the north-west will know as the person who runs STEM Aware.  She mentioned the Northern Ireland primary school curriculum, saying that little science is required with even less practised.  She also says that some older teachers practise, but others never did science.  I think that the Minister has to take it on board that science has been hit by the fact that the unofficial 11-plus tests do not deal with science.  If it is not measured, it does not get taught, so there is a problem coming through in the next three or four years.</p><p>It is interesting that Roisin, being a female engineer, also said that she did not think that we should have a go at girls specifically as part of the gender balance but we should point it out to them that they have an unfair advantage in the jobs market.  People are desperate to get women into science, IT and all those areas.</p><p>There is an issue with Sentinus that I want to deal with.  I hope that the Minister will tell us that a bit more funding on that is coming through.  It is an excellent exercise.  I also wonder how many Members went down to the BT Young Scientists and Technology Exhibition.  I listened to Jennifer McKinley, who is a senior lecturer in the school of geography, archaeology and palaeocology.  What has that got to do with anything?  She is a world expert in forensic science, that is what.  We have got to push our really good people.  I have to say to Members that it is all very well trotting out the fine words, having the speech and doing all those things, but I wish that a few more of you could find your way to joining the excellent APG on science and technology, getting involved in the science debate and going along to all these great things.

Normally, whenever you are further down the list you have less to say.  I will stick with the less-to-say option and, hopefully, ensure that this debate is over sooner rather than later.</p><p>In this debate, we have to give some serious consideration to the fiscal powers that we already have.  We may not have corporation tax powers yet, but that time is not too far away.  As I have done before, I commend the Finance Minister for working with his Executive colleagues to ensure that we get the devolution of corporation tax powers to Northern Ireland.</p><p>We may have agreement on devolving corporation tax powers, but the one thing that is still outstanding, is very important and needs to be dealt with if we want to be taken seriously in respect of our ability to utilise our fiscal powers is the setting of the rate of corporation tax and the date for its implementation.  The rate is important to ensuring that we can compete with our neighbours, the Republic of Ireland.  There is some debate around whether the rate should be 12&#183;5% or 10%, but the fact that we are getting the power ensures that we have urgency around deciding the rate.</p><p>That is important in the context of the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Minister &#8212; I declare an interest as the Minister's APS &#8212; having within her responsibility the economy and the importance of growing the private sector.  If we cannot get early agreement on the rate and date, we lessen Invest NI's ability to go across the world and sell our rate of corporation tax to companies to try to encourage them to invest in Northern Ireland and benefit from our lower level of corporation tax.  So, it is important that we give Invest NI the earliest opportunities to present Northern Ireland as a place to invest and a place to come and set up business and benefit from our lower level of corporation tax.  It is incumbent upon Members across the Chamber to sit down with the Finance Minister and other Executive Ministers to get agreement on the rate that we are going to set and the time frame for doing it.</p><p>At least Sinn F&#233;in are consistent in their call for more fiscal powers.  They do not necessarily tell us what they are, how much they will cost or any of those things, but they are consistent nonetheless in saying that we should devolve more fiscal powers to Northern Ireland.  It is important, when we look at the powers we have and how good we are at utilising them, that we realise that that does not necessarily mean that we should devolve more.</p><p>Looking at the Alliance Party's amendment, it is important that people out there realise the Alliance Party is really about increasing the rates that people pay for their water.  It is also happy to end free transport for the elderly and many other things that will hurt the people of Northern Ireland.  As for free transport for the elderly, I know many people in my constituency who do not have high salaries and benefit daily from going out, meeting other people and going on day trips, which gives them an opportunity to spend some time together.  The Alliance Party's amendment is a disgrace and is something that we certainly will not be supporting.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant: Reductions"}, {"date": "2015-02-16", "body": "<p>It is not on the news.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Budget Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-16", "body": "<p>Will the Member give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Budget Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-16", "body": "<p>The Member talks about people being disingenuous in how they vote on councils.

This is my first opportunity to put on record my congratulations to you on gaining the position of Principal Deputy Speaker.</p><p>A lot has been said throughout the last few weeks in respect of the debates on budgets and whatnot.  Rehearsing a lot of that today is probably unnecessary, and I will try my best to avoid it.  There are some issues that need to be addressed.  Michaela Boyle, across the way, tried to give us many a good reason why we should have more fiscal powers in Northern Ireland.</p><p>If we look at what we have and what we are due in the not-too-distant future when we will be dealing with corporation tax, we should take one at a time and see how we get on.  Some Members believe that corporation tax should not be devolved, but the debate has long since moved on to the rate at which we set it.</p><p>We are looking at the wider context of our Budgets and how we set things.  The Minister will no doubt look at rates and issues to do with rates.  We need to address those as they affect people in our constituencies.  In my constituency, I find it very difficult to understand why we talk about devolving more fiscal powers, given those that we have already, including the ability of councils to set rates.  In my council area &#8212; the new Mid Ulster Council &#8212; Sinn F&#233;in, backed by the SDLP, which holds the balance, increased the rates burden by 5&#183;81% in Dungannon, 5&#183;63% in Magherafelt and 2&#183;74% in Cookstown.  We are asking for more powers &#8212; Sinn F&#233;in certainly has it on record that it wants as many powers devolved as possible &#8212; yet we cannot even strike a rate in councils in the best interests of our constituents or ask council officials to try to cut their cloth to ensure as low an increase as possible.  No one will tell me, after 12 and a half years' experience, that there was never any cloth to be cut.</p><p>It is important, therefore, that we look at the wider context.  If we are to devolve additional fiscal powers, we have to get better at exercising the powers that we already have, such as setting the rates.  I understand that, in other council areas across Northern Ireland, rates have been cut or frozen.  Mid Ulster and Fermanagh and Omagh councils are no different in having that responsibility.  In the new Mid Ulster Council, Sinn F&#233;in, backed by the SDLP, is more interested in the Irish language and other things than the delivery of key services.  If that is the lesson to be learned from the way in which we exercise our fiscal responsibilities, I am not sure that everyone has grasped how best to do so.  In the past few days, I have not heard from one constituent who is happy with the increase, and I, speaking on behalf of my party and the Ulster Unionist Party, which also opposed the increases, think that it is incumbent on those parties who voted through the increase to tell people exactly why they did so.</p><p>I contributed to one of the Budget debates, when an Ulster Unionist Party amendment proposed to take &#163;26 million out of the social investment fund.  I will not rehearse all the issues, but I still have not heard how the Ulster Unionists proposed to do that.  Twenty six million pounds is allocated to the social investment fund.  From my constituency's perspective, there is &#163;1&#183;4 million of committed spend.  Had the Ulster Unionist Party's amendment been accepted, where was the &#163;1&#183;4 million going to be found?  I discussed it with the Finance Minister, who told me that he had allocated &#163;26 million &#8212; no other money &#8212; to the social investment fund.  This is basic mathematics:  if you take &#163;26 million away from &#163;26 million, there is nothing left.  I still have not found a valid explanation of where we would have found the additional &#163;1&#183;4 million for the projects in my constituency.</p><p>All in all, I commend the Finance Minister for the efforts that he put in to bring us to this point.  He spent many hours trying to ensure that we had enough money to pay for all the services and ensure that front-line services were kept, certainly in the education sector.  I commend him for all the work that he has done, and I wish him well as he continues to do the job.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Budget Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-10", "body": "<p>Will the Minister give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Welfare Reform Bill: Consideration Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-10", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for giving way.

It is about this Assembly and about the Northern Ireland Executive and how we conduct ourselves, how we advance healing and actively promote reconciliation in a traumatised and post-conflict society.  Quite frankly, it is about whether we care about the others or whether we just want to pay lip service to reconciliation.</p><p>The absence of violence alone is by no means an indication of peace.  My party, the SDLP, fully recognises the hurt, pain and distress that this issue and similar issues can cause however and wherever they present themselves.  Pain has no politics, no religion, no shape and no form.  We all suffer pain, and we all bleed when we are cut.</p><p>The naming of public spaces after individuals or groups involved in state or paramilitary violence can cause, and is often intended to cause, so much further hurt and distress to victims and survivors and their families.  It becomes yet another barrier for us to overcome in dealing with the past, and the reconciliation of the past in our society is a core principle of the SDLP, against which we measure what we do and what we say.  It is for this reason that the SDLP believes that violence must not be endorsed or glorified, even retrospectively.

It was very clear then &#8212; and I am very clear now &#8212; that John is an outstanding choice for Speaker.  That is why we have put his name forward.  As a Deputy Speaker, he has given this Assembly and its Members exemplary service over the past seven years, showing leadership, integrity, impartiality and good judgement at all times.</p><p>John has further shown his ability and capacity to take on the role of Speaker as and when required.  In October, I pointed out &#8212; it is worth repeating now &#8212; that John Dallat's long and dedicated service to the Assembly has given him wide and comprehensive experience of all the procedural and corporate functions of that office.  At that time, I was disappointed that other parties allowed narrow party political self-interest to stand in the way of John's election.  It seems that little has changed.  It appears that the DUP and Sinn F&#233;in have re-concocted their secret arrangements.  This secret arrangement is designed to exclude the rest of us in the Assembly.  In the light of those side deals and secret deals, and at a time when public confidence in the Assembly is at an all-time low, it is even more crucial to have someone of the calibre of John Dallat as Speaker.  It is time that we moved to an open and transparent system of government here without back-door or side deals designed to shut out full inclusion and full democracy.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Assembly Business: Standing Order 20(1): Suspension &#8212; Election of Speaker"}], "title": "", "house": "3", "image": "/images/mpsL/11402.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:29", "image_width": 88, "person_id": "11402", "entered_reason": "election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Alasdair McDonnell", "member_id": "90440", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Social Democratic and Labour Party", "constituency": "Belfast South"}, {"left_reason": "dissolution", "first_name": "Alasdair", "last_name": "McDonnell", "left_house": "2011-03-24", "title": "", "house": "3", "image": "/images/mpsL/11402.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:29", "image_width": 88, "person_id": "11402", "entered_reason": "election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Alasdair McDonnell", "member_id": "90308", "entered_house": "2007-03-09", "party": "Social Democratic and Labour Party", "constituency": "Belfast South"}, {"left_reason": "dissolution", "first_name": "Alasdair", "last_name": "McDonnell", "left_house": "2007-01-30", "title": "", "house": "3", "image": "/images/mpsL/11402.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:29", "image_width": 88, "person_id": "11402", "entered_reason": "general_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Alasdair McDonnell", "member_id": "90199", "entered_house": "2003-11-26", "party": "Social Democratic and Labour Party", "constituency": "Belfast South"}, {"left_reason": "general_election", "first_name": "Alasdair", "last_name": "McDonnell", "left_house": "2003-04-28", "title": "Dr", "house": "3", "image": "/images/mpsL/11402.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:29", "image_width": 88, "person_id": "11402", "entered_reason": "general_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Dr Alasdair McDonnell", "member_id": "90076", "entered_house": "1998-06-25", "party": "Social Democratic and Labour Party", "constituency": "Belfast South"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Barry", "last_name": "McElduff", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>1.

At the outset, I, too, want to thank the Clerk and staff of the Committee, as well as our Chairperson, Anna Lo, and Deputy Chairperson, Pamela Cameron, for their leadership throughout the inquiry.  I endorse the Chair's statement ahead of today's debate, which essentially calls for a more strategic approach in the siting of wind infrastructure and an urgent review of current noise guidelines.</p><p>I suppose that the recommendations contained in the report constitute advice to government, principally to the Minister of the Environment and the Department generally.  Yesterday, a Sinn F&#233;in delegation met the Minister and senior planning officials from his Department, and they have undertaken to give full and thorough consideration to the report.  They would have liked the timing to be different, as, with the development of the single planning policy statement and the report being almost coincidental, they are unable at this point to take full account of the recommendations in our report.</p><p>I refer to paragraph 3 of the report.  My party is supportive of Programme for Government targets, but my colleague Cathal Boylan made the point earlier that we cannot ignore the concerns of local residents who have questioned the way in which that target is being achieved through an over-reliance on wind energy and an underemphasis on and underutilisation of other renewable energy sources.</p><p>What about the key conclusions and recommendations?  In paragraph 18, there is specific mention of my constituency of West Tyrone and the issue of saturation point.  In paragraph 22, there is reference to a cumulative impact and saturation point in the number of wind developments that are either operational in or planned for an area.  Paragraph 18 highlights the fact that, hitherto, there has been a lack of a strategic approach to zoning or identifying the most appropriate locations for wind turbines.</p><p>I am aware of a number of large-scale applications in the pipeline.  One of those is described as Doraville, and it has wide implications for communities in the Glenelly valley in south Derry and the part of the Sperrins in Broughderg.  Indeed, I helped to facilitate a pre-application hearing for residents in respect of that application, and the scale of it is most worrying.  I want to commend the local group of residents from the Lisnaharney area, which is in close proximity to Gortin, who have a very positive and proactive community development agenda for that beautiful part of the Sperrins near Gortin.  Their plan for the future to create jobs and build tourism is based largely on exploiting the outdoor recreation potential of that area, and, in their submission, they point to the detrimental impact on visual amenity of a large-scale wind farm application and possible displacement of jobs in the tourism sector.</p><p>On the one hand, the industry will emphasise jobs created by wind farms and, on the other hand, groups like Lisnaharney Area Residents Group will emphasise displacement of jobs through lost tourism potential.</p><p>Reference is made in paragraphs 10 and 11 to wind turbine regulations &#8212; ETSU-97 or ETSU-R-97 &#8212; and there is general agreement that these need to be reviewed, that local government authorities and environmental health departments are far too stretched by regularly adjudicating on such matters and that perhaps there should be more of an onus on developers to prove that the noise regulations are being adhered to.</p><p>There are many questions for the Minister.

It is important to reflect on the fact that we are talking about older people in care homes and institutional settings.  Allegations of abuse have risen quite dramatically over the past three years, and that is a disgrace.  We are in a position to do something about it.  Guidance has been in place since 2010.  The Commissioner for Older People is now saying that it is time for legislation, which I also support.  It is important to bring forward that legislation.</p><p>In an institutional setting, whether a care home or a nursing home, we have the capacity to deal with the issue, not least because staff there can be registered, trained and properly inspected.  It is probably easier to oversee that setting and ensure that the vulnerable elderly population in it are properly protected.  In investigations of abuse, around 50% of cases are in care home settings.</p><p>Most of our elderly population are not in care homes but in their own homes.  Indeed, the whole thrust of health provision is to keep individuals in their own homes for as long as possible.  It is much more difficult to provide protection for vulnerable adults and frail elderly people in that type of setting.  Very often, the abuse comes from family members in the form of physical, financial and emotional abuse and neglect.  It is most difficult to provide protection.  That is where we need legislation, penalties, as Mr Poots said, and proper investigations to ensure that we provide the best protections we can.</p><p>The elderly population is growing:  the demographics are quite clear.  Most older people will be supported in their own homes for most of the last third of their lives, and our responsibility lies there.  I am concerned that domiciliary care packages will be cut back, because it is about more than the simple physical provision of various personal services.  It is also about staff going into people's homes and having time to spend with the individuals to talk to them and to ensure that they are in good heart and are not being subjected to any form of abuse as far as they can possibly determine.  I have always seen that type of inspection by our domiciliary care providers as a key part of the protections for our elderly population.  One visit a day is certainly inadequate.  Domiciliary care packages have been squeezed over the past number of months and longer, but they provide much more than simple physical support for our elderly:  they are also a means of protection.</p><p>I have no problem in supporting this.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and what the thinking of the Department is now.  It was very much in favour of guidance when I was in his shoes.  I assume that he will come forward with ideas for legislation, but legislation on its own will not do it.  Legislation has to be backed up.  We need to hear what sort of support the Department is proposing to put in place to deal with the situation.  The evidence suggests that abuse has virtually doubled &#8212; and that is in the institutional setting, so we can imagine that in the private home setting the problem is probably much greater.

Gabhaim bu&#237;ochas leis na daoine a chuir an r&#250;n seo os &#225;r gcomhair.  Thanks very much to those who brought the motion.  It is a very topical and important issue that affects many people's lives in the literal sense of the word &#8212; the very literal sense of the word.</p><p>I support the SDLP amendment, which aims to ensure that the National Crime Agency deploys its full powers and resources against any and all persons and organisations involved in fuel laundering.  We are talking about a massive criminal empire with tentacles that, in some instances, have been there for 30 or 40 years.  It is important that resources are deployed to tackle the difficulties that fuel laundering is creating for many people &#8212; the poison, the dumping and the cost to the public purse.  Indeed, it is also important to tackle the assets that have been accrued over many years by those criminals, sometimes fronting as patriots.</p><p>The SDLP has been at the forefront of NCA negotiations.  We secured accountability on the National Crime Agency.  In early February, we voted for the NCA to have full powers in Northern Ireland.  That vote was possible after lengthy negotiations by our party.  We have ensured that the NCA will work here in the North.  The Home Secretary has made a lot of commitments on the NCA.  The SDLP notes those commitments and intends to ensure that they are honoured.  If the public are to accept and trust the NCA, it needs to prove that no one person or organisation is off limits or protected when it comes to criminal assets.  They must be pursued and prosecuted.  We are calling for a demonstration that that is the case.</p><p>Turning to the motion, I am very concerned about the high levels of organised crime across this island.  In 2013-14, 38 fuel laundering plants were closed.  Although that was an increase on the previous year, we should be very wary, as the oil and fuel laundering plants have become larger and more sophisticated.  The process of fuel laundering has definitely become more industrialised.  There is a very unusual feature about raids made on these premises.  Have you noticed the number of times that there does not seem to be anybody there?  Nobody seems to be about.  Computers, oddly or quirkily enough, have either been scrubbed or have disappeared just before the raid is made.</p><p>On illegal waste dumping, the increased cost of the legitimate disposal of wastage caused a black market development.  Those who are involved in this show no concern for the environmental damage done:  absolutely none.  Their actions include pumping directly into the Fane and Lough Ross water systems for Dundalk and Crossmaglen; dumping in disused quarries and bogs, all of which leak into the shallow drumlin water table; and disposal along roads via tubes hooked up to containers in the backs of vans.  More worryingly for Irish agriculture, in some cases &#8212; thank God most of our farmers and members of the farming community are highly responsible &#8212; it is being mixed with slurry and spread over fields.  Apparently, there was a situation last month in the Knockbridge area, south-west of Dundalk, where it stank for over a week.  The fumes were smelt as far away as Dundalk after that happened.  That is the sort of activity that is ongoing to fuel the build-up of assets of those criminals and fuel their property empires at extreme cost to our environment and, worse again, to our animals and, more importantly, human beings.</p><p>Organised crime is not confined by geographical boundaries.  Cross-border crime presents serious threats to the economic prosperity of our country and risks to the population.  The SDLP believes that more needs to be done to tackle cross-border crime and criminal organisations.  We need to disrupt and dismantle these organised crime groups, which are engaged in or are seeking to engage in fuel laundering and the smuggling of tobacco, alcohol, drugs and counterfeit goods as they add to their existing asset bases and empires.</p><p>Only last month, there was a debate on cross-border crime in the House of Commons.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>Will the Member give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>Thanks very much.  I have it from good, reliable sources that the toxic waste that is produced is being pumped directly into the water system for Dundalk and Crossmaglen.  In fact, it is poisoning people.  These people are poisoning their neighbours, friends and family with this stuff because they want to cream off extortionate amounts for themselves.  That is seriously not on, and I am glad that the motion is before us today.

Cuirim f&#225;ilte roimh an deis labhairt sa d&#237;osp&#243;ireacht seo.  I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate.</p><p>I will be speaking primarily on the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee's European priorities for 2015, but, initially, as a Member, I want to take a moment to look at what we in the North get from our membership of the European Union.  Those who are sceptical about our membership of the European Union need look no further than the amount of funding that the North has got from it.</p><p>For those of us who are pro-Europe, the true European concepts of embracing diversity, respecting difference throughout the European Union and bringing people of different backgrounds together are the important and overriding principles.  However, the net benefit to the North for the period 2007-2013 was in excess of &#163;2&#183;4 billion.  Of that, we received almost &#163;1&#183;3 billion in single farm payments; &#163;330 million through the Northern Ireland rural development fund; &#163;18 million through the European fisheries fund; &#163;180 million through Peace III; over &#163;300 million through the European regional development fund element of the regional competitive and employment objective; &#163;165 million through the European social fund element; and &#163;77 million through INTERREG IV.  That is the amount of investment that others have made in us.</p><p>I hear the Euroscepticism coming from England and the message that we should pull out of Europe and no longer embrace that concept of respect for difference that has kept Europe peaceful and has avoided the potential of two awful world wars happening on a third occasion.  I thank God that people had the foresight to come together and work collaboratively for that aim.  At present, there is a Eurosceptic wing in England that is intent on pulling us away from that concept.  There are others who talk the talk but who are not prepared to walk the walk and vote against austerity and measures that will be of serious detriment to our community and our business sector.  Borders would re-emerge and, indeed, there would be a border within our country, where some 60% of SMEs from the North do business with the rest of the island.  That is what we are face:  Euroscepticism at its worst.  The important thing is to be there to vote against that and to do what we can to represent our communities.</p><p>I will move on to the priorities of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment.  In February, the Committee agreed its 2015 European priorities, including the concept of setting up a European fund for strategic investments through the promotion of cooperation with national promotional banks and improving access to funding for SMEs.  The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment plans to scrutinise and investigate how SMEs from Northern Ireland can avail themselves of a range of measures to improve access to finance.</p><p>The Committee has also decided on a strategic framework for the energy union and will focus on investigating energy supply security, which is a very important issue for our businesses; the integration of national energy markets; a reduction in European energy demand; the decarbonisation of the energy mix; and promoting research and innovation in the energy field.  The Committee will continue to scrutinise the introduction of the integrated single energy market and the Department's renewable energy targets.</p><p>Another Committee priority for 2015 is the internal market strategy for goods and services.  We want a renewed and integrated approach for the single market to deliver further integration and improve mutual recognition and standardisation in key industrial and services sectors where the economic potential is greatest.  In doing that, the Committee will, again, keep a particular focus on SMEs.</p><p>The Committee will also conduct a comprehensive review of the EU's trade policy strategy and, in particular, its contribution to jobs, growth and investment.  It will also review the outcome of negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and how those will impact on the economic strategy of Northern Ireland businesses and inward investment.</p><p>The Committee will spend a lot of time on European priorities during the upcoming year.  In that regard, we rely very heavily on the flow of specialist information from Europe, which could always be improved.  Europe is a vast, wide policy area that has many implications for the North, but, in turn, Northern Ireland gets so much out of membership of the EU.  The Northern Ireland economy has been underpinned by funding support from the EU.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: European Scrutiny Priorities 2015"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>That funding support accounts for 8&#183;4% of our annual GDP.

Thanks very much, Mr Principal Deputy Speaker.  I support the motion, and I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate.</p><p>Women are significantly under-represented in STEM, and the need for more to enter the sector is vital if we are to meet that demand.  Indeed, if we are looking ahead to the future and if corporation tax issues get resolved, it is precisely that demand that will hopefully increasingly be in the local economy.  It is particularly important and relevant that we start preparatory work for that now.  In fact, it should have started long ago.</p><p>In his statement on 4 June, the Minister acknowledged that this is not a new issue, and nor is it a small issue with a quick fix.  We are trying to overcome numerous barriers, which will take time.  In addressing the gender imbalance, we need to initiate and, in some cases, strengthen collaboration between the Government, business and careers guidance in schools.  Indeed, going wider than that, I venture that childcare certainly factors in to it for many families, when many young women especially are considering what career, if any, they should choose to go with.  I also think that it is important that, at this particular moment when we are discussing so much about welfare reform, its true aspect is also looked at, which is to help and support people in their transition from benefits and into meaningful work.  The requirement for improved childcare certainly cannot be ignored, and whenever you are out and about, you find that it is an issue that very frequently comes up with young families.</p><p>We are trying to overcome numerous barriers, which will take time.  Although the motion specifically calls on the Minister for Employment and Learning to act, other Ministers have a role to play.  As my colleague Mr Rogers highlighted, the Education Minister has a role to play to ensure that the seeds are planted early.  We need to ensure that young girls are encouraged to take an interest in STEM subjects and are not led to believe that those subjects are just for boys.  Tackling that misperception and capturing interest early on are key if young women are to keep on the relevant subjects up to A level.</p><p>There is a lot to be said for the importance of careers guidance in schools, especially considering that the age of 16 is the critical point at which women are lost to a potential career.  Imbalance in STEM begins post-GCSE, despite the fact that girls are now more likely than boys to achieve A* to C grades in maths, core and additional science, and in each of the three individual sciences.  Of girls who took GCSE STEM subjects, 76&#183;3% achieved the higher A* to C grades compared with 75&#183;6% of boys.  Despite high achievements in GCSE and A level, it has been reported that females account for only 29&#183;8% of those graduating from higher education in STEM subjects.  More males tend to study STEM subjects, particularly computer science, engineering and technology.</p><p>That indicates that the issue is not a lack of ability and talent but a lack of information, opportunities and the support that is required to help people into those types of work.  Individuals who have STEM qualifications are in demand.  Wearing another hat as Chair of the Enterprise Committee, I can say that, through our inquiry into the opportunities in a lower-tax environment, which we hope will be created through the lowering of corporation tax, the evidence that we have taken already shows that skills, including the acquisition of new skills and improved skills as part of a growing economy, has emerged as a key issue for many employers in the North.</p><p>A  STEM qualification puts a person in a stronger position in a competitive job market.  Studying STEM subjects opens up a wide variety of exciting and rewarding career opportunities.  It can be hard to make the link between what you study in the classroom and the opportunities available in the world of work, and I think that a key element is going out to visit businesses.  Mr Principal Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you have seen that in your previous role.  There has to be a strategic approach between schools and businesses.  The interconnection is sporadic at the moment.  There can be good employers in an area that have no connection with schools.  It is important that that link be formally and strategically developed and established, not just left to the goodwill of a good careers teacher.  It can be hard to make that link, but the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment needs to work with the Minister of Education, the Minister for Employment and Learning, and, of course, Invest NI, to ensure that the STEM subjects that we teach in our schools, colleges and universities equips our young people with the skills that industry looks for in its employees.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.

Despite their decision to parachute candidates into a number of constituencies, with the exception, of course, of Fermanagh and South Tyrone and North Belfast, I am confident that they will have little or no mandate come 8 May.  The cuts that they have imposed on the block grant have obviously had an impact on the ability of Departments to deliver public services to the highest possible standard.  However, it is my view that many of our Ministers have performed heroically in the face of that onslaught by protecting front-line services and the most vulnerable members of society.  We will continue to do that, but the new British Government need to end this ruinous austerity policy.</p><p>It has been quite interesting to listen to a number of interviews that David Cameron, Theresa May and George Osborne have been involved in over the last couple of weeks.  When they are challenged about where the &#163;30 billion of cuts will come from, including &#163;12 billion of cuts that will affect some of the most disadvantaged, vulnerable, disabled and marginalised people in society, they refuse to give an answer.

Amongst those who wish for the status quo with Europe to remain, there is hysteria about the very prospect of a referendum, but, importantly, there has not even been any agreement at this stage on what the referendum question would be.  Given that, at this point in the election, we do not know what will happen on 7 May in any great form, we have to be careful not to allow ourselves to get drawn into an almost hysterical position on what our future relationship with Europe would look like.  That broader discussion will definitely need to happen, but I am not convinced that this is the time to do it.</p><p>That said, I welcome the Member's premise.  It is very telling, and it will not go unnoticed by the electorate, that there are people, even in the Assembly, who are very vocal in their opposition to the so-called Tory cuts, but, when they have the opportunity to make their voices heard in the national Parliament, they refuse to do so and miss that opportunity.  The electorate's patience is growing thin.  I believe that, in this election, the electorate will be looking not only at those who are shouting the loudest but at those who are backing up their words with actions.</p><p>This is a unique opportunity, and the precedent has been set.  The Member for Foyle makes a very good point in that Northern Ireland is within the United Kingdom &#8212; long may that be the case, as far as I am concerned &#8212; but, while that is the case, what excuse do the parties that do not take their seats have, because the precedent has been set in other places?</p><p>If we look at the Israeli Parliament, for example, there is a very strong Israeli Arab representation, and it would be easy for those people to throw their hands in the air and say that they do not agree with the state and what it is doing, so they will absent themselves.  However, what they say is that they can make a difference in the Parliament and can have the voices of their people heard.  They back up their words with actions in the way that they do so.  I struggle to see what the abstentionist parties really feel that they are achieving by taking that stance.</p><p>There are more important issues for us to look at.  What can be achieved by strong Northern Ireland representation in the Mother of Parliaments in Westminster?  From our point of view on this side of the House, we are putting the economy at the very centre of what we want to achieve, and we want to use our influence to ensure that Northern Ireland continues to prosper and to be looked on as a serious contender when it comes to foreign companies investing and creating wealth.  The ability to set our own rate of corporation tax would be a hugely beneficial tool in making that grow even more.  However, there is a huge question mark over whether, in the short to medium term, that will turn out to be the case while there is a continued failure on the part of some parties in the Assembly to face the realities that are being forced on us in relation to welfare reform.</p><p>I recognise that the Member for Foyle made specific mention of our party, and I am glad that even the nationalist parties are recognising that it looks like the DUP will be a strong contender for kingmaker when it comes to the next term.

They have applied for jobs in the Catholic sector, and it is clear that they do not get them because they do not hold this certificate.

The Department that pays for the training of new doctors is the same Department that pays for their employment.  That is not the issue that we have in education.  There is a laissez-faire attitude in the Department of Education.

Admittedly, I came to the Committee a little bit later, before the report had already been started, so I came into it when it was already well under way.  I welcome its publication and many of its findings.  I do so as an open-minded Eurosceptic; I have no difficulty in being described in that way because I am entirely open-minded.  I accept the entire premise as to why the European Union was set up in the first place:  to ensure that Europe would never again find itself at war and, furthermore, encourage greater cooperation between all the states of Europe.  I am entirely in favour of that principle and concept.  However, this is my difficulty:  in my view, the European Union was never set up to meddle with the justice system of an independent jurisdiction, its environmental policy, or how much fishing could be done in the waters around it.  Until those issues are properly dealt with, broad acceptance of the utopia to which Mr McGlone refers is perhaps some way off.  I hope that, in the coming days, there will be a renegotiation of how the powers of Europe impact on us in this part of the United Kingdom.</p><p>To touch on what Mr McGlone says, my interest is particularly around business, how it can do better from engaging with the European Union, and how it can get involved in some of the schemes that are going around at the minute.  There is tremendous potential for businesses in Northern Ireland to benefit incredibly from such collaboration.  We think of schemes such as Horizon 2020, for example, which brings together businesses from all parts of Europe.  To go back to what I said in my opening remarks, such cooperation is what the European Union was founded for, and certainly we would like to see more of it.</p><p>One thing that came out of the sessions that we had, particularly with the Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in Brussels, is that its representatives probably failed to convince some of us that everything that could be done is being done to help businesses in Northern Ireland.  Many of our small and medium-sized enterprises just do not have the numbers, on their own, to pursue a lot of these high-yielding, high-profit schemes.  Therefore, they rely entirely on introductions to other companies, perhaps in other parts of Europe, so that they can collaborate.  The staff of our European office in particular are the ones with the contacts and expertise in this matter.  Unless they help to bring companies together and help our home businesses to deal with the bureaucracy and red tape involved in getting access to funds, we will, unfortunately, always lag behind other parts of the United Kingdom.</p><p>Look at what the Executive office of Scotland is doing:  it is exceptionally good at almost spoon-feeding businesses the information that they need.  Let us face it:  most directors of local companies are getting on with running their businesses; they do not have time to fill in forms and trawl through the endless tenders coming through the European system.  So, I think that the Executive office needs to look at how it can be a little more innovative in dealing with local businesses and helping them to tap into this money.</p><p>Generally speaking, the drawdown of funds is something that Northern Ireland needs to do better, particularly in the coming days.  Negotiations are going on at Executive level on how to deal with welfare reform.  However, if we find ourselves in a position where more Sinn F&#233;in cuts are put upon the Assembly as a result of failure to implement welfare reform, our reliance on Europe will be even greater, particularly for arts and cultural organisations, which will be hit tremendously hard by the budget cuts that will come as a result.  Therefore, stronger, greater engagement with the European Union at that level will be even more important.</p><p>I hope that, in the coming days, as a result of this report, each Department within the Executive here in Northern Ireland will ensure that there are better and closer working relationships with the European Union and that every cent and euro that comes into Northern Ireland is used to benefit the people we represent.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: European Scrutiny Priorities 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>T2.

Around two years ago, the Committee considered the Department of Education's report on the review of employment opportunities for teaching staff, including the assessment of the equality impact of the religious certificate requirement.  Whether the House agrees or disagrees, as the report finds, some non-Catholics clearly view the requirement to possess the certificate of religious education as a bar to employment in the Catholic maintained primary school sector.</p><p class=\"italic\">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Beggs] in the Chair)</p><p>The report suggested that there was no statistical evidence of an adverse impact on employment opportunities for newly qualified non-Catholic teachers.  Nonetheless, the Department suggested that the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) should consider limiting this requirement to designated posts only in the primary and nursery sector.  Some Committee members do not view the certificate as necessarily discriminatory.  They accepted the Department's findings that there is no evidence of material disadvantage for non-Catholic teachers.</p><p>The majority of Committee members highlighted considerable concerns about CCMS's continued insistence that teachers in Catholic maintained primary schools be required to obtain the certificate of religious education.  The majority of members felt that the present arrangements are unfair and represent a significant inequality.  These members felt that the approach of CCMS was particularly unhelpful given the need for flexibility on all sides in the face of primary school area planning.  The majority of members believed that cross-sectoral amalgamations and enhanced sharing between schools can only be hampered by what some have described as this unfair employment practice.</p><p>The Committee heard quite recently from CCMS and the Commission for Catholic Education on shared education.  We were advised that CCMS wishes to enhance access to the certificate.  Other than that, I think that it is fair to say that nothing has changed in the intervening two years on the issue of the certificate.</p><p>Speaking as a Member, I want to widen the debate on this matter.  I will, of course, be supporting the motion.  My party has been calling for the removal of the teacher exemption for many years.  The Minister of Education, of course, should have been included in this motion, and, while OFMDFM has a responsibility in relation to equality, it is the Education Minister who has the responsibility for teacher recruitment.  However, the context of the debate has moved on considerably since this matter was last before the House.  Previously, this was discussed when an earlier incarnation of the Education Bill was before us.  It proposed to create a single employing authority.  Now, we have a new Education Authority, which has an obligation in terms of shared education.  There is the new Lisanelly site, advanced proposals for shared education at the Moy and forthcoming proposals for Brookeborough.  Of course, there is also the Education Committee's inquiry into shared education.</p><p>There is always a danger that we use yesterday's language rather than tomorrow's vision.  The exemption should be removed, but it is only part of the wider issue that needs to be addressed.  Debating a motion on it is great for headlines but does little to solve those other issues.  I am pleased that the Churches in Northern Ireland have been working closely with the Department on proposals that could push shared education forward quite dramatically.  This was outlined to us as part of the shared education inquiry, and I believe that the publication of a circular on this issue is imminent.  My party has been at the forefront of the debate on shared education and creating a more cohesive system.  The proposals are ambitious and are not only an indication of a step forward in education in but a symbol of the progress that is being made in Northern Ireland.  They represent a means by which the entrenched sectorism that has existed for far too long in our society can be diluted and a more coherent system of education developed.</p><p>Joint faith schools should assist in normalising the recruitment of teachers.  The Catholic certificate has always been an irrelevancy when it comes to doing the job.  The current legislative exemption permits its existence.  There would be an understandable outrage if a Protestant certificate were proposed.  As for Mr Lunn's aspiration for a single certificate, in my understanding that is a teacher's PGCE or bachelor of education &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Teacher Employment: Inequality"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>&#8212; degree certificate.

The Committee considered the relevant consultation on 5 November 2014 and the draft rule on 4 February 2015.  The Committee also engaged with the teaching unions, seeking their views on the changes to the Northern Ireland Teachers&#8217; Pension Scheme.  Members accepted that the legislation in question was largely technical in nature and that its passage was certainly required in order to ensure the continued payment of teachers&#8217; pensions.  The Committee noted that the Examiner of Statutory Rules had found no impediments in the drafting of the rule.  The Committee, therefore, agreed on 3 March 2015 that it was content for the Assembly to affirm the rule.</p><p>This secondary legislation is part of the wider reform of teachers&#8217; pensions.  As pensioners&#8217; longevity has improved, so costs have increased.  In order to manage this increasing liability, teachers&#8217; contributions have risen to an average of 9&#183;6% of pensionable salary.  Teachers&#8217; retirement age is also set to change.  It is expected that the average retirement age for teachers will increase from around 60 at present to around 65 in about 10 years&#8217; time.  That will increase again to 66 in about 20 years from now.  As well as teachers&#8217; contributions, employers&#8217; contributions have also increased to 17&#183;7%, generating an additional cost of around &#163;37 million per annum for the next four years.</p><p>The costs are substantial and the changes are significant.  The outlook, according to the actuaries, appears to be better, with employers&#8217; contributions to the new pension scheme falling back to 13&#183;2% in 2019-2020 as contributions catch up with liabilities.  It is also hoped that there will be no further increases in teachers&#8217; contributions to their pensions.  This is a difficult transition with consequences for all teachers and, indeed, further education lecturers that need to be fully understood.</p><p>As I indicated earlier, the Committee was content with the legislation.  However, members did have a number of reservations and concerns.  Firstly, members want to be sure that the Department will make significant efforts to communicate these complex pension changes that will take effect in about two weeks&#8217; time.  Members also wanted to be sure that the Department will properly explain and be flexible in respect of the timescales relating to options for avoiding actuarial reductions.</p><p>As I indicated a moment ago, that may very well affect almost all teachers retiring 20 years from now.</p><p>Finally, changes of the kind proposed in this and related legislation may have equality implications.  The Committee was surprised by the absence of workforce information and equality data for teachers.  The Committee felt that the Department should do more, and soon, to develop and maintain such data.  Members felt that, for a modern teaching profession, it was only sensible to know more detailed demographic profile information for its employees.</p><p>The Department has provided some assurance in respect of the above.  I hope that the Minister, in his response, will touch on these matters again and give reassurance to members of the Committee.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Teachers' Pension Scheme (Consequential Provisions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-10", "body": "<p>Will the Minister give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-10", "body": "<p>Can the Minister give us a timescale for when we will have sight of both regulations and the code of practice?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-10", "body": "<p>10.

A significant number of concerns were identified by stakeholders, and those manifested themselves in a sometimes lively exchange between them and the Department.</p><p>On 18 February, the Department provided an update briefing on what is now the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Bill.  The Committee has received further written clarification from the Department.  Members are looking forward to more extensive departmental briefings after Easter, assuming of course that the Bill proceeds as expected today.</p><p>The Minister has helpfully set out the content of the Bill and referenced the relevant context.  During the debate, we may well hear more about the latter than the former.  I am sure that Members will share a great deal of detail regarding the numbers involved and a lot about the importance of special educational needs provision.  The numbers are quite stark.  The Department&#8217;s most recent figures show an increase in the number of children with special educational needs from around 16% of the school population 10 years ago to 22% now.  Those figures mean, incredibly, that there is a total of 73,000 children with special educational needs, of which about 16,000 have a formal statement.  A recent report also showed that the number of pupils presenting with autism spectrum disorder has increased by 67% in around five years.</p><p>So, what is going on in our schools?  Certainly, some of this increase is down to an improved capacity in schools to identify and correctly route children with SEN.  This improvement is a positive thing.  If the issues that prevent or limit our children's access to the curriculum are caught early and addressed, this is very much to be welcomed.  There have been a number of excellent programmes:  Sure Start, community education initiatives, and the extended schools programme.  It is also worthy of note that all of the above and some SEN budget lines have been cut back in the 2015-16 Department of Education budget.  This is disappointing in the context of what we are dealing with today.  The growth in demand for SEN support services has placed a considerable burden on the budgets of the education and library boards.  The boards have also struggled with the interface with the health and social care trusts, which provide many of the supporting services.  The Committee has previously taken evidence about the unsatisfactory relationship between Health and Education and will do more work on this in the coming weeks.</p><p>At one time or another, most MLAs will have been contacted by constituents with problems relating to obtaining a statement of special educational needs for a child, the content of such a statement, or the nature of the SEN provision.  It is self-evident that the statementing process is complex, confusing, overly bureaucratic and, therefore, ripe for reform, as referred to by the Minister.  Ideally, that reform will lead to a welcome reduction in some statementing timescales.  However, I note that the Bill before us only reduces the timescales for parents' participation in the statement assessment process.  I understand that other changes will be made in secondary legislation affecting the Education Authority, the overall idea being to simplify and speed up the whole process.  These aspects of the Bill and the other anticipated changes to secondary legislation, which I understand are to deal with statementing, appear to be well-intentioned, though, in the absence of the necessary detail, it is not completely clear.</p><p>As well as statementing and changing the role, qualifications and title of the special educational needs coordinator (SENCO), the Bill intends to do a number of other things.  In line with international accords and new legislation in other jurisdictions, the Bill will require relevant authorities to have regard to the views of the child in respect of SEN provision.  There is also a requirement to undertake a pilot project to allow for appeals and claims by children below compulsory school age.  Additionally, children and young people above compulsory school age will acquire rights that previously resided with their parents or carers.</p><p>The majority of Committee members may well wonder about the value of much of this.  Obviously, we all want children to get the best start in life through a good education.  I am not sure, however, that these proposals will significantly change that.  I suspect that they might entertain lawyers and, more worryingly, add to the general Department of Education bureaucracy.  I understand that a similar pilot scheme has been completed in another jurisdiction and that almost identical legislation has been passed elsewhere.  That being the case, I anticipate that the Committee may well feel that the Department should simply study the results in those other places and seriously evaluate whether these pilot schemes provisions are actually necessary at this time.</p><p>The Bill also places obligations on boards of governors and on the Education Authority in respect of special educational needs.  I am a member of a number of boards of governors, and I declare an interest at this time in respect of my membership on the boards of governors of Castle Gardens Primary School in Newtownards, Killinchy Primary School and Nendrum College in Comber.  My experience and, I am sure, that of other school governors in the Chamber, is that obligations on schools and even the education and library boards are all very well.  However, to make a difference, appropriate support and guidance will be required for SENCOs, teachers and school leaders.  Statutory agreements between the Education Authority and the health and social care trusts will also be needed.</p><p>The Committee welcomes the work that has done in improving teachers&#8217; SEN capacity.  It has also noted the ongoing reviews of the multidisciplinary support teams and the allied health professionals.  Members look forward to a standardised regional SEN support service, which will give more certainty to parents and children on the help that they can expect to receive.</p><p>The Bill also proposes changes to the appeals mechanism for SEN.  In particular, an independent mediation service has been proposed, and I expect that the Committee may take the view that the intervention of a trusted and informed third party may prove to be a boon to would-be appellants and might help them to resolve disagreements more efficiently and effectively.  The Committee will, of course, wish to study the detail and, in particular, the relevant regulation-making powers that the Department seeks.</p><p>I have mentioned the lack of clarity and the absence of the anticipated secondary legislation a number of times.  While the debate is about the principles of the SEND Bill, it is timely to reference the balance between the primary legislation that is before us, the anticipated secondary legislation, and the consequent impact on the statutory SEN code of practice that the House might not see until the next mandate.  It is difficult for us to debate the principles of the Bill when its impact cannot be fully set out and cannot yet be fully understood.  It will be even more difficult to put the Bill through its amending stages without that clarity.</p><p>The Committee may also struggle to accept the very wide-ranging regulation-making powers that the Department is seeking in the Bill.  It is hoped that, during the anticipated Committee Stage, the Department will fully disclose all the planned ramifications for statementing and all the other parts of the SEN framework.  As Chair of the Committee, I am concerned about the absence of clarity and the balance of the Bill.  I would like to hear reassurance from the Minister that my concerns and those of stakeholders will not simply be brushed aside.</p><p>I would now like to add a few words as my party&#8217;s spokesperson on education.  A major problem hangs over the Bill, and I am concerned about the absence of detail in the absence of the secondary legislation that will flow from it.  The Chamber is being asked to take a leap in the dark.  That is an unsatisfactory situation, and while I support the general principle of the Bill, in that I recognise the real need for the reform of SEN in Northern Ireland, I will need clear direction form the Department about what will come next.  It will be no good if the Bill merely moves the deckchairs on the Titanic.  Its purpose and outcome must be to address the needs of children.</p><p>The number of children who need assistance is increasing; the Department's statistics are a clear indication of that fact.  That may be down to good work in identifying and diagnosing, but we must assume that the Bill is about moving forward and improving the provision for children with special educational needs.  In saying that, we are seeing cuts to the very bodies that identify and remediate those needs and the Department is not creating a supportive environment.  We can pass all the legislation we want, but unless adequate funding is in place for the purposes of diagnosing, supporting and addressing those needs, it will seem that we are merely shuffling those proverbial deckchairs.</p><p>The weighty, over-bureaucratic and lengthy statementing process is ripe for reform, but the question that must be asked and fully investigated is how the Bill proposes to sort out that problem.  It is difficult to make an assessment of that from the Bill and, while there is a proposed reduction in the waiting period from 29 days to 22 days, following the decision of the board to undertake a statutory assessment, it appears rather arbitrary simply to reduce it by seven days.  Why not reduce it to 14, seven or no days?  That period is to allow parents to make representations about whether or not they are content for an assessment to take place, but it is a concern where parents are not willing to engage when the child has a clear need.  A reduction of seven days merely tinkers around the edges when one considers that the average length of time for the assessment of a child is six months.  As the Bill moves into Committee Stage, that period will have to be looked at carefully, particularly in the context of placing the needs of the child first.  Is there more that could be done to streamline the process to ensure that the child is receiving the assistance and support that he or she needs more quickly?</p><p>One of the major problems to date has been levels of inconsistency in policy across the five boards.  Hopefully, that will be eradicated as a result of the creation of the Education Authority.  That pre-existing inconsistency caused greater confusion and, in some cases, higher expectancy.  The movement towards consistency will undoubtedly encounter similar difficulties.</p><p>The Bill brings into legislation rights for children and young people that previously rested with their parents or carers.  It is important, however, that those rights are balanced against those of teachers, carers and parents.  It is even more important that those rights do not detract from addressing the paramount needs of the child.</p><p>In conclusion, to continue the Titanic theme, at present this appears to be iceberg legislation.  The majority of it, which is yet unseen, is contained in the forthcoming secondary legislation.  The potential dangers of what lies hidden are of the greatest concern, and I ask the Minister and the Department to provide the clarity needed as we go into the Committee Stage of the Bill.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-09", "body": "<p>T2.

This has been a very useful debate on the Committee's report.  I thank Members and the Minister for their contributions.  As I indicated at the outset of the debate, the reality of life is that people do get sick and can need to take time off work at some stage in their working career.</p><p>John McCallister made a couple of important points.  One thing that he said was that work is good for people's health.  I think the vast majority of people do enjoy their work and get a lot from it.  At some stage in employees' careers they come across situations that put them off work.  Sometimes a lot of the problems are down to management, how those issues are handled and whether the issue becomes protracted and considerably worse over time.  We have to learn how to nip those issues in the bud for the sake of the employees and also to get value for money, as the Minister said, from employees, because employees want to be productive.  They want to get their work/life balance correct, and all that they want is assistance in doing that.</p><p>Of course, I welcome the introduction of mental health first aid and the availability of that for staff, because I think it is an issue.  Perhaps staff do want to help their employees and help those that they have line-management responsibility for, but it is about ensuring that they know what to do and how to spot certain signs, especially in regard to employees' mental health.</p><p>The Committee's report has outlined how that reality can be dealt with to minimise, manage and reduce absence levels.  There is undoubtedly scope for improvement through the public sector that could result, as we said, in savings of approximately &#163;37 million a year to the public purse.  Of course, Mr Nesbitt pointed out that a 1% increase in productivity could lead to savings of &#163;64 million.</p><p>The figures, as referred to during the debate, show that the average level of sickness absence in the public sector here compares quite unfavourably to that in England, Scotland and Wales.  While the figures may vary according to the different parts of the public sector, a rough indicator is that the level of sickness absence in the Civil Service in Britain is about 7&#183;5 average working days lost per staff year, compared with slightly over 10 days in the Civil Service here.</p><p>We have heard that the health and wider education sectors need to improve the monitoring and reporting of sickness absence and to set and adhere to challenging and realistic targets.  In the health sector, the focus continues to be on long-term absence, particularly related to mental health and musculoskeletal problems.  Members are pleased, therefore, to see specific programmes targeting these issues, such as rapid referral to physiotherapy services in the case of the latter.</p><p>It has been emphasised that such early intervention schemes need to be replicated across not only the health sector but the entire public sector.  In the education sector, stress-related absence in the teaching profession needs to be addressed.  This includes, amongst other things, evaluating the health and well-being programmes and training in this area in an effort to increase early intervention and decrease the human and financial cost of teacher absence and, of course, the cost to children.</p><p>In relation to the performance of the Civil Service, it is clear that there are a number of well-established procedures and programmes in place to assist staff and that absence is taken seriously.  However, as noted earlier, the forthcoming public sector reforms &#8212; in particular, the loss of a large number of staff under the voluntary exit scheme &#8212; could have an impact on the staff who remain in post.  As changes take effect and workloads increase, so, too, may the need for support services such as Carecall and the welfare support service.</p><p>Reference has been made to the difference between sick absence rates in the public sector and the private sector.  The Committee commissioned research into this issue.  From the research findings, members noted that comparisons between the public and private sectors can prove difficult.  Levels of absence may appear lower in the private sector, but we need to be very careful about making straight comparisons due to a lack of data on absence levels in that sector.  The private sector also covers different types of jobs, and there are differences in the gender breakdown of its workforce, a point that was also raised by Members today.</p><p>While the Committee was encouraged to note that the research suggests that more robust reporting mechanisms for sick absence exist in the public sector, I urge caution in making straight comparisons due to the differences outlined.  Similarly, direct comparisons between sick absence levels in different Departments and areas of the public sector can be problematic due to the different job profiles and working patterns of their staff.  The Committee has, therefore, based its analysis on comparing performance of public sector bodies here with their equivalents in Britain.</p><p>The Committee is convinced of the value of benchmarking and learning from the successes of other comparable organisations in other places.  This is highlighted by the example of HMRC, which is referenced in the Committee's report.  It successfully reduced its absence rate from 10&#183;5 days in 2010 to 7&#183;51 days in 2013 by introducing a robust assurance programme.  This raises the prospect of what the Civil Service here could achieve from a more concerted effort to apply consistently the procedures and policies that are already in place:  in other words, better compliance with performance management and absence management policies.</p><p>Given the persistent themes around long-term absence and mental health issues, it is clear that resources must be focused on addressing the underlying causes and implications, taking the health and well-being of staff to the very heart of organisations whilst being clear that each Department will have different circumstances with regard to the reasons for absence and related needs.  Members have rightly highlighted the fact that long-term absence needs a particular focus.  As the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Michaela Boyle, highlighted, 70% of days lost are due to long-term absence.  As has been said, that needs to be a priority for Departments and the Executive.</p><p>Publication of the sickness absence recovery strategy, the roll-out of the mental health first-aid training programme, cognitive behavioural therapy, tailored and targeted training, and adequate policies that are supported by management to deal with bullying and harassment have all been identified as important measures in going forward.  It has also been pointed out that there could be value in researching the reasons why mental health-related issues continue to be such a significant causation factor behind absence rates in the local public sector.</p><p>Also, as indicated by a number of Members, there must be effective monitoring and reporting systems in place consistently across all Departments.  Awareness needs to be raised of how a simple measure, such as a return-to-work interview, can be used to encourage individuals returning to work to be open and candid about any problems which may affect their attendance or ability in work.  The evidence shows that, at the heart of these measures and at all stages, the importance of staff engagement should not be underestimated.</p><p>We heard from Peter Weir, Leslie Cree and others how the WELL programme, cycle to work schemes, the Caloriewise scheme and adoption of early intervention policies are all ways in which the Civil Service can be more proactive.  The value of giving employees the option to work flexibly, particularly in terms of work location, has been proven to reduce sick absence and encourage people to return to work more quickly.  It has been emphasised that this option should be progressed in a strategic and coordinated manner.  It is fair to say that, in the Committee, Mr Girvan was a wee bit sceptical about flexible location working, but I have to agree with the Member that mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure that work is done and that Members and employers in the public sector can have confidence that flexible location working can work.</p><p>In conclusion, I emphasise that we are talking about a significant amount of money.  There is a potential saving of &#163;37 million per year to the public purse through simply matching the comparable public sector sickness absence levels in Britain.  That is a staggering figure, particularly given the financial squeeze on the public sector and public purse.  The Committee's recommendations could have a significant impact on achieving those savings and we expect the Department to study the report very carefully.  The Committee looks forward to receiving a formal response to the report after the Department has reflected further on the evidence and the recommendations therein.  I therefore commend the report to the House and ask for support for the Committee's motion.</p><p class=\"italic\">Question put and agreed to.\n\nResolved:</p><p class=\"italic\">That this Assembly approves the report of the Committee for Finance and Personnel on its review of sickness absence in the Northern Ireland public sector; and calls on the Minister of Finance and Personnel, in conjunction with Executive colleagues, to implement, as applicable, the recommendations contained therein.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Sickness Absence in the Northern Ireland Public Sector"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  I beg to move</p><p class=\"italic\">That this Assembly approves the report of the Committee for Finance and Personnel on its review of sickness absence in the Northern Ireland public sector; and calls on the Minister of Finance and Personnel, in conjunction with Executive colleagues, to implement, as applicable, the recommendations contained therein.</p><p>I find myself once again speaking about a report by the Committee for Finance and Personnel that identifies huge potential savings for the public purse at a time when we as a government face significant budgetary pressures and the restructuring of our public sector.  The Committee's cross-cutting review of sickness absence in the local public sector has identified potential savings of approximately &#163;37 million a year for the public purse if average sickness absence rates in our Civil Service, health trusts and the education sector are brought into line with those of their equivalents in England, Scotland and Wales.</p><p>Before I outline the Committee's key findings and recommendations, let me explain the background to the work.  The review arose from a referral by the Public Accounts Committee of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in 2013 on sickness absence in the local public sector.</p><p>The 2013 report provided an initial evidence base on performance against targets for reducing sickness absence in the Civil Service, health trusts and the education sector here, compared with equivalent bodies in Britain.  The Finance Committee built upon this through coordinated scrutiny of existing policy implementation to identify good practice and procedures as well as potential areas for improvement.  Evidence was received from the Audit Office, DFP and the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, as well as from the other Assembly Statutory Committees in relation to their respective Departments.  The Committee also received evidence directly from the health sector, commissioned research on various issues and took account of up-to-date statistical data.</p><p>In contextualising the findings, we first have to recognise and accept that people do and will get sick.  I also wish to highlight that the Committee's work identified a lot of positives, including the fact that there has been progress in developing and introducing good practice policies and monitoring systems.  Some individual business areas have been very successful in reducing absence rates.  The statistics show that a majority of civil servants have no recorded sickness absence throughout the year and also that senior managers now appear to be giving greater priority to compliance monitoring.  However, whilst the total cost of sickness absence in these areas of the local public sector amounts to around &#163;150 million per year, it has to be stressed that the potential savings of &#163;37 million per year are on the basis of simply matching the performance of comparable bodies across the water.  The figures that were provided by the Audit Office are stark, and the conclusion cannot be ignored.  More needs to be done, and the Committee's recommendations will assist in this regard.</p><p>On the key statistics, while there seemed to be a downward trend in absence figures in the Civil Service up until 2012, when they levelled out, there has been a consistent failure to meet the overall targets.  For example, in 2013-14, the actual average number of days per staff lost due to sickness absence in the Civil Service was 10&#183;1 set against a target of nine.</p><p>The sense that emerges from the Committee's investigations is that the key reason for the failure to achieve overall targets is because good practice policies have not been applied robustly and consistently enough within and across all Departments, health trusts and the education sector.  However, some hopeful signs appear to be emerging in this regard.</p><p>I take the Department of Finance and Personnel as a case in point.  While the Department as a whole has been unable to meet targets set for absence levels, we have noted some potential success stories from the Committee's scrutiny of performance at a business area level.  For example, the corporate services division indicated that the departmental target may soon be met, thanks to a new partnership approach to absence management between HR partner teams and line managers, and an e-learning training programme.  The Committee looks forward to seeing the fruits of this very soon and for lessons learned to be applied across the entire Civil Service should it prove successful.</p><p>Similarly, in the health sector, in noting the previous limitations of the monitoring systems, members were encouraged to learn that the new HR payroll, travel and subsistence reporting system was being rolled out in an effort to address the poor monitoring and reporting of sick absence, as well as a mixed performance by health trusts in meeting targets.  The new system, once fully established, will also assist with target setting.</p><p>The Committee would also like to see further benchmarking with comparator health bodies in other jurisdictions where possible, taking into account the different job profiles and health-care structures across different organisations.  In catching up with other parts of the public sector, the Committee would also like to see health trusts publishing details of their performance against sickness absence targets going forward.</p><p>In respect of the education sector and the other Civil Service Departments, I am sure that the various Committee representatives will wish to outline their respective findings during this debate.  Suffice it to say at this point that a number of similar issues and themes emerged across the Departments, although it is important to note that different staffing profiles and job roles can impact on general comparisons being made across those different sectors.</p><p>I now turn briefly to what is, undoubtedly, the nub issue &#8212; the impact of long-term absence, especially due to mental ill health.  That has been identified as an area for particular attention, with nearly 30% of working days lost due to sickness absence being attributed to anxiety, stress, depression and other such conditions.  While we might expect that some public-sector roles, such as paramedics, firefighters and social security advisers, are more stressful than others, the reasons why mental ill health is such a significant cause of absence needs to be thoroughly researched to identify and tailor solutions at a local level.  For its part, the Committee has highlighted preventative measures, early intervention and health and well-being programmes that have rolled out across the public sector and which could assist in driving down absence in that regard.</p><p>The Committee has noted how certain health and well-being initiatives, including the WELL programme, Carecall and welfare support, are having an effect.  Members also look forward to seeing the results of the sickness absence recording tool, which could accelerate support to those experiencing work-related stress, which surely will be a focus, given the forthcoming voluntary exit scheme and public-sector restructuring.  Indeed, the Committee has identified a risk that sickness absence could rise without sufficient support for staff who remain in post after significant numbers leave through the forthcoming voluntary exit schemes.</p><p>In terms of further areas for progress, there is a need for increased focus on preventative and early intervention measures.  That includes a roll-out in the consistent application of innovative and proven initiatives such as the mental health first aid programme and cognitive behavioural therapy.  Clearly, mental ill health is the area that efforts should be focused on, as previous programmes in that regard do not seem to have had the desired impact on the figures.  I, therefore, look forward to hearing the Minister respond on that point, including his comments on any additional or new approaches.</p><p>Another preventative area that I am keen to see advanced relates to health and well-being initiatives, such as the Cycle to Work and Caloriewise schemes.  I firmly believe that those will yield benefits in the longer term, but only if a strategic and joined-up approach is taken.</p><p>Similarly, the Committee highlighted evidence on how flexible working can improve work/life balance, generally, and, in particular, on how flexible location working, utilising technology, can assist in enabling the earlier return to work for some people who are on long-term sick leave.</p><p>I conclude by pointing out that the Committee has recommended a number of practical actions that need to be taken to restore the downward trend in sickness absence rates in the local public sector.  They include the roll-out of pilot health and well-being programmes, which have demonstrated the potential to contribute to reducing absence rates; proactive employee engagement on further measures in that regard; the systematic adoption of early intervention measures; more use of flexible location working; continued focus on compliance with procedures and monitoring performance; the application of lessons from the public and private sectors across all Departments; and the regular evaluation of sickness absence policies and programmes against developing good practice.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members and commend the report to the House.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Sickness Absence in the Northern Ireland Public Sector"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.

The purpose of this rule is to extend the current rates exemption for any ATM that is assessed separately for rating purposes in a designated rural area from 31 March 2015 to 1 April 2016.  ATMs that are located in banks or building societies tend to be valued as part of the property and are therefore not affected.</p><p>The exemption initially came into effect in 2007, and policy evaluations carried out in 2009 and 2012 showed increases in the number of rural ATMs.  The Committee noted that, at present, Land and Property Services (LPS) has estimated that around 60 ATMs are covered by the scheme.  The Department has estimated that the cost of the scheme in 2014-15 is just over &#163;130,000, with an estimated cost of around &#163;2,200 per ATM.</p><p>At its meeting on 14 January, the Committee considered the proposal to make the order.  During that consideration, several points were raised about which designation of rural areas was being used for the scheme, who exactly assessed which of the machines was stand-alone or part of a building and who exactly would receive the exemption.  The Committee was advised that NISRA provided the designation of rural areas, that the professional valuation officers from LPS assessed each ATM and decided whether it fell into the scheme's remit, and that the exemption would go to the individuals or group responsible for the stand-alone ATM.</p><p>On a minor technical point that I noted subsequent to the Committee receiving its briefing, perhaps the Minister could clarify why the rule provides for an extension to 1 April 2016, rather than 31 March, as has been the case in previous years.</p><p>The Committee was nonetheless satisfied with the Department&#8217;s answers to its queries and had no objection to the policy proposals at that time.

By this stage in the passage of the Budget Bill 2015, Members will be well aware of its purpose and provisions.  It provides the statutory authority for expenditure in 2014-15 as specified in the spring Supplementary Estimates, encompassing the year&#8217;s monitoring rounds.  The Bill also includes the Vote on Account, which allows public expenditure to continue in the early part of the next financial year until the Assembly votes on the Main Estimates for 2015-16 in early June.</p><p>I do not intend to rehearse the Committee&#8217;s contribution to the debate on the Supply resolutions, as that was the appropriate time to debate the detail of the provisions in the Supplementary Estimates.</p><p>As the Finance Committee recognised previously and in plenary debates over recent weeks, the legislative stages for the existing Budget and financial processes are cumbersome and in need of reform.  Contributions to the recent debates have, in my mind, affirmed that there is broad acceptance across all parties that an overhaul of existing processes should be undertaken.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's comments during last week's Second Stage debate, when he indicated his willingness for work to resume on the memorandum of understanding on the Budget process.  At its meeting last week, the Committee agreed that I should write to the Minister to request that that happens quickly to put in place improved arrangements for the next Budget process so that it meets the needs of the Executive and the Assembly.  Where the latter is concerned, that would include changes to front-load Committees' input so that their scrutiny and advice is provided at the formative stage of the Budget-setting process and before the Executive have agreed the draft Budget.  During 2015-16, we will be faced with the commencement of another Budget process, so we must not delay that work.</p><p>As I outlined previously, the Committee took evidence on the Bill from DFP officials in early February.  That marked the culmination of a process of scrutiny of the 2014-15 in-year monitoring rounds at a strategic and departmental level.  On the basis of that engagement process, the Committee determined that it was content to grant accelerated passage under Standing Order 42(2).  The Committee therefore welcomes the engagement with DFP during the quarterly monitoring rounds and on the Estimates and the Bill.  It was particularly helpful for members to receive clarification on the details of the in-year technical changes to Departments' resource and capital allocations, some of which were quite significant.</p><p>Where the residual issues to be addressed in the weeks ahead are concerned, the Committee reiterates the importance of Departments' minimising any year-end underspend to ensure that the Executive keep within the limits of the Budget exchange scheme, which was agreed with the Treasury.  I expect that all the Statutory Committees will closely monitor their respective Departments' forecasting and expenditure during the remainder of this financial year and, indeed, over the next financial year.</p><p>Given that the Bill makes partial provision for 2015-16, I shall take a few moments to reiterate some of the Committee&#8217;s key conclusions on and recommendations for the next financial year and beyond.  The Committee identified various strategic issues that will need to be addressed sooner rather than later.  Those include careful management of the voluntary exit scheme to minimise risk to public-service delivery, and the Committee will continue its scrutiny of that at its meeting tomorrow.  The Executive will need to take a corporate approach to controlling and bearing down on administrative expenditure across Departments.  The Committee was concerned to note how this has increased in various Departments over recent years.  There will need to be greater focus on preventative spending, and I am interested to note that this is an area being considered within the terms of reference for an ongoing OECD review.  A coordinated approach to promoting the uptake of financial transactions capital will also be needed.</p><p>The Committee has also called for a fully informed and mature public debate on how best to help to meet the further budgetary challenges ahead, based on complete information and analysis of all options for raising additional revenue through charges and further devolved taxes and duties.</p><p>The Committee has called for measures to compensate for the fundamental weakness in our system of budgetary control and oversight, which came about when DFP&#8217;s role changed following devolution from one of challenge to one of pure coordination.  Noting the particular governmental structures in the North, the Committee has highlighted the need for a robust external advisory and challenge function to be exercised within and across all Departments in respect of budgetary savings and efficiencies.  Specific recommendations have been made, which would be distinctive from, but complement, the role of existing oversight bodies, including the Assembly.</p><p>Finally, in facilitating the role of the Assembly, full and timely engagement by Departments with their respective Committee will be crucial in ensuring that all Statutory Committees can fulfil their important advisory and scrutiny functions in the implementation of the 2015-16 Budget provisions.  In turn, I believe that the Committee functions are exercised most effectively when they provide constructive input that adds value to the Budget considerations.</p><p>This evening, on behalf of the Committee, I support the motion.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Budget Bill: Final Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>I beg to move</p><p class=\"italic\">That this Assembly recognises that the persistent reductions to the block grant create significant challenges for the Executive in the delivery of front-line services; welcomes agreement on the Budget 2015-16; further recognises that the Executive have additional revenue-generating powers, which have not been explored fully as part of the Budget process; and calls on the Executive to collectively identify progressive options to raise local revenue and increase the local Budget.</p><p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  As Members are aware, the Executive have come through a period of budgetary challenge and that challenge looks set to continue in the time ahead.  To have no control over our economic destiny ensures that we are seemingly reliant on getting scraps from the table of Westminster again and again.  We are blind to our economic statistics and, to some extent, to our own economic outputs as well.  Fiscal balance reports are accepted without question, and there is no total economic vision of how we could do things differently or better by ourselves.  We need to see greater economic growth.  Economic rule from Westminster has stymied, not enhanced, economic growth, and it is in that context that we need to ensure that we get the best deal &#8212; a fair deal &#8212; on corporation tax.  Tax effects that should benefit our public finances being siphoned off to Westminster is not a fair situation, especially given the recent developments in Scotland relating to the Smith commission.  We should benefit from all changes in local policy.</p><p>We need fiscal levers to improve our tourism sector, manufacturing and inward investment.  We also have to raise revenues, consider progressive taxation and be innovative in how we do that, if it helps to change people's behaviour in public health and well-being.  We are all aware of the massive challenges ahead of us in health and health expenditure.</p><p>The carrier bag levy helped to reduce bag usage by over 200 million in its first year &#8212; 2013-14 &#8212; and generated net proceeds of over &#163;4 million, which have been invested in community and environmental projects through the challenge fund.  The levy demonstrates how a levy or taxation, whatever way you want to describe it, can be used not only to deliver a sea change in public behaviour and but to deliver real financial support to community groups and others working on the ground to educate, maintain and improve health and well-being.</p><p>Elsewhere, there is the Scottish health levy and the community infrastructure levy in England and Wales.  I am not endorsing them but flagging them up as examples of some of the range of options that other Administrations have in taxation.  Collectively, we need to consider what new levies we can administer that will enhance our local budgets and be built on the premise that those who can pay should pay.  The onus is on us, within the context of our local budgetary restraints, to ensure that no one is asked to pay more than they can legitimately afford.  Raising the maximum capital rates value, for example, would ensure that some of the more well off gave a greater contribution to society.  We wish the upper limit on domestic rates to be removed so that a person with a &#163;400,000 house, a &#163;500,000 house or a &#163;600,000 house will pay according to the value of that property.  This will raise close to &#163;7 million and address the inequality in the system.  It is only fair that occupiers pay according to the value of their home, especially those who live in a humble abode valued at &#163;0&#183;5 million or &#163;1 million.  That inequality needs addressed.</p><p>If we had full economic power, we would, in the context of an economic setback or continued economic decline, arrange a compensating public expenditure stimulus to buoy up the economy.  In fact, the stability of the North's public services has been key to protecting the Northern economy from further slippage.  In the absence of economic power, we need to consider other options.  One is to ensure that the North can fully benefit from the European Investment Bank.  We believe that the Executive should establish an outside body to draw down loans from the European Investment Bank to fund major infrastructure projects.</p><p>In Scotland, the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) has led on a diverse portfolio of projects across the country, which helps to attract more than &#163;4 billion of additional investment over and above traditional capital budgets.  We need to maximise all the funding avenues that we can to try to bring forward projects that would otherwise remain in the pipeline for years to come.  Over five years, from 2009-2010 to 2013-14, the SFT in Scotland has brought cumulative savings and benefits of over &#163;640 million.  That is a proposal worth exploring at Executive level.  I think that the Finance Minister should look at it in how we can move the economy forward and how we can generate more support for infrastructure projects over and above the traditional approach to such matters.</p><p>Our levels of poverty, as they stand, will not lead to economic growth, but eradicating low pay will lift people out of poverty and help us to build a more sustainable economy.  People want to work, people want to participate in society, and people are better able to participate in the economy from a base of individual security.  This is crucial, and it is crucial that our people are paid a living wage.  Paying the living wage to workers is not just an aspirational goal, as some would say.  We believe that, at the formation of the next Executive, the Programme for Government should include a commitment to delivering the living wage in the public sector.  We believe that we should have the power to decide the same for the private sector.  At the moment, the living wage is &#163;7&#183;65 an hour.  Remember that this is the rate to ensure that workers have a basic &#8212; a basic &#8212; standard of living.  It is not too much to ask.</p><p>In the North, about 170,000 workers, such as sales assistants, care assistants, hairdressers, bar staff etc, earn less than &#163;7&#183;65 an hour.  More than 80% of our 18-to 21-year-olds earn less than the living wage, so there is a huge disparity between young and old.  I believe that our young people are worth much, much more than that and should be treated fairly.  Paying workers a better wage, a basic living wage, will increase productivity, which is better for their employer and better for them.  It would also boost spending in the economy by some &#163;124 million a year, according to Oxford Economics, and give the Exchequer a net gain of &#163;83 million through increased tax receipts and reduced benefit payments.  Belfast City Council has already ensured that all of its employees receive the living wage, and we should follow its example.  Derry and Strabane District Council has followed suit.  A living wage is not just aspirational.</p><p>Of course, we have been here before.  There was the debate many years ago about a minimum wage, and it was said that it was too much to ask for.  When it was introduced, the economy, the private sector and the public sector soon adjusted because it was the bare minimum.  Now, we need to ensure that people have a basic income to ensure a basic standard of living, and, by introducing the living wage, we would introduce more money into the economy.</p><p>It would boost spending as well, and that is something that we need to do.</p><p>To conclude, we brought the motion to the Chamber today not only to put forward some of our ideas and proposals for moving the economy forward but to kick-start debate.  We need to have more constructive debate on the economy and fiscal levers.  We will have different views on issues such as corporation tax and air passenger duty &#8212; issues that we may have flogged to death on the Finance Committee &#8212; but I believe that, since the previous mandate, we have moved on to some interesting ground.  At the moment, the Finance Committee is considering the effects of the Barnett formula and its future.  The Assembly and the Executive need to push forward economic proposals and be innovative.  I gave one example, which was that of the carrier bag levy.  We can do much more than that.  There is a train coming down the track, and that is the projected costs of the health service for the Executive.  We need to meet that head-on, and we need to introduce innovative proposals, not only to raise revenue but to try to change people's behaviours when it comes to obesity and diabetes.</p><p>I hope that we can have a worthwhile debate.  I look forward to the amendments being proposed by the Alliance Party and the DUP, and I look forward to the debate.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant: Reductions"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  As the Minister has outlined, the Public Service (Civil Servants and Others) Pensions (Consequential Provisions) Regulations (NI) 2015 make consequential provision in relation to the new Civil Service pension scheme under the Public Service Pensions Act (NI) 2014.  This regulation supersedes the Public Service (Civil Servants and Others) Pensions (Consequential and Amendment) Regulations (NI) 2015 &#8212; that is a mouthful &#8212; that was made incorrectly.  The regulations modify the effect of other statutory provisions in their application to the Civil Service pension scheme.  These amendments are necessary to ensure that the new alpha pension scheme operates as intended within the wider framework of pensions and tax legislation.</p><p>The Committee noted, in particular, that there are two changes required, which will be made by draft affirmative resolution:  transitional provisions to stop transitional members being treated as deferred members of their pre-2015 scheme; and consequential modifications to the tax regime in respect of ill-health benefits.  Transitional members who take ill-health retirement will be protected from being assessed against tax twice as a consequence of their having non-accruing membership of the old scheme in addition to membership in the 2015 scheme.</p><p>The policy proposals contained in the rule were formally considered by the Finance and Personnel Committee on 21 January.  After consideration, the Committee confirmed that it had no comment to make on the policy proposals at that stage.  Members also noted that DFP conducted a four-week consultation exercise on the draft regulations, and that ended on 19 December.  The Department advised that the shortened four-week consultation process with trades unions only was because the regulations and the Act were already subject to a full public consultation.  Moreover, members were advised that trade union side did not have any objections and had indicated that it would not be submitting a formal response.</p><p>The Committee formally considered the statutory rule before the Assembly today at its meeting on 4 February, together with the accompanying report from the Assembly&#8217;s Examiner of Statutory Rules.  The rule was laid before the Assembly on Friday 23 January subject to draft affirmative resolution procedure.</p><p>While the Examiner raised no issues by way of technical scrutiny in relation to the rule before us, he had previously advised the Department on Monday 26 January that, as an earlier version of the rule purported to have been made subject to affirmative resolution, it would have no effect since it should have been laid in draft before making.  The Department subsequently replaced the rule accordingly with the one being considered today.</p><p>That was noted by the Committee as part of its scrutiny, and the Committee therefore agreed to recommend that the Public Service (Civil Servants and Others) Pensions (Consequential Provisions) Regulations (NI) 2015 be affirmed by the Assembly.  Therefore, on behalf of the Finance and Personnel Committee, I support the motion.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Public Service (Civil Servants and Others) Pensions (Consequential Provisions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015"}, {"date": "2015-02-17", "body": "<p>We need to find the most effective way of doing so.  There has been much discussion today of environmental zones as opposed to limits.  Ideally, we want 20 mph zones to ensure that you do not have people speeding through the area regardless of the speed limit, as the Member for East Antrim argued earlier.  But the fact of the matter is that the limit itself does deter people from going over it; it is as simple as that.  There will always be people who break the limits regardless of what it is, but setting the limit in law will affect people's behaviour, particularly drivers' behaviour.</p><p>The Minister talked of bringing about a cycling revolution.  The revolution is not here yet, but this will certainly help it on its way.  Making our roads significantly safer will make it safer for people, especially children, to cycle.  At the moment, roads and streets are far from safe and, in some cases, getting less so.  Rolling out the 20 mph speed limits on streets where people live is a key part of the cycling revolution to which he refers.</p><p>The potential health benefits are huge as well.  Recent analysis of cycle deaths in London found that virtually all fatal collisions occurred on roads with a speed limit of 30 mph or higher.  Research in London also found that, of pedestrians hit at 40 mph, 90% are killed; of pedestrians hit at 30 mph, 20% are killed; and of pedestrians hit at 20 mph, 3% are killed.  Therefore, reducing the speed limit and drivers' speeds towards 20 mph reduces the chances of people being killed on our roads by a huge margin.</p><p>The cost of road signage should be weighed up against the many benefits of 20 mph limits, which include boosting walking and cycling, in particular, but also related health and environmental benefits and the reduction in roads casualties.  Streets with 20 mph limits have 40% fewer road casualties and the greatest reduction in numbers of young children killed and injured.  Default 20 mph limits are also cheaper to implement and can reduce the need to spend on significant new infrastructure.  The benefits of 20 mph limits reach far beyond road safety to increased social interaction and physical activity, along with improved air quality and noise levels.</p><p>Sustrans research has shown that parents are far more concerned about road safety than so-called stranger danger to their children, and speeding traffic is the most common concern in our communities.</p><p>Sustrans make a very important point:  all the North will be doing is catching up with elsewhere, where 20 mph zones are already being rolled out.</p><p>The Institute of Public Health outlined the potential health benefits arising from the introduction of a 20 mph speed limit in residential areas.  It points to increased safety for residents, pedestrians and cyclists.  Slower vehicle speeds result in perceived and actual changes to the built environment, which generate opportunities for walking and cycling.  Increased physical activity will help to tackle obesity, reduce the risk of chronic conditions, improve cardiovascular health, improve social cohesion among communities, improve mental health and well-being and reduce emissions that contribute to climate change and air and noise pollution.  We have to recognise that the 20's Plenty idea fits well with the public health agenda, not like the nonsense that we have seen from the Tories across the water, such as cutting benefits from people according to their weight.  We need to take that seriously.</p><p>People want and should be given better choices.  A better urban and community environment will make it more likely that people will make healthy choices about their lifestyle.  We need to do more to promote the health benefits associated with increased physical activity as part of efforts to reduce overweight and obesity levels and improve mental health and well-being.  That is consistent with the Health Department's strategy to tackle obesity, which aims to empower the population to make healthy choices and reduce the level of harm related to overweight and obesity by creating an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lifestyle and a healthy diet.  A number of factors can contribute and create barriers to participation in physical activity.  Fast vehicle travel is commonly cited as a barrier to walking and cycling.  In promoting cycling and encouraging greater uptake, safety remains a key concern.  The NI cycling strategy outlines that it will examine the recommendations of the speed management review in Britain and, where appropriate, introduce further measures to reduce traffic speed in the North.</p><p>The introduction of 20 mph speed limits in inner south Bristol brought about a 12% increase in cycling and pedestrian activity and a 40% reduction in the number of cycle casualties in the first six months of the speed limits being introduced.  Average speed reductions of 1&#183;4 mph to 5&#183;3 mph were reported across a range of roads in the area.  Slower vehicle speeds are associated with increased opportunities for walking and cycling.  According to the Health Forum in England, the associated benefits of walking and cycling include increased physical activity, encompassing weight reduction, reduced chronic conditions and better cardiovascular health, improved mental health and well-being, better social cohesion in communities and safer areas for children to play.  We can see that the evidence speaks for itself.</p><p>Clause 1 concerns the speed limit on residential roads.  The definition of a residential road has to be watertight; it has to address any possible anomalies.  That should be discussed in detail in Committee.  Some common sense has been shown in the Bill's memorandum, which states that the Department can apply 30 mph speed limits to residential areas if they are a main thoroughfare, but concerns about the definition need to be addressed through the Committee's scrutiny.</p><p>Clause 7 gives the Department two years to put the changes in place.  The question is:  how much will it cost?  The Committee needs to establish what the projected costs are.  Are the projected costs put forward by the Department accurate?  Is two years enough?  That is the key question that the Committee should consider.  There needs to be discussion about what changes can be made at the edges of the Bill, but we would be missing a huge opportunity if the Bill were not to be introduced into law in one form or another.</p><p>Last month, Edinburgh's bid to become the first 20 mph city in Scotland moved a step closer when councillors approved a map of 20 mph, 30 mph and 40 mph limits for the city.  The council said that it wants to dismiss a number of myths concerning that.  Those myths are equally as applicable to here as they are to Scotland.  Myth one is that slower speeds will increase congestion.  The council does not anticipate any increase in congestion.  In fact, research indicates that vehicles flow more smoothly through junctions at slower speeds.</p><p>Myth two is that slower speeds will increase emissions and worsen air quality.  Research indicates that vehicles flow more smoothly through junctions at slower speeds.  Additionally, as a result of reduced acceleration and braking, a 20 mph limit may help to reduce fuel consumption and associated emissions.  Some environmental benefit from the change is expected from helping to unlock the potential for walking and cycling, as I mentioned earlier.</p><p>Myth three is that the 20 mph speed limit will not be enforced.  The legal speed limit on all roads in Edinburgh is enforced by Police Scotland, which says that this will be no different.  Whether a street has a 20 mph, 30 mph or 40 mph speed limit, the police will direct their resources to particular problem areas as they do currently, and drivers caught flouting the limit will face a warning or fine.</p><p>Myth four is that 20 mph limits in shopping streets will be bad for businesses.  It is considered that businesses will benefit from the increased liveability that slower speeds foster in their area, with more people attracted to spend time in shopping streets where they feel safer and the environment is generally more pleasant.  Opinion research carried out in the south Edinburgh pilot area found that residents felt that the new speed limit had had a range of positive impacts, the most often mentioned being improved safety for children and for walking and cycling.</p><p>Myth five is that the city would be covered in speed humps.  The new limit will be introduced without traffic calming measures.  However, if monitoring finds that speeds remain significantly above 20 mph on certain streets despite signage, speed-reducing measures on the roads concerned will be considered.</p><p>Another myth is that signs alone do not lower drivers' speeds.  Evidence has shown that sign-only 20 mph speed limits can help to reduce average speeds and improve safety.  Evidence from the pilot scheme in south Edinburgh showed similar results:  average speed reduced by around 10% to just over 20 mph, and there was a larger fall of about 14% on roads that had higher average speeds before the limit was introduced.  Of 1,000 people surveyed in the south Edinburgh pilot area, 79% supported the 20 mph limit and just 4% opposed it.</p><p>Roseanne Brennan lost her young son Jake when he was knocked down and killed by a car outside his home on an estate in Kilkenny last June.  She is sleeping outside the D&#225;il in a bid to force the Government to reduce speed limits in housing estates.  A couple of days ago, she launched 'Jake's Law' with my party colleague Mary Lou McDonald TD in an effort to reduce the speed limit in residential areas.  To lose your son like that and go on and campaign for a law that would prevent another family going through the same trauma is an extremely courageous thing to do, and we should commend the Brennan family for that.</p><p>The speed limit in that estate in Kilkenny is 50 kmh, which is 30 mph, the same as applies in all our estates and residential areas here.  It is too high for areas where our children live and play.  Whether it is in the North or the South, it does not matter.  We have to protect our children, our families and our communities.</p><p>Sinn F&#233;in supports the Bill's principles and objectives and the approach of political parties in the House today.  Some may have issues with it, but they are willing to take the Bill to the Regional Development Committee for further consideration and amendment, if necessary.  Issues were raised about cost &#8212; the cost of the Bill can be counted in pounds and pence; the cost of not implementing it will be measured in lives.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Road Traffic (Speed Limits) Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-17", "body": "<p>I support the legislation before us, and I certainly support ensuring that it goes to Committee Stage.  As someone who has brought a private Member's Bill to the House previously and is planning to do so again, I appreciate that a lot of the work goes into it.  To the former Member and to Mr Ramsey, I say that it takes a lot of time, work and effort.  Thanks also to the staff who are involved in trying to bring this legislation forward.  A lot goes on behind the scenes that many in the public do not realise.  A number of years ago, I tabled legislation on the carrier bag levy, and the Member for East Antrim opposed that as well.  I am sure that he is delighted by its success.  The point about that is that the Bill that I brought to Second Stage was completely different from the Bill that came out the other end at Final Stage, but, at the end of the day, the policy objectives were still met.</p><p class=\"italic\">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Beggs] in the Chair)</p><p>I certainly welcome the approach by the proposer of the Bill that he is open to compromise, and I hope that other parties are open to compromise on this particular issue because it is vital to our communities.  It always comes up on the doors of constituents, whether in estates or in rural areas.  This Bill is focused on 20 mph zones.  It is about urban areas, villages, towns and cities, and I wonder whether there is capacity in this Bill to look at the issue of rural areas.  Maybe that is something that we need to look at separately, but there is a problem of people losing their life in rural areas, and those lives are just as important as those of people in our towns and cities.  Of course, this kind of proposal will meet resistance from many quarters.  As Members said, there was resistance to the smoking ban, to seat belts being made mandatory and even to drink-driving legislation.  Of course, all those things were introduced, and, within a couple of years, they became normal practice and acceptable in society.</p><p>This particular issue was raised with me two years ago by a constituent in Ballycastle concerning the speed of vehicles in Leyland Farm and Leyland Meadows in the town, and the Minister will be aware of this case.  Philip Robinson's daughter Maebh was almost hit by a Volvo estate that was travelling at an excessive speed in this residential area of some 100 homes.  He has written at length about the need for a 20 mph limit in built-up areas and he refers to the fact that we live in a driving culture where 30 mph is considered a minimum speed.  He is absolutely right.  The first thought that will come into the head of the majority of people and, dare I say, Members when it comes to 20 mph limits is that that is so slow or, \"I could not drive that slow or my car will conk out\".  That is the kind of reaction that you are going to get.  People think that 20 mph is such an inconvenience to their daily commute.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Road Traffic (Speed Limits) Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-17", "body": "<p>Yes.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Road Traffic (Speed Limits) Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-17", "body": "<p>It is a very good argument because it is proven.  The proof has already been put on the Floor that, when speed limits are reduced, even without the environmental measures, the speed ramps and so on, average speeds come down.  Therefore, the risks come down as well.  We can argue about how much the risk reduces, but it does reduce, and it makes it less likely, to one degree or another, that a child will be hit in a residential area in Ballycastle, Antrim, Carrickfergus or elsewhere in our communities.</p><p>When I refer to the natural reaction of commuters and drivers, there is no immediate thought given to the safety of children in residential areas of reducing the number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads.  As public representatives, we all know of cases where people have died on our roads; we have all been to the wakes and the funerals again and again.  In my view, there is an opportunity to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on our roads.  It will not deal with the huge problem of people losing their lives on our rural roads, but it will help to reduce the number of adults and children who are hit by cars, vans, buses and lorries in our villages, towns and cities.</p><p>The financial , as well as the personal, cost of road deaths is huge.  There is a financial cost to the Bill, and the Member has already referred to that.  Each death on our roads, in addition to the huge tragedy that it visits upon a family and a community, costs the economy some &#163;1&#183;7 million.  That does not include the cost of the seriously injured.  There are police costs, costs for healthcare, drugs, counselling, the Fire Service, insurance, the physical damage and the years of medical care that result from serious injuries.  So, when you look at it like that, it is clear that the human cost and the financial cost are greater by not supporting the introduction of measures to reduce speed and to change how people behave on our roads.</p><p>The estimated benefit to London from casualty reductions in current 20 mph zones has a value of at least &#163;20 million per year, according to the Assembly there.  In our villages and towns, we have many young families of all shapes and sizes.  As we know, many families live in homes with no gardens, and there is nowhere for children to play.  You can shout at the weans, as we say, all you like about not playing in the street, but they will do it anyway.  When your back is turned, they will be out on the road kicking a ball about.  Many people who have gardens have not had them fenced off to the road at all.  So, it is not right that in cul-de-sacs and estates vehicles can legally drive at 30 mph.  It is too great a speed limit and increases the risk of a child losing their life.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Road Traffic (Speed Limits) Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-17", "body": "<p>Absolutely.  The Committee has a great opportunity to delve into those issues in detail because the definition has to be got right.  There has to be clarity, and there should not be any opportunity for this to be defined in such a way that the Main Street in Dungiven, for example, would come under a 20 mph zone.  There will be, and should be, exceptions for main thoroughfares through towns and settlements.</p><p>When we talk of our cul-de-sacs and estates, I think of Bamford Park in my home village of Rasharkin where there has been a campaign to reduce the speed limit to 20 mph.  I know the area well, and if you were driving at 30 mph and a child were to slip out between the parked cars, they would not stand a chance.  That is not tenable; it needs to change.</p><p>We were talking about traffic calming earlier and Transport NI.  One of the inconsistencies that angers me is the fact that it has always been easier to get traffic calming towards the west than it has been in the northern area.</p><p>For example, there are road humps all the way through the likes of Ballinascreen and Draperstown, but when it comes to villages and towns in the area that I represent, there is fierce resistance to getting road humps down where they are needed.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Road Traffic (Speed Limits) Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-02-17", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for his intervention.  I did not mention Dunloy specifically; I was thinking of other examples.  Certainly, we have all been at site meetings and haggled with Roads Service officials as to what the best solution is.  There is a need for greater traffic calming, especially in the estates around places like Dunloy, Broughshane, Glenravel, Ballymena town and so on.</p><p>Like I say, the Bill that is before us today needs scrutiny.  It needs to go to the Committee and be amended.  I think that its proposer recognises that as well.  We have to get this right.  That is especially true in some of the super-sized residential estates that we now have, where there are hundreds of houses in a single estate, with many branches of avenues, closes and parks.  Because they are so large, there is more opportunity for vehicles to speed up and do 30 mph and beyond in those estates.  It would take many, many years for Transport NI to introduce all the deterrents that we would like to see in different parts of our constituencies:  ramps, mini-roundabouts, etc.  A 20 mph limit, in my view, is a deterrent in itself.  Yes, there are questions about enforcement and other physical measures to deter, but who here in this House, if they saw a 20 mph limit, would think that they would have to break that limit?  No one, I would hope.  Even if there were zero enforcement measures, introducing a limit that says that 20 mph is the law will ensure that the average speed of drivers will fall.</p><p>The Department for Transport's current guidance in England says that where average speeds are already around 24 mph on roads, introducing a 20 mph speed limit through signing alone is likely to lead to general compliance with the new speed limit.  There will be enforcement.  I will allow the Committee to delve into the issue of enforcement in greater detail.  I mentioned this to a couple of Members yesterday when we were discussing the Bill:  if the police are currently responsible for enforcing the speed limit, which is 30 mph today, on, say, five miles of road in a town, and the speed limit changes to 20 mph on that five miles of road tonight, the police would still have five miles of road on which to enforce the speed limit.  The only difference is that they will have to adjust the numbers on their speed cameras.  I do not accept that we should not strive to prevent people from getting killed on roads because the police do not have enough resources.  That is not a good enough reason to kill this Bill.  If there is an issue of resources, we, as elected representatives, should strive to address that.</p><p>Injuries are mainly fatal if a pedestrian is hit by a vehicle that is travelling between 30 mph and 40 mph.  Pedestrians who are hit at speeds below 30 mph receive mainly survivable injuries.  At a traffic speed of 20 mph, the pedestrian survival rate is increased to 97%, and 20mph limits are fast becoming the norm in many parts of Europe.  Dublin City Council was the first local authority in Ireland to introduce a 20 mph or 30 kph speed limit, which has been enforced since 2006.  This was introduced in the interests of road safety and to make the city centre more attractive to pedestrians and cyclists.  The council now plans to extend this scheme beyond the city centre by introducing a default 20 mph or 30 kph speed limit to all residential areas in the city.</p><p>There were eight pedestrian fatalities in the Dublin city area between 2003 and 2007, and 224 pedestrians and 77 cyclists were injured.  In September 2011, however, Dublin was reported to have the safest roads of any capital city in Europe.  The garda&#237; chief superintendent Aidan Reid, head of the Dublin metropolitan area traffic corps, said that the 30 kph enforcement zone was a success.  That was put down to enforcement, the ban on five-axle HGV trucks in the city centre and a huge increase in the volume of cyclists, which was down to the Dublin bike system.  If the garda&#237; chief in Dublin says that it is enforceable in Dublin, I think that the PSNI should be equally capable of enforcing such a proposal in Belfast.  Look elsewhere in the island and you will see that Cork county, Cork city, Clare and many other areas are introducing 30 kph zones.</p><p>In 2011, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging local authorities across the European Union to introduce a 20 mph standard speed limit in residential areas.  In Portsmouth, the 20 mph scheme has been well supported by local residents and appears to be achieving its primary objectives of reducing vehicle speeds and associated road casualties.  Levels of pedestrian, cyclist and public transport usage have all increased there as a result.  In London, as I said earlier, there are 400 20 mph zones, and those have reduced fatal and serious casualties by 46%.  The number of people who lose their life and are injured reduced by 46%.  Manchester City Council announced in 2012 that it will also introduce 20 mph limits.  Liverpool also plans to impose 20 mph zones on 70% of its residential roads by 2016.  The number of car-related accidents on Newcastle's residential streets in England dropped by more than half in some areas of the city following the council's introduction of 20 mph speed limits.  This is happening all over Europe and all over these islands, and we need to make sure that we are not left behind.</p><p>British Government research shows that the most effective way of saving lives is to slow traffic, and, in trial areas where speed has been cut to 20 mph, the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured fell by 50% and by 60% among child cyclists.  A Norwegian study found that a 10% decrease in the average speed would result in a 37&#183;8% reduction in people losing their lives.  The Grundy study, which was published in the British Medical Journal, found that a reduction to a 20 mph limit led to a 40% fall in casualties from collisions over a 20-year period until 2006.</p><p>Graz in Austria became the first European city to introduce a 30 kph limit in 1992, which was 23 years ago, and those limits cover approximately 80% of the city's road network.  The main aims of the scheme were to improve road safety, reduce pollution and cut noise.  The limit is in place on all residential roads, school zones and areas around hospitals, which equates to over 75% of the city's roads.  Speed limits of 50 kph, which is 31 mph, remain on the through-roads through the city.  They also found that, after two years, the majority of people who were against the proposal had changed their views, and support for the scheme is now widespread in the city.  The result of that is that the number and severity of road accidents have been reduced by some 25%.  The evidence is overwhelming.</p><p>As has been mentioned, what has greatly frustrated me, as a public representative, about my work on road safety over the years is the thresholds that have to be met in order for works to be done.  I remember when we were lobbying for safety barriers on a fast road outside a village in my constituency and beside the road were a number of trees.  It was a heavily wooded area and, given the speeds of vehicles and the shape of the road, the risk was very clear.  However, it did not meet the threshold in place.  A young man was then involved in a car accident in which he lost his life.  The threshold was then met.  The works were carried out, and there have been no serious accidents there since.</p><p>I applaud the fantastic work of Roads Service officials in significantly reducing the numbers of people who have lost their life on our roads over the years.  They do over and above what is necessary to reduce the risk on our roads.  However, I have absolutely no sympathy for the argument that the speed limit in residential areas should not be reduced from 30 to 20 mph because there are no accident statistics.  Fathers, mothers, grandparents &#8212; all those living in these areas &#8212; see the risk, and the risk is always there because the potential for human error is always there.</p><p>According to the latest figures, 162 pedestrians and 42 cyclists were seriously injured on our roads in 2013.  Seven pedestrians and four cyclists lost their lives.  That is not good enough.  A number of countries in Europe are looking at a zero tolerance approach.  As much as humanly possible needs to be done to ensure that nobody loses their life on the roads.

I will begin by commending the Assembly and Executive Review Committee for undertaking this important and necessary review.  I would like nothing more than to see more women of all ages and backgrounds entering politics.  Indeed, the debate is very timely because, as has already been pointed out, yesterday we celebrated International Women's Day.  I know that many women's organisations are keen to hear the recommendations that are outlined in the report.</p><p>The report makes a number of recommendations for the consideration of the political parties to increase female representation.  The SDLP is certainly a female-friendly party, as demonstrated by the fact that we had the highest percentage of female candidates in the 2014 local government elections.  However, we also acknowledge that we could do much more to reach 50% in female candidates and particularly to increase female representation in the Assembly and to ensure that more females hold high-profile positions.</p><p>It would be remiss of me not to mention the great work of my party colleague Nichola Mallon, who, during her current term as Lord Mayor of Belfast, has given young women the opportunity to shadow her as she carries out her mayoral duties.  In doing so, Nichola has helped young females to consider politics as a career path.</p><p>The report outlines recommendations for the consideration of the Assembly and the Executive.  Recommendation 15 refers to the establishment of:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a working group on a gender sensitive parliament.\"</p><p>Indeed, a collective group of people will certainly be required to oversee and push many of the implementations that are needed for the many recommendations.  Rather than a working group, I would have liked to see the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee.  The Assembly and Executive Review Committee is to be applauded for the work that members and staff put in to the review.  However, it already has many issues to address; therefore, it may not be possible for it to give its full attention to gender equality.  I believe that the issue deserves full attention in 2015 going forward.</p><p>If an Ad Hoc Committee was established, its lifespan would run until there is 50% female participation in the Assembly.  That would send a stronger message to women in our society that the Northern Ireland Assembly is serious about committing to gender equality.  That Committee would then play a leading role in implementing the recommendations laid out in the review, such as the development of a gender action plan, the review of the voting mechanism for family-friendly sittings, the establishment of a women's parliamentary caucus and much more.  If implemented, the recommendations in the report will bring us vastly closer to reaching our target for gender equality in politics, but we need to ensure that there is a powerful, authoritative body pushing the recommendations through.</p><p>If you want, I can add one further point.  As a member of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee, I have noticed the male dominance in the artwork in Parliament Buildings and around the grounds. We have the paintings of the late Rev Ian Paisley.  Indeed, we have one of David Trimble and, of course, our own Seamus Mallon and Mark Durkan, to name but a few.  On the drive to the \"house on the hill\", the statue of Carson is unmissable.  We need to send a message about the role that women have played and, indeed, will continue to play in political life.  We should have a permanent display of artwork or something to that effect that will complement the picture of Eileen Bell.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Women in Politics and the Northern Ireland Assembly: Review Report"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for giving way.

Before I start, I thank the Minister for attending the debate this evening.</p><p>In April this year, Members will see the new councils come in and a new era of local government begin.  The new councils of Mid and East Antrim and Causeway Coast and Glens will have responsibility for the coastal corridor and economic development along and within that route.  To put both councils in perspective, together they have 21% of the Northern Ireland land mass and 15% of the total population.  In 2013, they showed an average upward trend in population of 7%.  In the same period, the Northern Ireland average was 8%.  In both councils, the average working population is at 63%.  That is a very small snapshot of the main parts of the two councils.</p><p>The purpose of my Adjournment debate is to look at how development and investment in the coastal corridor can be maintained and improved.  The Port of Larne is the second largest port and a vital outlet for industry and inward investment, but we are not using its potential.  For example, the tourist industry is one of our biggest assets.  We do very little other than put up signs, in most cases in the wrong place.  The Port of Larne does not have a tourist office.  When you leave the ferry, you find that it is a straight run to Belfast.  There is no mention of the coastal route.  Those are just some of the minor points for the new council and P&amp;O.  Last week, I met the new manager of P&amp;O in Larne, and they agreed that there was a lot to do to promote the coastal corridor, as we both called it.</p><p>The new Tourism Northern Ireland must come up with a plan that will promote the coast to the visitor.  If that can be delivered successfully, it will increase the visitor spend and help the tourist industry to be confident enough to expand and create much-needed jobs.  There will be help from the Executive, as the Causeway Coast and Glens is one of the nine key destinations in the tourism Minister's programme for government.</p><p>For the business sector to thrive, we must look at what we have and be honest enough to answer the question about whether we are doing enough.  The A8 is nearing completion, and with that comes a great opportunity to have a business corridor from Larne.  You will be able to connect with Belfast in less than 30 minutes and with Ballymena and Antrim in less than 20 minutes.  You also have the rail link from Larne to Belfast, with links to the rest of the island of Ireland.  You can now leave Larne and stay on the motorway to Cork.</p><p>At Executive level, the Northern Ireland economic strategy is focused on five rebalancing themes.  Under the heading of \"promoting enterprise\", it clearly states that DETI and Invest NI will:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Develop, in partnership with Councils, enterprise led initiatives targeted toward increasing the ... business base, in terms of marketing, management, skills, networking, product development\".</p><p>The new councils will have transferred to them from central government powers such as urban regeneration and community development, powers to provide businesses with support and start-up advice, planning powers and neighbourhood renewal.  Those new powers will be important for the existing small and medium-sized businesses already operating.  In rural areas, they are the backbone of employment and community regeneration.  It is also vital that the new councils secure the maximum funding from the rural development programme (RDP).  That funding can be used to start up rural businesses and for the sustainability and growth of existing rural businesses. The fund will also be important for our farming industry and their businesses.  At present, the sector is under severe pressure.  That is why the RDP will be vital for farm diversification and farm incomes.  In the last programme, we saw the benefit of diversification into light engineering, renewable energy and tourism.  Councils must make the RDP one of their prime objectives.</p><p>Another element that must be prime in the new councils is the European funding structure.  Up to now, the only councils with dedicated European officers were Derry and Belfast.  From an initial talk to the chief executives of the Mid and East Antrim and the Causeway Coast and Glens councils, I think that that will be something that they will put in place, but they must have dedicated European officers to look at pulling down funding.</p><p>Another element for improvement is more high-speed broadband.  The Minister answered some of that for me.  For rural businesses to survive or expand, they must have modern broadband.  Otherwise, they will be at a severe disadvantage when competing for contracts.  Today's farmer relies on the single farm payment for income.  More and more, Europe insists on online applications for nearly all farming businesses.</p><p>Development and investment in the rural areas of East Antrim and its coastal corridor is vital if we are to sustain our rural way of life.  At present, those communities are disadvantaged by virtue of their remote location from essential facilities and services such as natural gas.  The providers have stated that providing gas to rural east Antrim would not be profitable.  That disadvantage can be addressed through the innovative use of existing services, such as community halls and schools for use in outreach and mobile services and for the benefit of new developments.  The coastal corridor and rural areas of east Antrim must be connected to all aspects of the urban economic base.  We cannot have urban and rural communities working independently.</p><p>I grew up in rural east Antrim and went to school there.  At 15, I had to leave home to serve my apprenticeship.  When we look at what we have today, we see that we really have not moved forward that much.  Public transport has not improved, and more and more we see the centralisation of services that leaves rural dwellers more and more isolated.  Community plans, which councils have to put in place, must have these issues embedded in them. In the entire rural area between Larne and Ballycastle, for example, we do not have one business park.  How are we expected to encourage inward investment when we do not have the benefits of a park for new small and medium-sized enterprises to start up in?  Any young entrepreneurs will have to leave the rural setting to avail themselves of any business space in an urban environment.  If they leave, as we all know, a good percentage of them do not come back.  We will lose that entrepreneurship and their craft and skills.</p><p>Recently, the Minister for Employment and Learning cut the funding for the learner access and engagement programme, which has been successfully tended by the Larne Enterprise Development Company (Ledcom) since 2013 for three years with an option of a further two years.  The programme was a lifeline for those who are aged 16 and over and are hard to reach, not in work, hold no more than one qualification at level 2 or above, may have barriers to learning and will declare an intention to become economically active at a future date.  These young people, without the programme that has now been taken away, have no other choice or venue to be economically active.  That whole area of the glens now depends on these programmes.  It is all right stating that they can go to a programme in Ballymena or Coleraine, but the transport to take them to those places is not there.  They are in a catch-22 situation and fall between two stools.  I ask the Minister to look at this.  She has been looking at doing programmes, but this really has to be looked at.  Perhaps she can get talking to the new councils so that they can put programmes in.</p><p>When the programme was running, it was a success in Larne, Carrick, Moyle and Newtownabbey, with a total enrolment over two years of 2,620.  DEL's actions have left little or no provision for supported community further education.  This is further evidence of rural isolation.  Where will all those young people go?  We need those young people to come back in the future, and we need the regeneration of rural areas.  We have an opportunity now with the new councils, both of which are drawing up community plans.  The Ministers now have the opportunity to sit down with the councils and draw up plans for rural areas.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: East Antrim Coastal Corridor: Industry Development and Investment"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>Will the Member give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: East Antrim Coastal Corridor: Industry Development and Investment"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>Can the Member tell me where the tourist office is in Larne?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: East Antrim Coastal Corridor: Industry Development and Investment"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for giving way.

The revised tackling rural poverty and social isolation framework was launched on 22 February 2012 as a DARD initiative aimed at facilitating a cross-departmental coordinated service.  The purpose of the initiative is to maximise access to benefits, grants and local and regional services that will help to support vulnerable rural dwellers who are already in or are at risk of poverty and social isolation.</p><p>The framework outlines three priority areas for government to target and take action against.  Those are access poverty, financial poverty and social isolation.  The Agriculture Minister, who has to be commended for leading on all of this and, indeed,  for her innovative thinking on it, secured &#163;16 million in the 2011-15 Budget period to tackle rural isolation and poverty in rural areas under the programme and has secured &#163;5&#183;5 million for the 2014-15 financial year.  That money and the work with other Departments, such as the Health Department, have enabled us to lever down a further &#163;11 million in match funding.  That is significant investment across a range of issues such as fuel poverty, disability, the elderly and young people, to name but a few.</p><p>MARA is delivered through 13 lead community-based organisations.  In the past three years, the organisations have arranged and delivered 13,700 home visits.  Those visits have generated a further 36,500 individual referrals to other Departments and agencies for a variety of grants, benefits and services.  With partnerships in the area of public health, the MARA project will continue into 2015-16, with a further estimated 3,000 home visits planned.</p><p>One of the many successes of the MARA project is the farm families health checks programme.  Since the programme started in July 2012, 6,826 clients have presented themselves for a health check at 325 venues.  Of those venues, 213 were at markets and 112 were at community events.  Some 52% of the clients were subsequently advised to see their GP.  Over half &#8212; over 3,000 people &#8212; were referred to their GP for a medical reason.  The programme has proved to be a lifeline for farmers, as their work does not leave them time to visit GP clinics and, indeed, the location of their work means that they are isolated from the rest of the community.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Tackling Rural Poverty and Social Inclusion Framework"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for his intervention.  No, I do not think so, because you will have a range of agencies coming in to deliver the programme. There will be enough to bring that round, considering the small number that was dealing with it at the start.  However, I can see where you are coming from, and I appreciate your question.</p><p>The programme has proved to be a lifeline for farmers.  Another great outcome has been the benefits check.  For long enough, farmers have thought that, because they own land, they are not entitled to any benefits.  The reverse has now been proven.  It is important that vulnerable rural dwellers can access benefits, which are a great help to family incomes.  In turn, they help address the extra costs of living in the countryside, such as fuel, transport etc.  Farmers need that extra income for their families.</p><p>MARA has amassed a large volume of information for the main Departments on health, education, community development and welfare benefits.  Rural living must be made more attractive.  That is the point: we are now sitting with all this information. The Minister has opened the door for other agencies to come in, and they must come in and deliver on this.</p><p>I will give you some numbers from my area, to give you an idea.  The north Antrim network has been delivering MARA projects since 2012.  It has visited 1,600 households for a first visit.  That has involved a total of nearly 1,900 individual assessments, with a follow-up of nearly 1,400 second visits to ensure referrals have been acted on.  The outcome of the nearly 1,700 household visits is some 4,000 referrals.</p><p>Now that the councils have been set up, they must act on that information and make it a priority that goes into the community plans.  Perhaps, the message will go out today that councils should go one step further and set up dedicated committees in their council structures that will deal with rural affairs, because, as those Members who come from a council background will know &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Tackling Rural Poverty and Social Inclusion Framework"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>&#8212; very few councils had a committee dealing with rural affairs.

In some areas, approvals have hit 100%.  In County Fermanagh, the county where fracking was outlawed by anoraks in green hats, 106 of 108 applications were given the green light.  In the Omagh council area, 88 of 92 were approved.  Through my recent research, I found that not one local council had a policy on wind farms &#8212; that augurs well for the new powers given to the super-councils, does it not?  Yet we see these ghastly monsters mushrooming and destroying the lives of people who live near them.</p><p>In the last three years, some &#163;140 million has been paid out in subsidies to the renewables sector in Northern Ireland through the renewables obligation.  These subsidies are profoundly regressive:  they take money from poor consumers, including pensioners, to give to cash-rich cooperations.  We are being asked to adopt a report that has strayed from legal disputes and potential judicial decisions, favouring the placement of turbines where they simply are not wanted.  Owen McMullan, the spokesman of the Tyrone-based Windwatch group, puts it rather neatly:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We were led to believe this would reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, but nobody in Northern Ireland is getting cheaper electricity.\"</p><p>That is true in all communities, just as it is in County Tyrone.  Wind power has already exacted a heavy cost:  it has caused divisions in rural communities and done nothing to decrease fuel bills.  However, it has given rise to serious health concerns that require a moratorium until the true impacts on people's health are known.</p><p>This turbine lobby is yet another example of the arrogance and shortsightedness of those intolerant, self-important people who have few or no ideas except massive cost initiatives that are not about green jobs but green unemployment.  UKIP has consistently exposed the failures and the money wasted by plying it into wind energy.  Rather than adopting this report to satisfy the tree-huggers, we should get the super-councils to ratify an across-the-country policy of stopping wind power development.  In doing so, perhaps the Assembly should urgently address the potential of an energy supply crisis when it next talks so boldly of rebalancing our economy.</p><p>The 'Sunday Telegraph', no later than February, dubbed the matter \"The Great Wind Farm Farce\".  It said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In a free market, no business would want to invest in a wind farm because no customer would want to buy its unreliable produce.\"</p><p>Today, in our own local farce, we have a Committee recommending the sustainability of wind farms and, regrettably, offering little to give any real assurance to the people and communities directly affected by these monstrosities.  The report recommends the sustainability of wind turbines, and, if it does not, the Committee should make it clear that that is its position.</p><p>If not, the recommendations are inadequate guidance for planning implications.</p><p>I challenge anyone to deny that the recommendations are in favour of the sustainability of wind farms, and there ends the story.  They are not recognising the rights of people, and they will, I believe, be subject to legal challenge. What of the 849 applications still out there awaiting decision?  The recommendations do nothing to make a case to refuse them planning permission.  Somehow, Members, I feel that the answer is still blowing in the wind.

There is no denying that that scaremongering added to the difficulty of recruiting and retaining clinical staff, which itself added to the question of the hospital's future.  However, the recent filling of a number of permanent consultant posts, with more in progress, has given the hospital the much needed morale boost that it has been longing for.</p><p>There is no doubt that there is a need for a hospital; otherwise such appointments would not have been made.  The hospital is a key asset in delivering integrated services to a very large catchment area.  Let us not forget that the population rises on the north coast over the holiday period at times of significant sporting and leisure events, such as the North West 200, which attracts over 100,000 visitors, and the air show, which, last year, attracted around 200,000 visitors to the area.  There are many more that I could add.</p><p>A large proportion of the East Londonderry constituency is rural and isolated, and for constituents in those areas it is vital that acute services and a 24-hour emergency department remain fully functioning.  The hospital has borne the brunt of some seriously negative press in the last year, but there have also been some very positive aspects that did not attract as much media attention.  It has had excellent results in achieving improved waiting times through initiatives such as changes to work patterns for senior medical, nursing, allied health and managerial staff and the introduction of the community rapid response service.  The staff must be commended for this because they worked extremely hard at all levels to achieve that improvement when many other hospitals were experiencing an increase in their waiting times.</p><p>The Causeway Hospital continues to provide a significant range of services, including an accident and emergency department.  I believe that morale at the hospital will continue to improve with the Minister's reassurance of his commitment to retaining these services in future.  That can only add to the continuing improvement of the services received by and care provided to this extensive area, including the north coast and further afield.</p><p>We are all very aware of the hard times facing all Departments.  However, I am sure that the Minister will continue to support the retention of the Causeway Hospital and will make his spending cuts in other areas with less impact on front-line services to the area.  I also urge the Minister and the Causeway Hospital management to continue to be proactive in advising and informing staff, users and campaigners at the hospital to reduce the risk of any further rumours escalating and to keep morale up in all areas of service from front-line services such as domestic and caring staff up to consultant and senior management level.  Historically, mistrust between senior management and staff has added to the low morale.  Thankfully, the new chief executive has so far demonstrated a very hands-on approach and worked closely with staff and elected representatives to build relationships, which can only be welcome.</p><p>The Minister has also been very proactive in his involvement with staff and user groups, which is reassuring to them and the wider public.  I have always been vocal in pledging my support for the retention of the Causeway Hospital.  I have no fear and continue to state my categorical support for the hospital and its services.  I will continue to support the staff, users and campaigners in the best way I can to ensure that those services and that hospital have a future for many years to come.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>We live in significantly different economic times than when the powers to this Assembly were restored in 2007.  Since then, we have seen our block grant reduced in cash terms by successive Administrations in Westminster, beginning with Labour &#8212; which Sinn F&#233;in prefers, according to Martin McGuinness in an interview some weeks ago &#8212; and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat Administration in the most recent parliamentary term.</p><p>Those cuts were generated by the need to make savings due to the imbalance in revenue generated through poorer tax returns and higher expenditure, primarily in the public sector.  The bottom line is that the books do not balance, and that is an economic reality.</p><p>I do not expect Sinn F&#233;in to understand that, as they do not even understand that fact in the country they affiliate to.  They would rather have seen the Government of the Irish Republic behave like the current Government of Greece rather than behave responsibly and accept economic changes which were responsible for the need to cut public expenditure.</p><p>If the truth be told, we, as a Province, are far better off as part of the United Kingdom under the Barnett formula than we would be as either an independent state or part of a foreign nation.

We are weeks away from a general election and one year away from a general election in the Republic of Ireland, where Sinn F&#233;in is allegedly standing against austerity in the hope of collecting a significant portion of the lefty party votes.  The second reason I am sceptical about the timing and wording of the motion is that Sinn F&#233;in despises the Conservative Party.  After all, the IRA once tried to murder the late Prime Minister and her Cabinet.  Furthermore, like the Scottish National Party, they wish to fuel sheer discontent and anger in order to motivate their core vote here in Ulster.</p><p>A number of months ago, we had a similar debate with regard to the revenue-generating mechanisms open to the Assembly and Executive, and the Finance Minister was clear that they were all options on which progress had been made.  However, due to Sinn F&#233;in's rejection of the Stormont House Agreement, after it got cold feet over welfare reform, one of those key revenue-generating mechanisms &#8212; corporation tax &#8212; is on hold. We have witnessed the First Minister, along with his deputy, getting a good deal for Northern Ireland, with additional means of borrowing to plug the gap created by the failure of Sinn F&#233;in to accept welfare reform and to fuel further enhancements to build our economy and generate additional revenue for Northern Ireland.  It is therefore somewhat ironic that Sinn F&#233;in stands here today and presents this motion calling on the Executive to look at ways to generate additional revenue and increase the Northern Ireland Budget, when a significant means of doing that was rejected by Sinn F&#233;in after it got cold feet.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant"}, {"date": "2015-03-16", "body": "<p>3.

I begin by questioning the timing of the motion.  As Sinn F&#233;in will be only too well aware, the Stormont House Agreement paves the way for further income-generating powers, namely the devolution of corporation tax powers by 2017.  Members will also be aware that Northern Ireland benefits significantly from the Barnett formula, gaining significantly more expenditure than we generate in revenue alone.  These are benefits of our membership of the United Kingdom and factors that Sinn F&#233;in perhaps wants to dismiss and ignore.  Rather than being grateful and appreciative, it wishes to complain.</p><p>That aside, Sinn F&#233;in and other Members will be only too well aware that any means of revenue-generating powers will cost the Province financially, with alterations made to our annual block grant.  This will result in cuts.  Before we explore any further income-generating powers, it is important and, in fact, responsible to assess whether the actual costs outweigh the benefits and the costs would significantly impact on the people of Northern Ireland, including those in west Belfast, south Armagh and beyond.</p><p>We know, looking to the future, that the Northern Ireland Executive have air passenger duty powers, which I believe will take vital routes to and from the Province.  The Executive also have rates powers, and I am pleased that the DUP, holding the Ministry of Finance portfolio, has kept rates frozen for seven consecutive years, protecting domestic customers from soaring rates amid price increases in electric and heating bills, which I am pleased to hear will drop from 1 April.  We are aware that the Department of Finance is to conduct a review of the non-domestic rates as a means of identifying possible additional revenue to ensure fairness, as well as to paint a picture of reality in these slightly more stable yet fragile economic times.</p><p>Some parties, like the Alliance Party, might like to introduce water charges or higher rates.  However, to secure additional revenue from the rates increase, it would be necessary to apply a significant increase of 1% to the regional rate.  A 1% increase would provide us with an additional &#163;5 million per annum.  This sounds like a lot of money, but, in reality, it would not do a lot for the people of Northern Ireland.  It would cut their disposable income and reduce spending in shops and local high street businesses.  I am not in favour of that, as we know only too well how fragile the high street is.</p><p>My party supports investigating revenue-generating measures, as we have done with air passenger duty and corporation tax, and agree that those are viable options open to the Executive.  However, the impact on the people of Northern Ireland of a significant loss of revenue from the block grant or an increase in rates would be severe and significant.  It will not happen, because the DUP supports the most vulnerable.

This pain is reflected through cuts imposed by Westminster to the block grant, in sharing the economic burden and reducing the deficit.  However, we must be realistic and take the positive from this Budget, which is the very fact that it exists.  While its content is not necessarily good reading, it is a statement of fact in reflection of the need for the Executive to make savings and efficiencies.  The need to make savings is known to many hard-working families outside this place who, for too long now, have had to make choices based on economic circumstances; to heat or to eat, for example.  Our only way out of this is to ensure that we continue along a path of economic growth which was present in 2014 and is expected to be present in 2015.

On the contrary, we also look at the service delivery and the extent to which our citizens get best value from the public services available to them.  One of the most interesting evidence sessions last year examined the issue of pupil attendance in our school system.  Pupil attendance and educational achievement are inextricably linked, and it is therefore vital that the education system does all that it can to ensure that children attend school regularly to make the most of their time in compulsory education. Children who do not attend school regularly are effectively forfeiting the value of their education. As a Committee, we therefore found it extremely concerning that unauthorised absence in Northern Ireland schools has increased from 27% in 2007-08 to 33% in 2011-12 and is double that reported in England.</p><p>The annual cost lost in education is estimated to be in the region of &#163;22 million.  The Committee was particularly concerned that the absence levels reported for some of the most vulnerable groups of young people, including pupils from socially deprived backgrounds, Traveller children and looked-after children, are much higher than the average. The Committee was not convinced that the Department had got to grips with the most deep-rooted issues, such as social disadvantage and unauthorised absence.  We noted that, while the Department has taken steps to improve pupil attendance over the last 10 years, it was disappointing that it had not made more progress in implementing the recommendations in the Audit Office&#8217;s 2004 report.  In particular, the Department has still not developed or implemented an overall attendance strategy.  We therefore considered the development of a coherent strategy to be the necessary starting point and recommended that that should be in progress urgently.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Public Accounts Committee: Reports and Memoranda of Reply"}, {"date": "2014-11-24", "body": "<p>Yes.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Public Accounts Committee: Reports and Memoranda of Reply"}, {"date": "2014-11-24", "body": "<p>Certainly I agree with the Member.  Those are some of the points that I will touch on later.</p><p>It is pleasing to note that the Department, in its memorandum of reply, has agreed that an attendance strategy is required and has undertaken to develop that over the next 12 months.  The strategy will also address specified groups of children and young people who require additional support.  The Committee is aware that there is already a plethora of good practice in our schools and that some schools have managed to overcome the problems associated with non-attendance, despite challenging circumstances.  Indeed, we visited Millburn Primary School in Coleraine, in my constituency, and found that it has a very proactive approach to non-attendance.  We find it very disappointing, however, that such examples are very much driven by individual schools, so we ask that the Department translate the dissemination of good practice into a coherent plan so that all schools can share expertise in a structured way.</p><p>The Department has recognised the need for a structured approach and accepted the importance of the Education and Training Inspectorate's role, with the result that the ETI is to undertake a good practice survey. The Education Welfare Service (EWS) is a specialist education support service that seeks to help young people of compulsory school age and their families to get the best out of the education system.  The Committee was not convinced that the EWS was on top of the problem of non-attendance, and, as an organisation, it appeared to be more reactive.  It lacks the basic management and information necessary to monitor attendance on a real-time basis and take pre-emptive action with vulnerable children.  The fact that 16,000 pupils a year miss almost six weeks of school yet are not known to the EWS is extremely concerning.  The Committee emphasised that that must be a priority for action and is reassured that the Department has agreed to commission a fundamental review of the EWS.</p><p>It is clear that tackling the problem of non-attendance, particularly persistent non-attendance, is highly complex, and, in certain cases, it may be necessary to involve a wide range of stakeholders.  We recommend, therefore, that the Department's attendance strategy address non-attendance at primary and post-primary school in a holistic and joined-up manner.  The Committee expects to see a collaborative strategy that includes other relevant Departments and agencies, particularly in areas such as social services, social development and youth justice.  The Department has accepted that recommendation, acknowledging that, alone, it cannot address the underlying issues of non-attendance.

Let me say that this is a very pernicious activity on the part of criminals, and I accept what Mr Bell said, that, as an Assembly, we should collectively send a clear message to those criminal groups that their time is up.  I believe that this debate is appropriate and timely, because it sends a strong message.  As the Minister said, the introduction of the new marker in relation to fuel will &#8212; I share the Minister's confidence &#8212; make it extremely difficult for people to launder fuel as they have done hitherto.  Therefore, it is the right moment to send the right message to the right people.</p><p>This is a criminal conspiracy that has been going on for years, and it needs to end now.  The effect of it has been to corrupt, first of all, those involved in fuel laundering, but also those involved in business because, at times, they have been pressurised, forced and almost blackmailed into using such fuel, receiving it and cooperating to some extent.  It has therefore corrupted legitimate business, and that is wrong, cancerous and something that, I believe, we should all try to end.</p><p>I hope that the introduction of the marker and the National Crime Agency, with its full force and resources, will give the public, and those engaged in business, confidence to resist the pressures that there may be out there in the community.  It is very important for all of us to identify this as criminality at its worst, and I take on board the remarks made by Mr McCartney and Mr Lynch, on behalf of Sinn F&#233;in, that they regard this activity as criminality.  Historically, however, the provisional republican movement was involved in it:  there is little doubt about that; it is not even speculation.  It is important that, if Sinn F&#233;in recognises this criminality now as a contemporary crime, it should also recognise that, in the past, fuel laundering was a historic crime.</p><p>It has had some very bad impacts on the environment; that has been well outlined by various Members throughout the debate.  It has affected the natural environment, natural watercourses and so forth.  However, let me say this:  with the NCA, we now have an opportunity; it has the powers that are required to deal fully with this crime.  We in the SDLP have suspected, in the past at least, that a light-touch approach was taken to this form of criminal.  I hope that we are wrong; but there certainly was a very strong suspicion that effort was not put in to deal with this type of criminality.  If that was in fact the situation, let it be in the past.  We now move to a new situation where the NCA can show its mettle and really tackle this insidious crime, which has so long dogged legitimate enterprise, business and trading throughout Northern Ireland.</p><p>I will conclude simply by saying that I hope that all colleagues in the House support our amendment, which strengthens the motion.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for his previous answers.

However, if he were permitted to speak here today as a Member, he would also say that he is committed to justice for Adrian Carroll.

He was held in custody for 30 months, which, if he had been sentenced to five years, is the equivalent of five years' imprisonment.  So, the extent of time in custody for a crime that he clearly did not commit gives rise to a very serious case of injustice.

It may well be said, \"Does that affect the case of Mr Worton?\". I think that it does, because you have to take the case in its totality.  I do not think that you can segment the case and say, \"Well, this only applied to Mr Worton. What happened to the other defendants in the case is irrelevant\". I do not think that you can do that.  I do not think that you can segment it.</p><p>In addition, in Lord Justice Basil Kelly's judgement there is sufficient to come to the conclusion that there was serious default. Central to that judgement was the fact that there was a vulnerable young man being questioned by the police and all sorts of things were happening, things that Mr Justice Kelly described as bizarre things &#8212; bizarre allegations and so forth. If you take those things in the round, that, in itself, comes to serious default, but, if you add the position in relation to the other defendants together with the position in relation to Mr Worton, you have grounds for serious default or, alternatively, exceptional circumstances.

They will take their seats, and rightly so, but they will have absolutely no influence at all.  Therefore, in a hung Parliament, it will be left to the DUP, potentially, to be kingmakers.

Well, all good things come to an end, and that will be the case for Naomi on 7 May.  However, there are others.  Her successor will carry on and do a superb job in the Houses of Parliament.</p><p>Sinn F&#233;in tells us that they are opposed to austerity and do not want welfare cuts or anything like that.  What did they do to try to stop them?  Absolutely nothing.  They would not speak to the Government, the people who make those decisions, and it was left to the DUP and others to try to influence the Government and say that the austerity measures were too steep.

We have debated the issue on a number of occasions in the House, and it is a tragedy that we still have to debate it.  We have to reflect and say that not much has happened since we last debated the issue.</p><p>I was interested to hear what Mr Lynch had to say about how his party is very concerned about this.  They are concerned about the impact that this has on the environment. They are concerned, but they have to go a bit further than simply being concerned.  Concern will not change this.  As others have said, they have a responsibility to come forward and disclose what information they have to the appropriate authorities.  While they do not do that, the finger will be continually pointed at them. You could and should and need to do more to tackle the issue.</p><p>I welcome the fact that Mr Attwood mentioned the NCA.  I know that the SDLP was slow in coming to this position, but better slow than never.  Sinn F&#233;in has still to come to a position where it will give unqualified support to the NCA in tackling criminality.  It is time that they came up to speed.</p><p>Some startling figures have been made available to us.  There is some stuff that we are already aware of, and it makes startling reading.  It is worth repeating.  For instance, NIEA officials have dealt with some 345 incidents of laundered waste being dumped since June 2012.</p><p>Ninety per cent of those incidents happen to be in the Newry and Armagh area.  That tells you something.  We are all very aware that that area is dubbed \"the no-go area\".  Is it still that way?  Do the security forces still operate in that area?  Do other agencies operate in it or is it a case of, \"No, we do not go there.\"?</p><p>It is significant and very concerning that there have been no prosecutions in relation to this sort of activity.  We have to ask ourselves the question:  why is that the case?  Why is it that there are no prosecutions?  Let no one tell me that the information is just not there.  It seems to be, or at least the perception is abroad, that where fuel laundering plants are got, they are dismantled and that seems to be the end of the story, but that is not instilling the necessary confidence in the law-abiding community.  We need to see those doing it being brought before the courts.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about what joined-up thinking and action is going on between the Department of Justice and the Department of the Environment.</p><p>This activity is ruining our environment and destroying many of our watercourses, rivers, fish life and everything else that is associated with that.  It is time that action was taken.  How many more debates do we need to have in the Chamber before we see some positive direct action taken against the perpetrators?  Since we know where the areas of concern are and since we know that 90% of the area affected is in Newry and Armagh, why are resources not being concentrated in those areas to bring the activity to an end?  I hope, when the Minister responds to the debate today, he will bring some assurances that the Department of Justice &#8212; I know that it is not an entirely devolved matter, but that makes it all the more important &#8212; will start a task force and have some joined-up thinking to ensure that this activity is brought to an end swiftly.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>Can I ask the Minister something in relation to the question that has been asked?

I have no doubt that this country will be the poorer because of his passing.  Due to his age and health, he was not to the forefront like he used to be, but his influence somehow always seemed to be there, even in the House of Lords, where others would enquire about how he was doing.  He was a man who was not out of people's minds, although he was not able to be in attendance.</p><p>He was certainly someone who led the Ulster Unionist Party during the worst excesses of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  He was a man who was steadfast and sure in everything he did.  He was unflinching, and he was undoubtedly and unflinchingly a unionist in every sense of the word.  He had no truck with anything that would be deemed to weaken the Union or to depart from it.  He was steadfast in that.</p><p>No doubt the Ulster Unionists will miss him the most as he was their former leader, but I think that unionism in general, and Northern Ireland in general, will miss him because of the man who he was.

It is very sad that the Justice Minister and three MLAs from our constituency have not found the time to come to the Chamber for this debate.</p><p>If the decision goes ahead, it will impact many people across Upper Bann.  Like my colleague, I sat on the DPP in Craigavon council from its inception, and I saw the good that was done by community policing across the borough of Craigavon.  I saw the police interact with people and communities whom they never could have interacted with before, and, slowly but surely, relationships were built up.  I fear that, if the mooted proposals go ahead, we will seriously lose out.  Relationships will not be there, and trust will not be there to the same extent.</p><p>Last week, our MP, David Simpson, Sydney Anderson and I met senior police officers at Knock and expressed our concerns.

I believe that this is probably the most retrograde step in policing since the Patten reforms in the early 2000s, and we know the impact that those had for many years.

I feel that it is important to note a widespread acceptance of cycling and the enhanced cycling infrastructure can make a notable contribution to our local economy.  When it gave oral evidence to the Committee, the Cyclists' Touring Club claimed that the economic contribution of cycling to the UK economy was just below &#163;3 billion.  On a pro rata basis, the contribution to the Northern Ireland economy is believed to be in the region of &#163;300 million to &#163;400 million.  While these figures are positive, the value of cycling to our economy can be grown in the years that lie ahead.</p><p>The Committee believes that, although the Department is experiencing a restrained budget, DRD should aim to produce imaginative proposals and appropriate bids to improve the cycling experience in Northern Ireland, because cycling not only brings notable benefit to the economy overall but enhances the tourist market in particular.  Only last year, we witnessed the outstanding success story that was the Giro d'Italia.  This was a significant cycling event, which positively portrayed Northern Ireland on a global stage and showed yet again that we are more than capable of hosting international events and doing so successfully.  Praise must go to the efforts of the Executive and others for attracting this event to Northern Ireland and also for their work in attracting the Gran Fondo of 2015-17.</p><p>Cycling tourism has many economic benefits, such as providing support to local businesses and attracting more people to visit different areas across our Province.  Additionally, the further enhancement of cycling tourism offers the potential of business start-up opportunities, such as those for businesses involved in bike-hire schemes, particularly in rural areas.  It must also be noted that cycling can play a major part in building exercise into our lifestyles, allowing us to become more healthy and reducing our risk of developing conditions and diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, type-2 diabetes and obesity.  Improving our health through exercise, such as cycling, benefits society at large.  A healthier population means that less needs to be spent on tackling problems like obesity.  As cycling is one of the most accessible activities for people of all abilities and ages, we should not underestimate the role that it can play in a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>In conclusion, I feel that the work undertaken by groups such as Sustrans, the Cyclists' Touring Club and Outdoor Recreation must be recognised and praised, as they have played an important role in education and the development of cycling in Northern Ireland.  The bike to work schemes introduced by public bodies and other organisations have also proven to be a catalyst in encouraging people to take up or return to cycling.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Cycling: Benefits to the Economy"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>Yes, I will indeed.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Cycling: Benefits to the Economy"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>Thank you.

At the outset, I apologise as I will not be able to stay for the whole debate and also because I will bombard Members with statistics.</p><p>I will begin with a review of the years 2010-11 to 2013-14.  On the upside, sickness absence rates in OFMDFM have been consistently below the average for the wider Northern Ireland Civil Service.  Against the individual target for the Department, the performance has, however, been somewhat more mixed.  In 2010-11, the Department greatly exceeded its target, which was 8&#183;2 days lost per staff member; the actual absence rate was 5&#183;4 days.  The following year, however, the rate was 8&#183;7 days against a target of 8&#183;0 days.  In 2012-13, the target of 7&#183;8 days was met, and, indeed, OFMDFM was one of only two Departments to meet their target that year.  That was followed by an increase in 2013-14:  the target was 7&#183;7 days, and the actual figure was 8&#183;9 days lost.</p><p>In noting the increase in sickness absence for 2013-14, the Committee wrote to the Department for comment.  The response was that both long-term absence &#8212; 20 days or more &#8212; and short-term absence had increased in 2013-14.  It pointed out, however, that over 60% of staff in OFMDFM had no sickness absence for that year.  That compares to 55% across the rest of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.</p><p>The largest proportion of working days lost in the Department was due to anxiety, stress, depression and other psychiatric disorders.  That accounted for 16&#183;8% of absences.  The Department noted that this is significantly lower than the rest of the Northern Ireland Civil Service where the category accounts for 31&#183;3% of working days lost.</p><p>As well as managing cases proactively in consultation with the Occupational Health Service, the Department is focused on mental health in its workplace health programme over the last year.  With respect to long-term absence, pregnancy-related disorders account for 21% of working days lost.  That compares to 7&#183;3% for the Civil Service as a whole.</p><p>The sickness absence rates in OFMDFM over the last number of years have been such that it has not been necessary for my Committee to undertake a detailed examination.  That said, the Committee for Finance and Personnel's report notes that sickness absences cost the Civil Service &#163;30 million a year, with costs to the wider public sector of &#163;150 million a year.  The Committee estimates potential savings to the public sector of &#163;37 million a year.  Given the financial pressures facing the Executive, it will be important that Departments do as much as they can to reduce the cost of sickness absence.  Therefore, I will be asking the OFMDFM Committee to closely monitor the Department's performance in sickness absence levels.</p><p>If I may, I will say a few words in a more personal capacity.  I was struck by the Chair of the Committee mentioning mental health and well-being.  Of all those statistics, the 16&#183;8% and 31&#183;3% relating to stress, anxiety and depression are key.  I am glad that we got a paragraph about mental health in the Stormont House Agreement, but that is specific to a medical solution.  I think that capacity building and resilience is key not just for the Civil Service but for our people so that they have a feeling of empowerment when things are starting to go wrong, and they know that there are routes to be followed to put that right.  I also notice what Mr Girvan said about productivity &#8212; by the way, your impression of Mr Givan is really not good enough.</p><p>Deloitte, in its 'State of the State 2014-15' report, recently highlighted that a 1% increase in productivity in the public sector would be worth &#163;64 million to the public purse just here in Northern Ireland.  The amount of savings that we can bring forward to the public purse from simply a 1% increase in productivity across the public sector is an absolutely key point for us to focus on.</p><p>I will finish by saying that you can read more about that in Deloitte's 'State of the State 2014-15' report or, indeed, in the Ulster Unionist Party Westminster 2015 manifesto.  I commend it and the report to the House.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Sickness Absence in the Northern Ireland Public Sector"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>Will the Member give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>I am grateful to the Member for giving way.

It is nice to see Europe packing them in the Chamber again for what is our annual opportunity to debate the European priorities that have been selected by Assembly Statutory Committees for the year ahead and also to reflect on the work done on their respective priorities during 2014.</p><p>The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister leads on European affairs, but those affairs impact on all Departments, so Statutory Committees have responsibility for scrutinising matters that fall within their own remit.  My Committee's report gives an indication of the breadth and depth of work being undertaken by our Committees on European affairs that affect people in Northern Ireland.</p><p>Members will be aware that last year witnessed changes to the landscape of the European Union, with elections to the European Parliament in May 2014 and the election of Jean-Claude Juncker as the twelfth European Commission president.  The Commission's work programme is normally updated every autumn, but the new Commission took office only on 1 November, and the work programme for 2015 was not adopted until mid-December 2014.  It is significantly shorter than in previous years, containing only 23 legislative and non-legislative policy initiatives.  It also includes 80 proposals for withdrawal or modification and 79 actions for review under the regulatory fitness and performance (REFIT) programme.</p><p>In setting their priorities, Committees consider issues of relevance to them in the Commission's work programme.  That enables them to identify policy and legislation planned by the European institutions for the year ahead that will have particular relevance for people here.  The work programme provides Committees with a look-ahead to see issues on which they can scrutinise and support their Department.  I am sure that all Members will agree that it is vital that our Ministers and Departments work hard to ensure that Northern Ireland's voice is heard loud and clear in any UK negotiations in Europe with other member states, especially as the UK Government are engaged in their review of competences to assess the total impact of the European Union on our citizens.</p><p>Before turning to the priorities identified by the OFMDFM Committee, I take the opportunity to thank the Assembly's Research and Information Service for the excellent work that it does in supporting Committees in selecting the key priorities from the Commission&#8217;s work programme.</p><p>The OFMDFM Committee has agreed four main priorities for European scrutiny in the coming year.  The first two &#8212; the labour mobility package and the European agenda on migration &#8212; are closely linked.  They aim to encourage and facilitate movement throughout the EU of EU citizens and those from other countries for the purposes of employment.  Those initiatives, along with the EU policy of expansion, could result in greater inward migration to Northern Ireland.  While immigration itself is not a devolved matter, the integration of migrant workers is a component of our social cohesion policy.  The Committee will maintain a watching brief on developments regarding those initiatives at an EU level.</p><p>Closer to home, the Committee aims to complete its inquiry into Together:  Building a United Community by the end of this session, the purpose of which is to help inform the Executive's approach to tackling sectarianism, racism and other forms of intolerance.  The Committee has also recently received briefings on the draft racial equality strategy from key stakeholders and relevant departmental officials, and we will continue to monitor developments in that area.</p><p>The third priority is legislation on the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  That is a continuation from the 2014 work programme, and it is a complex issue.  Indeed, the Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled that the draft accession agreement is incompatible with EU treaties.  As the proposal develops, the Committee will seek a view from OFMDFM on what the EU accession to the ECHR will mean for Northern Ireland, including any potential requirement for further legislation in Northern Ireland to ensure compliance.</p><p>The fourth Committee priority is to continue scrutinising European legislative proposals to assess compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, which is the principle that the EU shall not take action unless it is more effective than action that could be taken at a national, regional or local level.</p><p>During 2015, the Committee will also undertake other work with a European focus.  We will monitor progress to ensure full implementation of the 11 recommendations contained in our report on the inquiry into the Barroso task force.  We will also continue to press for the Executive's European priorities for 2015-16, which had initially been promised by the end of February.  Later in the year, we will review performance against the 2014-15 priorities.</p><p>I will continue to represent the Assembly on the EC/UK forum of chairpersons of the UK and devolved regional parliamentary Committees with responsibility for European affairs, and I look forward to inviting my parliamentary colleagues to the Northern Ireland Assembly later this year.  In addition, the Committee will follow with interest the work of the European division of OFMDFM, including the Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in Brussels.</p><p>I will now make some very brief comments on the work on EU matters that the Committee undertook during 2014.  In the context of ongoing scrutiny of performance against the Programme for Government (PFG) commitments, the Committee monitored commitment 26, which is to increase uptake of competitive European funding by 20% through to 2015.  That target was exceeded early in the Programme for Government period, and while that is a positive outcome, of course, it is disappointing that there has been no recalibration to reflect that success.  As each Department has a responsibility for that PFG target, I encourage all Committees to closely monitor their respective Departments' performance on the matter.  Simply put, it appears that 20% was not an ambitious figure.</p><p>The Committee completed its short inquiry into the Barroso task force and made 11 recommendations, which were all accepted by OFMDFM.   As I said, we will continue to monitor to ensure full implementation of those recommendations.</p><p>With regard to tackling the gender pay gap, the Committee received a briefing from departmental officials on the review of the gender equality strategy in February 2014 after approval for the development of a new strategy was received from Ministers.  However, a consultation on a revised gender equality strategy, which was due towards the end of last year, has not yet materialised.</p><p>The Committee has maintained close engagement with the European Committees in the House of Commons and the House of Lords and with the devolved legislatures on subsidiarity concerns on specific packages.  We engaged with the European Union Committee at the House of Lords on a proposal for a regulation on promoting the free movement of citizens and businesses by simplifying the acceptance of certain public documents.  We conveyed specific concerns for Northern Ireland regarding the potential regulatory burden, and the House of Lords communicated those issues in its liaison with UK Government Ministers prior to EU-level negotiations.  Those communications continue as that proposal develops.</p><p>Throughout the year, the Committee was pleased to host a number of visits, including from the enlarged presidency of the European Economic and Social Committee, the Italian ambassador to the UK as part of a programme of events to mark Italy&#8217;s presidency of the Council of the EU, and the Latvian ambassador to the Court of St James to discuss plans for Latvia&#8217;s presidency of the Council of the European Union.  I also opened an NI Assembly Business Trust event on what Europe means for your business, which drew a large audience of MLAs and business people to discuss EU business.</p><p>I hope that I have given the House a flavour, albeit in brief, of the range of work that my Committee has undertaken on European matters in 2014 and the continued focus on issues within our remit for 2015.</p><p>As I said, Assembly Committees have an important scrutiny role, and I now look forward to the contributions of Members on the work of other Committees on European affairs.  I will take this opportunity to thank all Statutory Committees once again for their input into the report, and finish by commending the motion and the report to the House.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: European Scrutiny Priorities 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-09", "body": "<p>T3.

Born in August 1920, Jim Molyneaux grew up in time to join the armed forces and serve in the Second World War.  Famously, he was to be one of the first Allied troops to enter and liberate the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, witnessing at first hand one of the worst examples in history of man's capacity for inhumanity to fellow man.  I have no doubt that the experience cemented the values that were to guide his adult life, not least as a politician.</p><p>Let me place on record his formidable record as an elected representative.  He was an Antrim Borough councillor from 1964 to 1973, the MP for South Antrim from 1970 to 1983 and then MP for Lagan Valley from 1983 to 1997.  He was also an Assembly Member for South Antrim between 1982 and 1986, and he led the Ulster Unionist Party from 1979 to 1995.  These statistics alone confirm that the Ulster Unionist Party has today lost one of its greatest, but there is so much more to say.  His 16 years as leader followed a 16-year period when Ulster Unionism had no fewer than four leaders &#8212; Terence O'Neill, James Chichester-Clark, Brian Faulkner and then Harry West &#8212; so he brought much-needed stability to Ulster Unionism.  That stability extended beyond the party.  Unionism and Northern Ireland also needed calm, assured leadership in the face of the ongoing terrorist campaign, and, in 1985, the political threat that was the Anglo-Irish Agreement, a challenge of seismic proportions within unionism.</p><p>As a man regarded as more of an integrationist than one in favour of devolution, it would be hard to overestimate how painful it was for Jim Molyneaux to discover that he had been betrayed by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her advisers when she signed the agreement in Hillsborough with Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald.  Jim Molyneaux fought back with dignity.  In his own words, he was not attracted to high-wire acts or media sound bites.  Working closely with the DUP in the aftermath of the agreement, Ian Paisley may have been the dominant media presence, but Jim Molyneaux was tireless behind the scenes.  He was a man of immense political guile, playing the game of political chess, focused on strategic outcomes.</p><p>The sight of Lord Molyneaux as Ulster Unionist leader wearing his medals as he laid the wreath on behalf of the party at the cenotaph every Remembrance Sunday in London was a powerful image that epitomised the ideals of dignity and service, which he embodied.  His service record is outstanding, militarily and politically.  He stood down as unionist leader on his 75th birthday.  The following year, he stood down as an elected representative, his values strong and intact.  On behalf of the party, I give thanks for a long life well lived in the dedicated service of his people.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Matter of the Day: James Molyneaux, Baron Molyneaux of Killead"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister.

The Children&#8217;s Services Co-operation Bill passed its Second Stage at the Assembly on 26 January.  It was then referred to the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister for Committee Stage.  We put out a public call for evidence, and we also wrote directly to stakeholders.  The closing date was last week.  However, written submissions are still being received by the Committee office, and our first oral evidence session in connection with the Bill will be heard by the Committee this week.</p><p>The Bill requires Departments to discharge their functions and to cooperate to further the achievement of six high-level outcomes for children and young people.  Those are taken from the strategy and are as follows:  being healthy; enjoying learning and achieving; living in safety and with stability; experiencing economic and environmental well-being; contributing positively to community and society; and living in a society that respects their rights.  The Bill also creates an enabling power to allow Departments to pool budgets.</p><p>The Committee received a briefing from the Bill's sponsor, Mr Agnew, on 14 January following the Bill&#8217;s introduction, and we also heard from officials from the Department on the same date.  Although it is a short Bill, it is clear from the discussions to date that there are a number of issues that require more detailed consideration by the Committee.  Indeed, I highlighted some of them during the Second Stage debate.  Both Mr Agnew and departmental officials have already signalled potential amendments that could address some of the issues raised, and the Committee expects to be kept fully apprised of developments throughout the Committee Stage.</p><p>There is a lot of work to be done, even though it is a short Bill.  Indeed, earlier today, the First Minister, in his statement regarding the reconfiguration of Departments, made it clear that there will be some significant impact on the delivery of services for children and young people.

As I said, I believe that the urology department is moving to Altnagelvin as of now.  That is where the uncertainty comes from.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I thank the Member who secured today's Adjournment debate.  It is a very important topic.</p><p>I visited the Causeway Hospital last Friday, where I met senior clinicians and staff about their concerns, as I have done many times before.  Many of those concerns remain the same today as they were previously; namely, the apparent lack of security of tenure, morale issues, and the perception that the Causeway Hospital has not been developed and resourced in the manner in which it should.  The Causeway Hospital is an excellent hospital with outstanding staff, but it could be better utilised, funded and equipped.  Indeed, for my part, coming from an area that is equidistant between Coleraine and Derry &#8212; that is, the Limavady and Dungiven area &#8212; I can say that Altnagelvin is better equipped and more easily accessed due to the better roads infrastructure.  The Causeway Hospital remains the choice of many for access and treatment due to the positive experience of the patients there.  Those people have voted with their feet, and that is why they are acknowledged by the clinicians and staff there.</p><p>A wide range of services and departments is available, including an emergency department; a children's ward; a day procedure unit; dermatology services; a fracture and pain clinic; gynaecology services; a minor injury unit; three outpatient departments; an X-ray department; an ICU; a maternity unit; medical photography; two medical wards; two surgical wards; a rehabilitation ward; theatres; and the Ross Thompson psychiatry unit.  That is a fairly extensive guide to the services provided at the Causeway, but if we drill down into the form and nature of the service provision, we will see a different story.  One of the clinicians I was talking to last Friday was Mr Barry Marshall, who is one of the chief obstetricians there.  He told me that, even in the maternity unit, staff are not able to take expectant mothers for the birth of their babies if they are, for example, diabetic or have an above-average body mass index, even though they would be well capable of delivering the babies in the unit in such cases.  The mothers have to go elsewhere &#8212; to Antrim or Altnagelvin.  Those are not isolated circumstances.  A less-than-holistic delivery service is available at the Causeway, and that is very much to be regretted.</p><p>Those matters have led to a degree of frustration among staff there.  There is more than a perception that it has led to difficulties in recruiting and attracting staff to the Causeway.  I am not sure what can be done to address that inability directly, but we must look at the underlying issues.  The location of the Causeway Hospital is also critical, owing to its essential place in the delivery of health provision, both geographically and physically.  For example, the glens of Antrim are a large and isolated area served by the Causeway.  Furthermore, the entire Causeway Coast attracts hundreds and thousands of visitors during the summer months.  That alone would justify the provision of adequate services at the hospital.</p><p>Historically, it might have been better to have had an acute hospital somewhere halfway between the two current hospitals at the Causeway and in Antrim, but we are where we are, so we must address the issue.  I was recently informed that the urology department is to be moved, and that too is to be regretted.</p><p>I fully support fully the Causeway Hospital, the retention and expansion of its services, and the adequate and proper resourcing of those services.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Phr&#237;omh-LeasCheann Comhairle.

As someone from the wider north-west area who attended Magee during the 80s on a number of occasions, it has always had a special affinity for me personally.  The hurt and offence caused by the Lockwood Commission report on its publication in 1965 was still very tenable even then.  That said, as my colleague Maeve McLaughlin MLA for Foyle stated in an interview with the 'Derry Journal' a fortnight ago, the landscape is very different today.  She went on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It&#8217;s been a long campaign and we are in a very different place in my view in the fact we have consensus and a very robust business case.\"</p><p>In the intervening years, the potential of Derry and the entire north-west region has been stymied by the lack of enhancement of the university status of Magee.  Real opportunities for highly paid skilled and professional employment were also held up and denied.  However, as Maeve McLaughlin said, there are new opportunities in the new dispensation.  The opening of the new science park at the site of the former Fort George is significant in the fact that, from day one, it has had almost 100% tenancy and a very close link with Letterkenny regional college and the local student body.</p><p>As my colleague from West Tyrone pointed out, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has decentralised its headquarters to the former Shackleton base at Ballykelly.  Indeed, last Wednesday, many representatives from right across the north-west were there to witness the commencement of some of the demolition work on that site, and we very much look forward to the significant provision of over 800 well-paid Civil Service jobs.  Acting as an anchor tenant, that will encourage the 60 to 70 other prospective tenants who have expressed an interest in the site.  That cumulative act of job creation could potentially mean thousands of jobs for the entire region.  It may also free up a number of positions in other Civil Service jobs in areas such as pensions and pensions credit, with many transferring to Ballykelly; therefore delivering a win-win situation for the whole region.</p><p>The single most significant action that we can take is to expand the graduate work base from Magee.  For too long, our intelligent young people have left these shores, many to, in the first instance, attend courses at universities across the water, down South and elsewhere, where they then stay after receiving job offers.  Many never return.  The commitment to the One Plan should, as the motion suggests, receive the affirmation of the Assembly and the Executive, and the creation of the north-west ministerial subgroup should be the catalyst to the delivery of the expansion of the Magee campus.  I will quote from the One Plan:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a university presence in the City which transcends traditional academic and cultural boundaries, as a proven agent for equality, inclusion, regeneration and participation.\"</p><p>I support the motion.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Magee Campus: Ulster University"}, {"date": "2015-02-23", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Phr&#237;omh-LeasCheann Comhairle.

I am pleased to note that China and Australia have confirmed their intention to visit pork establishments here in the near future, with a view to agreeing export protocols.</p><p>Ministers noted that, in October 2014, the DARD and DAFM plant health subgroup commissioned a scientific appraisal of further actions to implement the policy to contain and eradicate ash dieback in both jurisdictions.  The scientific group concluded that the eradication of ash dieback was still possible and recommended a continued programme of surveillance and eradication.  The Council also noted that the plant health section of the EU Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed met on 19 and 20 January and that both Britain and Ireland secured agreement from member states and the Commission for ash dieback measures to remain in place for 2015 while efforts continue to eradicate the disease.</p><p>Ministers agreed that, in addition to the planned proactive support by DARD and DECLG for LEADER cooperation activities, including the provision of appropriate staff resources, there should also be a focus on wider opportunities for accessing support from other EU funding programmes, not including the European agricultural fund for rural development.  They also agreed the provision of funding for 2015-16, initially to support the further development and promotion of social farming, and welcomed the ongoing cooperation of officials in closing their respective current rural development programmes, preparing for the 2014-2020 programmes and developing rural recreation.  The Council agreed that the next meeting in the agricultural sectoral format will take place in autumn 2015.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Ministerial Statements: North/South Ministerial Council: Agriculture"}, {"date": "2015-03-16", "body": "<p>I do not have that figure with me, but I am very happy to provide the Member with a figure if we have it.

I really feel that this motion is not targeted against the Catholic education system.  I want to reassure them of that.  Mr Rogers referred to the stool aspect &#8212; school, parish and home &#8212; of the Roman Catholic ethos in schools.  I have to be honest:  my children go to a school with a very similar ethos.  We learn at school; we talk about what is going on in the area, in the world around us and at home.  I find it difficult to understand how, if that is the Catholic ethos, so many schools that share it are not in the Catholic maintained sector.</p><p>As for the matter of the Catholic certificate in Scotland, it is not required.  I understand that it does exist.  We did not say that it did not exist, but it is not required in Scotland.</p><p>The Member was clearly very much against getting rid of the Catholic certificate, but we know that the post-primary schools have already dropped it.

We will be seeking the first available opportunity to repeal the exemption in fair employment legislation for teachers and to legislate to end the requirement for primary-school teachers in the maintained sector to hold the Catholic certificate in religious education.</p><p>I commend the motion to the House, and I will accept the amendment.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Teacher Employment: Inequality"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>I rise to wind on the motion, and I share the disappointment that there is no response from any Minister.</p><p>My colleague Danny Kinahan, who very rightly proposed the motion this afternoon, asked the following question:  do we actually want a shared society and a shared future?  That is something that everyone in the Assembly must ask themselves.  If some want the perpetuation of inequality, segregation and a shared-out future, they should be honest and say so.  Some recent debates in the House suggest that more than a few prefer the status quo; however, there can be no genuine shared education under the current circumstances.  Without change, the shared education concept can never succeed.  Unless schools have interchangeable staff, the whole project will not be balanced and, for practical reasons, will not work.</p><p>On 22 April 2013, the Assembly passed an Ulster Unionist Party motion calling for an end to an exception to fair employment law allowing discrimination on the grounds of religious belief when appointing teachers.  It was passed on an oral vote.  It is fair to say that nationalists were lukewarm, not to say suspicious; but, at least, Sinn F&#233;in did not oppose the motion.  In the subsequent two years, we have seen little or no progress at Executive level.  That is why we are debating the motion, which has the added issue of the requirement for a certificate in religious education to the teacher exemption from fair employment regulations.</p><p>The Education Minister indicates that he thinks that the requirement for the Catholic certificate should be removed, and that he has written to the First Minister and the deputy First Minister on several occasions.  \"I am awaiting a response\", is what the Education Minister said.  Has he had no response in nearly two years?</p><p>I want to add to the debate some remarks about the Catholic certificate requirement and its availability, or otherwise, to trainee teachers.  As we know, to take up a teaching post in Catholic-maintained nursery and primary schools applicants must possess a recognised religious education certificate.  The certificate is offered at St Mary's College; it is also an option for students on the postgraduate certificate in education courses at the Ulster University.  It is worth noting that, in contrast to the other providers, St Mary's does not use UCAS system for entrance to its undergraduate teaching course.  So, not only do you have another chance to get into St Mary's if you do not get accepted elsewhere, if you graduate from St Mary's armed with a certificate in RE you can apply for a position in any school in Northern Ireland.  That opportunity is denied to graduates of Stran.</p><p>Stranmillis College has always been, and is increasingly, a mixed teacher-training college, which provides teachers for all sectors in our education system.  I was quite concerned recently to learn that attempts made over recent years to enable its students to access the RE certificate offered at St Mary's have been rebuffed.  I understand that they are trying again.  Surely this is the way forward, at least in the short term.  It would be a positive step forward if student teachers could study for and obtain the certificate at Stranmillis, just as they can at Ulster University.  I really cannot understand why this has been blocked by certain interests.  It sounds like restrictive practices.  Let us face it:  it sounds like looking after your own.</p><p>Increasingly, the make-up of the teachers in state controlled schools reflects the wider population, but Catholic schools are effectively kept for Catholic teachers.  It is just wrong in this day and age of fair employment and equality legislation.  On that score, it really is high time that the Equality Commission had a look at this again.  I appreciate that religious instruction and the sacraments are important for many Catholic parents, but it can be done in the integrated sector.  It can also be done elsewhere in the United Kingdom.  In England and Wales, section 58 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 allows for what are known as reserved teachers in types of schools broadly described as faith schools.  These schools are allowed to reserve up to a fifth of their teaching posts for teachers selected on the basis of their competence to give religious instruction according to the tenets of that particular faith.</p><p>In the short term, I see no reason whatsoever why Stranmillis students should not be given the opportunity to study for and gain their certificate at that institution.  It is available for PGCE students at the Ulster University, after all.  The more fundamental question is this:  do we actually want a shared society and a shared future?  Members of this Assembly talk a lot about equality and a shared future, but we all must recognise that dropping the RE certificate obligation is a necessary precursor to effective shared education.</p><p>I will refer now to some contributions from other Members.  I appreciate the participation of so many people in the Chamber this afternoon.</p><p>Mr Lunn and Ms Lo from the Alliance Party, I appreciate your support for this afternoon's motion.  You support the exemption's being lifted.  You talked about the time taken to implement legislation, and therefore see your amendment as a non-legislative stepping stone towards our aim.</p><p>Michelle McIlveen from the DUP talked about using:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"yesterday's language rather than tomorrow's vision.\"</p><p>She complimented the Churches' work of pushing shared education forward.  She also said that joint faith schools should do their part in moving this forward as well.  Her colleagues Jonathan Craig and David McIlveen also spoke this afternoon. Jonathan referred to the negative impact on the shared education future, and David &#8212; sorry, Mr McIlveen &#8212; referred to the laissez-faire attitude towards this issue.</p><p>I refer now to Mr Sheehan from Sinn F&#233;in.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Teacher Employment: Inequality"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>2.

We often hear about job opportunities that are brought about by successful local companies as well as the foreign direct investments that come into Northern Ireland and the importance of having the correct skills base to fill those jobs.  However, if more than 50% of the population do not see a career in STEM sectors as a viable option, we will fall a long way short of achieving our economic potential.</p><p>As I said during the debate on STEM in schools a couple of weeks ago, the importance of matching the skills set of our young people coming up through school and into the world of work to the demands of the workplace is a central issue that we should focus on and is another example of how a proper joined-up Government would be successful.  We need to give all our young people the right advice about their future career, so that the focus should be not simply on the further and higher education sector but on our schools.  Indeed, we need to take that skills focus right back to primary schools.  The responsibility is not just with the Employment and Learning Minister but with the Education Minister.</p><p class=\"italic\">(Mr Principal Deputy Speaker [Mr Newton] in the Chair)</p><p>Women in Northern Ireland are more likely to attend university than men:  58% of those in university are women.  However, when it comes to women in STEM subjects, the figures are shocking.  Only 30% of those who study STEM subjects at university &#8212; outside medicine &#8212; are women.  Careers advice is one tool that must play a part in addressing that disparity, and l look forward, as the proposer mentioned, to seeing how that is done well at the South West College's Get Engineering careers fair this weekend.</p><p>Such a strategy, as proposed in the motion, would bring a much-needed focus on achieving targets in that area.  A number of worthy initiatives are playing a part in tackling the imbalance, and I have the great privilege of being involved in one of those:  the Science, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies Alliance (SEMTA).  SEMTA and the Engineering Training Council's Women into STEM programme, of which I am patron, set out to support 20 SMEs and four large companies to develop 50 females in a successful STEM career, to promote STEM to 1,000 schoolgirls and to establish a women's network to mentor and develop women and girls in those industries.  Initiatives like the SEMTA Women into STEM programme are vital in addressing the issue.</p><p>I commend steps taken by one of Northern Ireland's major employers to encourage more women to take up scientific and technical jobs in its workforce.  SQS, which is a local company in the digital ICT sector, has signed up to a STEM equality charter.  The STEM charter was launched by the STEM business group with the Equality Commission in June 2014.  To date, 28 STEM organisations, including several other major IT companies, have signed up to the charter to demonstrate their commitment to equality for women in STEM posts.  The charter is about assisting businesses to make their workplaces more welcoming and supportive for women, and thus improve the gender balance.</p><p>In 2013, when the Employment and Learning Minister made the statement to which we refer today, he highlighted a review of the cross-departmental gender equality strategy as well as the drafting of a Northern Ireland childcare strategy that should address childcare as a barrier for women returners.  Where are we now on those two strategies?  It is notable that the proposer avoided mentioning OFMDFM at all, yet it is the lead Department on gender equality.</p><p>In Dr Farry's statement of 3 June 2013, he mentioned a joint economic inactivity strategy with DETI.  In responding to the debate, I hope that the Minister can provide the House with an update.</p><p>The most recent figures show generally promising economic figures.  However, 27&#183;8% of working-age people in Northern Ireland are defined as economically inactive.  This is the highest of all UK regions.  That has been the case for a long time and, worryingly, there is no downward trend.</p><p>It is obvious that gender imbalance will not be served overnight.  We all need to work together towards the same goal despite differences we may have on how we get there.  An Executive strategy and action plan that addresses specifically gender imbalance in the STEM sectors should go a long way in setting out the road ahead.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for giving way.

I, along with the Committee Chair and other members of the all-party group, made representations to the Regional Development Committee, and I thank it for giving us the time to do so.</p><p>Many people at home listening to the debate will not have been able to miss the huge excitement generated last May by the Giro d'Italia and the great success of the pink celebrations across Northern Ireland.  Everyone embraced Giro d'Italia fever and turned out in their masses to watch and cheer on the cyclists who came from all over the world to our wee country.  There was also great community involvement, with the spread of pink in town and country.</p><p>Of course, we have our very own home-grown successful cyclists, such as Wendy Houvenaghel from Upperlands in County Londonderry, who all work to highlight the increase in Northern Ireland's interest in all things cycling.  Speaking of mid-Ulster, I cannot go on without mentioning the very challenging mountain-bike trails in Davagh forest, which the Chair of the Committee mentioned.  It is in the heart of my constituency and is a place for people of all ages to trek the mountains on their bicycles.</p><p>It has been a prime time for the Minister for Regional Development to attune his desire for a cycling revolution, and I commend him for the time that he has spent researching what is successful in other cities and countries in Europe and further afield, for developing a bicycle strategy and for opening a consultation to listen to the views of the people of Northern Ireland.  I am certain that there has been an uptake in cycling in the past year or so, with an increase in numbers joining cycling clubs and making regular visits to mountain trails in various parts of Northern Ireland.  Of course, we look forward to the Gran Fondo later this year, and I hear that a few MLAs may be taking part in that.</p><p>As someone who lives in a very rural part of Northern Ireland, a bicycle, unfortunately, is not a method of transport that I can use to get to work or that my children can use to get to school.  However, it is very important that we combine cycling as something that we can do for transport and enjoyment in our vision for its future in Northern Ireland.  Cycling can be used for even part of a trip, and that is a mindset that we need to encourage.</p><p>As regular cyclists, I and my husband and children cycle for enjoyment, and it is important that we do so for our health and well-being.  Cycling is something that we do together as a family, and we use our cycling time to teach the children about road safety and how to treat others.  In other more urban areas, cycling has the ability to become a real and meaningful method of transport, and the work that can be done to encourage an increase in that is the mixed responsibility of the Department for Regional Development and the Department of Health.</p><p>I understand that over &#163;100 million is saved in health care owing to the high level of cycling in Copenhagen.  Therefore, the Department of Health can work to promote cycling as part of healthy living and the Department for Regional Development can work to provide a better infrastructure for cyclists to cycle on.</p><p>The timing has been right for the Regional Development Committee to take an interest in cycling and, in particular, to analyse the benefits of cycling to the economy.  Generally, the report is very positive and shares the Minister's vision for the future of cycling.  It has gone somewhat further than simply being a critique of the Minister's bicycle strategy.  I was keen to read the five articles in the terms of reference.

I too welcome the report and thank the Committee Clerk and the staff for compiling it.  It was a massive job.  The inquiry started long before I was a member of the Environment Committee.  In fact, I think that it started almost a year before I joined it.  It is an issue that every MLA can relate to.  There is no doubt that every elected represented has been lobbied in support of or against a wind turbine in their constituency or maybe on both sides of the argument, if you are lucky.  Unfortunately, in many cases, it has pitted neighbour against neighbour.  I therefore welcome the publication of the inquiry's report, as it seeks to bring some clarity to an issue that is becoming increasingly divisive in communities across Northern Ireland.</p><p>Turbines are a relatively recent phenomenon.  Until relatively recent times, consent for electricity generation was not a particular problem.  The Executive set the targets to achieve 40% of electricity from renewable sources.  Interestingly, the Member to my left, the Member for East Antrim, claimed that that target was unachievable, even though I understand that, for a year, he was the Minister of the Environment, which was the Department that championed it.</p><p>With the development of technology and the increased drive for renewables, it was inevitable that planning consents would become an issue.  Instead of Northern Ireland being overloaded with wind turbines, there needs to be an overarching strategic view on the siting of turbines, and planning consent is key to that.</p><p>Many people, not least applicants, have criticised the system for taking too long, but it is essential that all factors be taken into consideration before decisions are made.  Anything else would expose the Department to undue risk.  We trust that the new councils will show the same caution when they take on many of the decisions after 1 April but not necessarily the extended delays that can come with it.</p><p>There were problems with planning policy statement (PPS) 18, so the strategic planning policy statement (SPPS) at least presents a useful opportunity to put some of those to bed.  That includes more obligations on developers to abide by noise limits and to ensure that all the relevant information is produced in the application process.  The noise factor raised an interesting discussion in Committee, with research and evidence, and I am sure that the Minister will seek to take those on board.</p><p>Along with noise pollution, one of the regular bones of contention with wind turbines is their proximity to residential properties.  The Committee report makes a sensible suggestion, and we should look to extend the distance from the current 90 metres status.  The recent fall of a wind turbine in County Tyrone highlighted that need.</p><p>As the Committee learned during its evidence sessions, it is not just the noise that you hear standing nearby; often, it is more inconspicuous than that.  So, whilst the fleeting observer may hear little, residents, backed up by evidence, talk of invasive noise.  That leads to an array of problems, including sleep disturbance and deprivation.  It is because of that disturbance that the Committee believes that the Department needs to improve the procedures for measuring that and, eventually, come to its own conclusion as to what an acceptable level of noise pollution is.</p><p>I welcome the new cautious approach recommended in the SPPS to the siting of turbines in areas of outstanding natural beauty.  In fact, at this stage, I thank the Minister and the Department for working with the Committee on the issue, particularly on the drafting of the SPPS.</p><p>An important issue in the report is the call for economic considerations for assessing applications to be better defined, as it is very important not to be ambiguous in this matter.  Perhaps that could counteract the presumption of favour in PPS 18.</p><p>To conclude, wind turbines draw contention in every art and part of Northern Ireland.  Their positioning is key to their success, yet that same point can strike fear and cause annoyance and even have implications for health.  The Committee inquiry drew many positive conclusions and recommendations, and I commend them to the Minister.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Wind Energy Inquiry Report"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>I might have missed the answer to the last question, although I have been listening to all the rest.

It was never justified in any circumstance.  I do not need to be prompted by Sinn F&#233;in on when I need to express my sympathies to anyone.  We stand totally with that family on the loss of their son.  It should never have happened.  It was wrong and they deserve the support of the public.</p><p>They also deserve justice, and justice will be done when the people who committed that murder are brought before the courts of law and found guilty of having carried out that crime.  Colin Worton was not one of those people but was an innocent man who was drawn into this and held for two and a half years although there was not the evidence to support a conviction.  Colin's desire to have his name cleared conclusively is something that he holds very strongly.  Everyone recognises the man's innocence, but we want to see more done on that front.  We would also like Minister Ford to take a look at the circumstances of the case.</p><p>I listened to the debate between Ms Kelly and Mr McCartney, and I do not think that we would be supportive of throwing the doors open for every single person who was held for a period of time to receive compensation.  The nature of justice is that people are brought before the courts on the basis of evidence that is before them and the Public Prosecution Service has a course of work to do in demonstrating that there is likely to be a conviction.  I do not believe that that course of work was well applied in the case of Colin Worton, and, therefore, the circumstances are different from the discussion that took place between the two aforesaid Members, which would open the doors in a way that would lead to hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation having to be paid.</p><p>I think that Minister Ford has the ability to look at this, consider the ex gratia payments that Mr Maginness referred to and give proper reasoning and understanding to any compensation that could be paid to Mr Worton.  Our sympathies are with him on what he has had to endure and the damage it has done to his life as a consequence.  Indeed, it is the same for the others who were found innocent of the crimes committed against Adrian Carroll.  They served many years in prison.

It is particularly painful for them to be forced to transgress the direction of their consciences.

Strict conditions for the provision of public funding to parties must be in place.  The sources and spending of political parties' funds should be clear and accessible to the media and the general public.</p><p>It is important to say that the Assembly Commission had a strategy day.  We spent almost half a day looking at very emotive, very sensitive and very delicate issues.  Ms Caitr&#237;ona Ruane did not attend that, and she may have had good reasons for not doing so.  Because of the extensive discussion we had, there was, as Judith Cochrane said, a balanced budget brought forward.  It is unfortunate that the independent panel did not accept guidance, through a letter from the Speaker, on the proposal we brought forward for the reduction in the childcare allowance to Assembly staff, and, simultaneously, we wanted to reduce the childcare allowance to Assembly Members.  Sadly, that was resisted, and the panel did not think it was relevant to do that, although that was clearly what we wanted.  It is unfair now:  there is no equality in this House as a result of a decision &#8212; an exceptional determination &#8212; by the independent panel, which refused the guidance from the Assembly Commission but yet and all brought forward another determination about the consumables, which, as the mover of the motion, Judith Cochrane, rightly said, will have a detrimental effect on the constituency services to all MLAs.</p><p>It is not a huge amount of money.  It was initially &#163;1,000.  The Assembly Commission, in trying to get a proper balance, decided and agreed on a 25% reduction, only to find that the panel had decided to remove it entirely.  That was wrong.  There is no accountability.  While the creation of the panel brings independence, there is no accountability with it.  It increased the level of salaries to MLAs and simultaneously reduced the office allowance costs by the same amount over three years.  It was never part of the panel's mandate to make cuts or savings, and it is wrong on this occasion.  The SDLP will be seeking an urgent meeting with the panel to discuss that.</p><p>At the second meeting, when we were discussing the budget that had been agreed consensually at the first meeting, Caitr&#237;ona Ruane did raise the issue of a 10% cut.  A 10% cut in financial assistance, including to the Whips' allowance, which helps to service and manage the party teams, would have forced parties to make cutbacks in human resources.  There would be no other way to do it.  We looked at all the areas of funding that the Assembly Commission has, and the main one is human resources.  We looked at catering, cleaning and security.  We have seen a significant reduction in the amount of money that we are paying to the Northern Ireland policing service for the security that is necessary to protect Members and people who are using the Building.</p><p>The Assembly Commission, on behalf of the parties that sit on it, has taken the right decision to have direct impact on Members through the childcare allowance &#8212; a proposal that has been blatantly ignored by the independent panel &#8212; and a 3% cut to the financial assistance to parties and the Whips' allowance, which is fair and reasonable.  Those were tough decisions and the meeting of the full Assembly Commission &#8212; apart from Caitr&#237;ona, who could not make it &#8212; was tough.  We spent upwards of four hours going through the elements of the budget to make sure that we got the round and balanced outcome we have.

I congratulate all the staff at the Causeway Hospital, who have proven that they are professional, friendly and caring.  I have heard those words used many times by patients and relatives alike.  I also want to be positive in my contribution, as recruitment and the hospital's future are being positively addressed.</p><p>I have spoken to representatives of the Northern Trust and have learned that five consultants have been appointed in surgery, gastroenterology, respiratory medicine, obstetrics/gynaecology and internal medicine.  I have also learned that a consultant cardiologist is being recruited for a joint post between the Causeway and Altnagelvin hospitals.  Specialist doctors in general surgery, obstetrics and anaesthetics have also been appointed.  That is fantastic news and will ensure continuing and permanent services at the Causeway Hospital.</p><p>I want to outline my support for the Causeway Hospital and express my relief that the chief executive has stated his commitment to it.  That has been reflected in the appointments that have been made, which will, hopefully, ensure that the other posts are filled soon.  All those positive changes add great confidence and boost morale among the Causeway Hospital's staff and, indeed, the wider community in the causeway area.  The list of appointments does not show a hospital that is earmarked for closure.  Indeed, I welcome the fact that those new appointments will secure the Causeway Hospital in line with the commitments from the trust's chief executive, Dr Stevens, Dr Fred Mullan and others.</p><p>At some stage, a great boost to the hospital and staff would be a programme of separation and independence for the Causeway and Antrim hospitals.  I also welcome the trust's developing a service for elective surgery that will further secure the future of the Causeway Hospital and the vital role that it plays for the local community and visitors to the area.</p><p>Indeed, the tourist sector benefits greatly from the presence of the Causeway Hospital.  The North West 200, the air show and Portrush raft race are just some of the major attractions that we look forward to in the north-west. We may have the Open golf tournament, perhaps as early as 2019, when the Causeway Hospital will play a vital role for dozens of tourists and visitors to our beautiful north coast as well as our student population.</p><p>There is also a close working relationship between the trust, the unions and the voluntary and community sectors that, I hope, can be extended in future to serve the entire population of the Causeway area.  Despite scaremongering from some quarters, I have always believed that the Causeway Hospital can be maintained as a viable facility, and I have not changed my belief.  The most important people of all in achieving this are the staff, who form a remarkable unit of professionalism.</p><p>In conclusion, I quote the Northern Trust:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Northern Trust is well placed to deliver real and effective integration of hospital, community and social care services.  In the Causeway and Glens area, this would be based around an acute hospital in Coleraine with an emergency department and supporting clinical services.\"</p><p>Those words bring me reassurance, as I hope they do to all the staff and residents of the area.  The Causeway Hospital has a positive and important future in health provision for the north-west of Northern Ireland.  I and my colleagues, including the Health Minister, will always be available to support the chief executive, staff and others in their endeavours to keep a world-class health facility at the Causeway Hospital.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>Will the Minister state whether community transport services for the rural population, such as those in the Limavady area, will be retained to reduce the impact on social deprivation, isolation and health visits?

As many Members mentioned, it follows on from a debate on organised crime that my colleagues tabled in the House of Commons at the beginning of March.  Of course, fuel laundering was a significant part of that debate.  Perhaps, this time next month, Mr Bell will be joining them on the green Benches at Westminster and can continue some of the work he has started on these blue Benches today.</p><p>This is a serious issue.  There needs to be coordination between the House of Commons and Stormont.  This is one of those issues that requires joined-up collaboration among a number of agencies, whether it be the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the NCA, the Department of Justice here, the Ministry of Justice at Westminster and, of course, HMRC.  It is a crime that costs the UK &#163;400 million per annum.  Here in Northern Ireland, as many Members outlined, it is &#163;80 million annually, according to the figures that we have.  As Mr Bell outlined at the beginning of the debate, it accounts for 13% of the fuel trade here in Northern Ireland, compared to only 2% in Great Britain.  As nearly all Members mentioned in their contributions, there is an impact on the environment, the water supply because of illegal dumping, and legitimate trade, and there is a huge loss of revenue that should be going to Treasury.  Mr Bell put that in context when he said that the amount of revenue lost is the equivalent of 857 nurses.  It puts it in some context when we learn of that.</p><p>One of the concerning themes throughout the debate was the fact that a number of Members questioned why little or no action has been taken against those responsible for fuel laundering in Northern Ireland.  Many Members pondered whether a blind eye is being turned to that sort of criminality.  Mr Maginness asked whether there was a light touch towards that sort of crime.  That is something that we have to be very concerned about.  There is a saying here in Northern Ireland that even the dogs in the street know what is going on.  Having followed Mr Bell's Twitter feed and his electioneering, I do not think that there is a breed of dog that he has not talked to in his research for the debate today.  On a serious note, it adds to the level of cynicism amongst members of the public if they feel that this sort of crime is going on, they know who is involved in it, but they do not see those individuals being brought before the courts and, ultimately, being put behind bars.  Indeed, as one Member mentioned, when we hear reports of the fact that, before the law authorities arrive at one of the plants, laptops have been destroyed and papers have been removed, it suggests that somebody was tipped off.  That adds to the cynicism that there is, perhaps, in the public; I have certainly picked up on it during the debate here today.</p><p>Mr Bell talked about it being a crime with consequences.  That is a hugely important comment; it is not a victimless crime.  The profits being made from fuel laundering quite often fund illegal terrorist activity; they fund organisations that are intent on destroying and murdering people in our community.  He also raised the concern about the lack of prosecutions and convictions.  That theme ran through the contributions of all Members this afternoon.</p><p>Mr Attwood, in proposing the amendment, which we, on this side of the House, are comfortable with supporting, spoke of the importance of the NCA now operating in Northern Ireland.  That is a positive contribution that the SDLP has made.  It is unfortunate that it took so long, but we are there now; that is the important thing.  He said that it is important that no individual or organisation be off limits.  He suggested that this piece of work is a test for the NCA and that the public will be looking for action.  That is right.  He talked about the plants that are active in south Armagh, the 50 tons of waste being dumped and their capability of producing significant amounts of illegal fuel annually and yet only one arrest has been made.  If anything comes out of the debate today, it is our frustration that we do not see convictions of those involved in that illegal activity.  He also talked about the need to seize the assets of criminality; something that the Minister mentioned in his contribution as well.  He also talked about some of the other counterfeit materials, whether that be tobacco or alcohol.  I will resist talking about the impact that plain packaging will have on making it easier for counterfeit tobacco products in Northern Ireland.</p><p>In Mr Lynch's contribution, he condemned those involved in illegal fuel laundering and called them criminals, but, interestingly, he did not say that he would support the NCA in trying to put those criminals behind bars.  That is where Sinn F&#233;in is becoming increasingly isolated in the community; it will not support the NCA in tackling not just fuel laundering but a range of crimes that are affecting people across Northern Ireland.  Mr Beggs talked about &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I will.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>One would imagine that that logic would follow.  Indeed, when Sinn F&#233;in talks about those involved in terrorism today being wrong, it follows that those involved in terrorism in the past were also wrong.  I am quite sure that that point will not be lost on the public.</p><p>Mr Beggs made the point about the dangers of fuel laundering to public health.  He talked about the toxins that are released into the countryside and the water supply.  He appealed for those with information to bring it forward.  Indeed, to follow on from the point, given that Sinn F&#233;in has said that those involved in this sort of activity are criminals, it follows that it should also be encouraging people to bring information forward to the police.  Mr Beggs asked what is going on with law enforcement, which is a theme that, as I said, many Members raised.</p><p>Mr Dickson, who along with me tabled the motion on the NCA that was successfully passed at the beginning of February, said that he hopes that the tide has turned, pointing out the number of fuel plants that have been dismantled and the fact that the cost of fuel is coming down.  As much as I would like to agree with Mr Dickson &#8212; I hope that he is right &#8212; I will point out that a number of individuals are concerned at the type of activity that is going on and that, although we are discovering fuel plants and shutting them down, we are not necessarily seeing convictions.  I think that the public would want to see fuel plants being shut down and people being brought in front of the courts and put behind bars.  The cost of fuel has come down of late, although I suspect that that will not last for too long with the manipulation of the market in the Middle East.  The people who are involved in this sort of activity are making huge profits.  That will continue, and I do not think that that situation would deter them.</p><p>Mr Dickson and the Minister talked about the fuel markers, but Mr Bell pointed out at the beginning that there are serious concerns about whether the type of marker that the Government favour is the best available.  As the Minister acknowledged, I mentioned the lack of roadside capability.  I think that that is important if we are to tackle this properly.  I know that, in a House of Commons debate, many Members pointed to some of the technology that the Brazilian Government were able to use to help to counter the illegal fuel trade there.  Mr Dickson, in concluding, called on Sinn F&#233;in to \"tell us what you know.\"  I think that many Members would agree with that.</p><p>Lord Morrow said that it is a tragedy that we are discussing this issue here once again.  It shows that little improvement has been made.  He asked whether south Armagh is a no-go area for law enforcement agencies and whether HMRC is too scared to go there.  If HMRC is to do its job properly, it is important that it is given support from other law enforcement agencies.  I think that we all want to see HMRC go to areas of south Armagh where perhaps it is not particularly welcome and tackle this issue head on.  That is hugely important.</p><p>Mr McCartney said that he supported his colleague Mr Lynch's comments, and he warned the House against media reports with unnamed sources.  He did not, of course, question that this type of activity is going on, nor did he say that he would support the NCA in tackling it.  That is important to note as well.</p><p>My colleague Jonathan Craig, a member of the Policing Board, of course, talked about the role that fuel laundering profits played during the Troubles.  He said that those profits were used to bankroll the Provisional IRA.  That point was also made by Mr Alban Maginness who, in his conclusion, talked about the lucrative nature of the business and the complex escape tunnels, lookout posts and material at the fuel laundering plants.  Those again show the sophistication in some of the plants that are making this illegal fuel.</p><p>Mr Patsy McGlone talked about the poison of the toxins that are released, and he made the important point that, where this activity is going on, people are poisoning their own communities.  It is the people who live beside them and who the launderers are friendly with and, in many cases, related to who are suffering from these toxins being put into their waterworks.  I think that that it is an important point.  He also, in common with other Members, asked why nobody is ever at the fuel plants when they are discovered.</p><p>Mr Allister spoke about a number of issues.  The Minister highlighted the difficulty in catching people in the act, as these plants operate independently, are automated and can be unattended.  However, Mr Allister pointed out that many ordinary farmers are caught out in some of their activities by satellite imagery.  He asked why similar technology cannot be used to see plants where large-scale lorries and tankers are coming and going at different points of the day.  I am quite sure that there is technology that could see where that kind of activity is going on and that would help law enforcement agencies to bring those people to book.  He said that it was inconceivable that this level of fuel laundering was going on with nobody knowing about it.  He finished by calling for tough guidelines in the event of a conviction.  I am sure that all law-abiding people would concur with that.</p><p>The Minister spoke about a number of issues.  I think that it is important that we look at whether fuel stations that are selling illegal fuel should be named and shamed.  I do not buy the argument that they are changing their supplier every other week.  Therefore, I think that they have a responsibility to ensure that the product that they are selling is legal and has its duty paid.  We will watch progress on that with interest.  It is important that we do not take our eye off the ball on this issue.  There is concern across the community, and I look forward to more convictions in the future.  I certainly give my support to the law enforcement agencies in tackling the issue.</p><p class=\"italic\">Question, That the amendment be made, put and agreed to.</p><p class=\"italic\">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.\n\nResolved:</p><p class=\"italic\">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the continuing high levels of fuel laundering, the organised criminal activity surrounding it and the evident lack of criminal prosecutions; notes the environmental damage caused to the countryside; recognises the financial losses suffered by Her Majesty's Treasury and legitimate fuel operators and the consequential serious implications for the local economy; further notes that legislation extending the role of the National Crime Agency in Northern Ireland has completed its passage at Westminster and that the National Crime Agency must now demonstrate that it will deploy its full powers and resources against any and all persons or organisations involved in fuel laundering and other organised crime; and calls on the Minister of Justice to ensure action is taken at every operational level to secure greater numbers of prosecutions for this serious crime.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Fuel Laundering"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for highlighting the specific issue of the marker.

As the Chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee has already outlined, the statutory rule brings the PSNI into the list of organisations that the Attorney General can issue guidance to on the exercise of their functions in a manner consistent with international human rights standards.</p><p>The Committee has considered this issue from as far back as February 2013, when the Attorney General wrote to the Committee advising that he proposed to amend the list of section 8 organisations to include the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  The Committee considered this issue a number of times and consulted with the Attorney General, the PSNI, the Policing Board and the Department of Justice.</p><p>The PSNI indicated in its response to the Committee that it is subject to the close statutory scrutiny of the Northern Ireland Policing Board on how it carries out its duties and functions in relation to human rights standards and that, under section 52 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, the PSNI is bound by a code of ethics, which is intended to lay down standards of conduct and practice for police officers and to make police officers aware of their rights and obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is the PSNI&#8217;s view that it was not necessary to add the PSNI to the list.  The Policing Board performance committee also indicated that, in its view, the inclusion of the PSNI on the list would be both unnecessary and potentially unhelpful as it may be in contention with the Policing Board&#8217;s oversight role in monitoring the PSNI&#8217;s performance in complying with the Human Rights Act 1998.</p><p>The Committee sought the views of the Attorney General on the issues raised by the PSNI and the Policing Board. In response, the Attorney General highlighted the fact that guidance under section 8 provides direction on how to achieve compliance with international human rights standards rather than with a base minimum, and that the guidance could provide the PSNI with more detailed and practical advice to assist officers carrying out their day-to-day duties.</p><p>The addition of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to the list of organisations would also enable him to provide guidance that links across all the criminal justice organisations.  The Attorney General also indicated that the role of the Policing Board to monitor the Police Service of Northern Ireland's performance in complying with the Human Rights Act 1998 is entirely distinct from the role that section 8 guidance would play in assisting the PSNI with human rights compliance.  The Committee also sought further clarification on the role of the Department of Justice and the mechanism to amend section 8.</p><p>Having considered the views expressed at its meeting of 30 April 2014, the Committee agreed that it was content to support the Attorney General's proposal to add the PSNI to the section 8 list of organisations.

While the Committee is content, one member, Mr Elliott, indicated his opposition to the inclusion of the PSNI on the list of organisations to which section 8 guidance applies when considering both the proposal and the statutory rule.

At a meeting in January this year, the Committee reviewed the consultation responses and agreed that it was content for the Department to progress its proposed statutory rule.

Before I turn to the Committee's consideration of the statutory rule, I wish to draw attention to the Committee's dissatisfaction with the Department's management of the four statutory rules before the Assembly.  The Committee considered and agreed that it was content to approve the four statutory rules at its meeting on 18 February.  However, the Department relaid them in the Business Office five days later, with an explanation that it had made minor changes to the rules following suggestions by the Assembly's Examiner of Statutory Rules.  This required the Committee to consider and agree to approve the four statutory rules for a second time, on 4 March 2015.  As much as we enjoy statutory rules, we do not enjoy them so much that we wish to do them twice.  Although the Minister will be relieved that we are not calling for his resignation at this time, the Committee agreed that it would write to the Department to say that this was managed in an unsatisfactory way.  To avoid duplication of work, we ask that the Department communicates better with the Committee when changes are made.</p><p>Now back to the rule in question.  In September last year, the Department advised the Committee of the suite of legislation that was required to implement civil legal services.  That included the requirement for a statutory rule to establish a procedure for appeals against decisions on applications for funding by way of civil legal services and provide for the establishment and composition of independent appeals panels.  At that time, the Committee was content for the Department to undertake a targeted consultation on the draft statutory rule.</p><p>At the meeting on 14 January of this year, the Committee considered the responses to the Department&#8217;s consultation and the detail of the new appeal process proposed by the Department, which had been revised as a result of the consultation responses.  The Committee noted that the appeal panel will comprise three people drawn from a wide pool of suitably qualified people from a range of professional backgrounds and appointed through a public appointments process and that there would be a requirement for the presiding member of the panel to be a lawyer.</p><p>At that meeting, the Committee agreed that it was content with the Department&#8217;s proposed statutory rule.  As I outlined, the Committee agreed to recommend that the statutory rule be affirmed by the Assembly at its meetings on 18 February and 4 March and therefore supports the motion.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Civil Legal Services (Appeal) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-10", "body": "<p>The CJI report on Magilligan highlighted the level of drug use as being high, and there were no disciplinary consequences for positive drug tests.

I noticed the number of people who made reference to it on my Twitter feed and Facebook feed and put up women from right across the world who inspired people, whether they were in business, politics, sport or community activism.  It was a very positive message and an indication of the positive role models that there are out there for young women.  Sadly, I doubt that the report will get an awful lot of media coverage today, given the actions of Sinn F&#233;in on welfare, which is disappointing, because I think that it is an important issue and one that should receive significant amounts of media coverage.</p><p>I only joined the Committee in the last number of months, so I did not have the advantage of the evidence sessions like other members did, but I have read through the report and some of the evidence sessions, and there are some stark findings.  One would imagine that, given the fact that 50% of the population or thereabouts is female, a representative body such as the Assembly would also be around 50% female and that we would expect to have around 54 female Members of the House.  The fact that we do not and that only a quarter of Members are female clearly says that there is a disconnect between the proportion of women in society and the proportion of women represented here in the Chamber, and that is something that is of concern.  We are far from the worst Chamber anywhere in the world.  There are Chambers much worse than ours in terms of their representative nature.</p><p>I was struck by looking at the particular areas.  I know that the Committee went to Wales and to Iceland as part of its investigations.  I notice that the Seychelles is much more representative in terms of females, and I wonder why the Committee did not take the opportunity to go for a study visit there.  But why we have a lower number of women coming forward to put themselves up for election and, indeed, among those who are elected is a serious issue.</p><p>I read an article over the weekend in 'The Guardian'.  It is not a newspaper that I read very often, but it said that there would be a significant number of female candidates for the Westminster election, which is only a number of weeks away, and they imagine that the next cohort of the House of Commons will have a significantly higher proportion of females.</p><p>I know that, at a local level, many of us will have the same experience of community groups or resident associations.  When there is an issue in our local constituencies, it is often women who garner people together and are the drivers and force behind getting action taken in their local communities.  It leads to this question:  why are those women not putting themselves forward for their local council or, indeed, for the Assembly?  Clearly there is an issue there, in that the electorate will pick who they want to represent them, but parties, too, have a responsibility in putting their candidates forward.</p><p>I know that it is not in the Committee recommendations &#8212; I am glad that it is not &#8212; but, during the evidence sessions, a number of people talked about quotas.  I think that quotas can actually be a very dangerous thing if we want to have women who are empowered and put forward for election.  What that means is that women may be put forward for reasons other than merit.  I think that that actually does a disservice to females who want to come forward and stand for office,  Therefore, I am glad that that is not part of the Committee's recommendations.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Women in Politics and the Northern Ireland Assembly: Review Report"}], "title": "", "house": "3", "image": "/images/mpsL/13927.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2011-05-09 13:07:07", "image_width": 83, "person_id": "13927", "entered_reason": "election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Alastair Ross", "member_id": "90473", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "DUP", "constituency": "East Antrim"}, {"left_reason": "dissolution", "first_name": "Alastair", "last_name": "Ross", "left_house": "2011-03-24", "title": "", "house": "3", "image": "/images/mpsL/13927.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2011-03-28 17:40:16", "image_width": 83, "person_id": "13927", "entered_reason": "appointed", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Alastair Ross", "member_id": "90356", "entered_house": "2007-05-14", "party": "DUP", "constituency": "East Antrim"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Caitriona", "last_name": "Ruane", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>5.

Let me deal first with the issue of the exemption from fair employment.  When Jim Clarke from CCMS spoke to the Education Committee on 29 May 2013, he stated clearly that CCMS had never used the exemption and had no intention of using it.  He went even further when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have no qualms whatsoever about that being taken away.\"</p><p>I would also be in favour of the exemption being removed, even though it appears it has never been used.  How do we do that?  We do it by bringing forward a single equality Bill that covers all the remaining outstanding equality issues.  I look forward to the party that proposed this motion and those that support it also giving their support to a single equality Bill.</p><p>Let me move on to the issue of the certificate in religious education.  The motion states that the requirement for the certificate in primary and nursery schools in the Catholic sector is a barrier to \"truly shared education\".  I do not know whether \"truly shared\" is different from shared, but maybe somebody can explain that later.</p><p>The report from the ministerial advisory group, in March 2013, used a definition of shared education stating that it:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Involves schools ... of differing ownership, sectoral identity and ethos, management type or governance arrangements\".</p><p>From that definition, it follows that a shared approach accepts the diversity and distinctiveness of our school system and our society.  It respects all types of schools, including controlled, Catholic, integrated and Irish-medium.</p><p>The certificate is a requirement in Catholic primary and nursery schools, aimed at protecting the Catholic ethos in those schools.  No one would expect the integrated or Irish-medium sectors to abandon policies or practices aimed at protecting the ethos of those particular sectors, so why are the proposers of this motion and amendment seeking to undermine the integrity of one particular sector?  On the face of it, this is a long way removed from the respectful spirit that we require for shared education.</p><p>Let me make the point that the certificate is a qualification just like any other, whether it be maths, English and so on.  We all know that the teachers in primary schools teach the full curriculum, and they need to be versed in the religious education that they are teaching in the classroom.  The Catholic sector wants to protect that ethos in their schools.  What is the difficulty with that?  What is the difficulty that the proposers of this motion and amendment have with diversity in the system?  Are we going back to a situation similar to that which we recently had with the debacle over St Mary's, when the Minister for Employment and Learning &#8212; an Alliance Minister &#8212; was trying to force the integration of teacher training?</p><p>The respectful spirit required for shared education was absent from the Minister for Employment and Learning's recent attempts to undermine St Mary's University College by financial coercion.  I know that St Mary's is committed to a shared future for teacher training based on respect for diversity and parity of esteem.  In fact, on 17 September last year, the principal of St Mary's, Peter Finn, told the Committee for Employment and Learning that the issue of the religious education certificate could be resolved by collaboration.  I am sure that, when there is evidence of a genuine desire for collaboration, St Mary's will not be found wanting.</p><p>Forced integration is not the answer, and the Alliance Party, by its recent actions and its amendment to the motion today, creates an atmosphere of distrust.  All of us sitting over here believe that this is aimed solely at the Catholic sector.  The potential for progress has been set back.  We will oppose the motion and the amendment.

I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate today.  As has been stated, the current arrangements date back to 1986, albeit that there have been some changes in the intervening period.  It is well past the time for us to introduce a legislative framework that is fit for purpose for the 21st century.  This Bill gives us the opportunity to build that framework and to deal with the increasing number of children with special needs.  Today we have heard chapter and verse about the vast increase in the number of children being diagnosed with special educational needs, and that is something that the legislation has to take account of.</p><p>The rising number of children with special needs has been accompanied by delays in carrying out assessments, and I, for one, welcome the commitment of the Minister and the parts of the legislation that will lead to a reduction of the period for assessment from 26 weeks to 20 weeks.  I hope that 20 weeks is going to be the upper limit, rather than a minimum period, in which assessments can be carried out on those children who have special needs.</p><p>It is vital that schools &#8212; I include the boards of governors in that &#8212; and the Education Authority are clear about their responsibilities.  Hopefully, this Bill will also bring about clarity in that regard.</p><p>While over 5,000 children with very complex special educational needs are in special schools, the overwhelming majority are in mainstream schools.  The challenge facing us, as legislators, is first to ensure that children with SEN are provided with the best possible learning environment.  It may be that some children with particularly complex needs need a bespoke environment, but, for the vast majority, mainstream schools will be the environment in which they go through the education system.  In that light, schools must be welcoming, diverse and provide for the challenges presented by having an inclusive system, so that children are not discriminated against and, just as importantly, that there is no perception that children with special needs are discriminated against within our education system.</p><p>I welcome the duty that the Bill places on boards of governors, including the requirement for a personal learning plan for each child on the school's SEN register.</p><p>One of the good things about speaking towards the end of a debate is that most of what you planned to say has been said.  I will conclude by welcoming the legislation.

As Deputy Chairperson of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee, I move the motion on the day following International Women&#8217;s Day, which makes this debate more poignant.</p><p>The purpose of this debate is to approve the report, 'Women in Politics and the Northern Ireland Assembly', but, on this auspicious occasion, it is also an opportunity for the Assembly, political parties and the Executive to commit to turning the recommendations made in this report into meaningful actions that will address the lack of women in politics here in the North.</p><p>I will put in context why the Assembly and Executive Review Committee agreed to review this topic.  In 2013, following a review of the responses received from political parties, the Committee commissioned a paper from the Assembly's Research and Information Service on one of the topics identified, entitled \"Women in Politics\".  The paper summarised the background to women&#8217;s representation or, more specifically, under-representation in politics here in the North.  The stark facts outlined in the paper were enough for the Committee to consider prioritising this issue as its next review.  With only 21 females out of 108 elected representatives in the Assembly, the North has one of the lowest levels of female representation of devolved and national legislatures in the UK and Ireland.  If placed in international legislatures, the Assembly would rank 70th out of 189 countries.</p><p>In June 2014, the Committee agreed the terms of reference for the review and agreed to analyse barriers and challenges facing women seeking to enter political life, examine the potential of existing initiatives, explore the merits of positive action and, finally, provide recommendations and conclusions.  The Committee listened to evidence on this issue from leading academics, representatives from the women&#8217;s sector and a former Deputy Speaker of this House.  The Committee received 20 substantial responses to the written call for evidence, including from academia, trade unions and the women's and youth sectors.  Finally, 60 key stakeholders attended a round-table event in October 2014, which was opened by the two junior Ministers, Minister McCann and Minister Bell.  I would like to take this opportunity to express the Committee&#8217;s appreciation to all those who contributed to the inquiry.</p><p>While encountering a wealth of knowledge within the North, it was important for the Committee to experience how other legislatures had approached increasing women&#8217;s participation in politics and the Committee undertook a fact-finding visit to the National Assembly for Wales.  During its visit, the Committee was able to explore how the National Assembly for Wales managed to maintain 42% of women Assembly Members.  The Committee considered the impact of an initiative developed by the Presiding Officer for the National Assembly for Wales, Dame Rosemary Butler, in order to encourage more women into public life for the 2016 elections.  Members were able to discuss future plans of the National Assembly for Wales in increasing women&#8217;s participation in politics as well as taking evidence from academics and those who delivered the public life initiative.</p><p>The Committee was aware of the four Nordic countries that have consistently held the highest positions of gender equality in the world.  One of those countries, Iceland, was considered a country to visit as the Icelandic Government have taken systematic steps to introduce and promote gender equality in all areas of society.  One third of current Ministers are female and, in the Parliament, women hold nearly 40% of parliamentary seats.  Iceland has had special legislation intended to ensure equality between women and men since 1976.  The Icelandic Government and political parties have introduced a number of key actions to increase women&#8217;s participation in the political, social and economic life of the country.</p><p>While undertaking the review, the Committee was made aware of a number of programmes, policies and strategies undertaken by the Assembly, political parties and Departments.  It was apparent that, in order to increase women in politics, a more holistic approach across the Assembly, political parties and Departments is required.</p><p>The final report has made a series of recommendations for the Assembly, political parties and the Executive to assist women into politics and support our existing female politicians.  Here are three of the recommendations demonstrating what would have a positive impact on addressing the barriers for women.  The Assembly needs to establish a working group, made up of elected women and men, who will monitor and promote measures to ensure that the Assembly becomes a gender-sensitive Parliament.  While no consensus was reached on mandatory quotas or financial penalties, many other recommendations to political parties, if adopted, could have a major impact.  For example, given the vital role that the media can play in telling us more about the views of women in political life, parties should ensure that their internal media strategies give women greater visibility.  Time and time again, childcare was named as one of the main barriers to women.  A childcare strategy for the North needs to be a priority, as that issue will remain a challenge for women considering a political career.</p><p>I take this opportunity to thank both the previous and present Speakers for their letters to the Assembly and Executive Review Committee supporting and encouraging more women into politics and committing to be mindful in the conduct of the Speaker&#8217;s responsibilities.</p><p>Finally, I would like to end by drawing attention to how the Assembly and Executive Review Committee reached consensus on all of the 29 recommendations; a clear indication as to how increasing women in politics should be a priority for political parties, the Executive and the Assembly.  The Assembly and Executive Review Committee now requests that the Assembly approves the Committee&#8217;s report.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Women in Politics and the Northern Ireland Assembly: Review Report"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>Will the Member give way?</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: McCreesh Park"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>The Member, like me, knew Raymond McCreesh; we knew him to be a man of honour, integrity and immense courage.

The Committee agreed that the duties for Members set out in Standing Order 69 should be extended to the Attorney General and that the Northern Ireland Assembly Commissioner for Standards should be able to investigate an alleged breach of any duty by the Attorney General in respect of Members' interests.  The Committee agreed that it should be able to decide whether to uphold a complaint in respect of the Attorney General and, where it upheld a complaint, it would recommend to the Assembly the imposition of a sanction.</p><p>On sanctions, the Committee said that Standing Orders should include provisions for excluding the Attorney General from proceedings of the Assembly if he failed to comply with any of these duties or for withdrawing his rights and privileges for the period of his exclusion.  The Committee noted that, however, compared with Members, there were fewer rights and privileges that could be withdrawn during such an exclusion, for example, the right to salary and allowances.  The Committee on Procedures has addressed these points in its report.</p><p>The Committee on Standards and Privileges is concluding its review of the Assembly's code of conduct.

I speak on a personal basis, given that my father has had to avail himself of the services of the Causeway Hospital for the last three weeks, following a small heart attack.  I know that I speak with my father's endorsement when I say that the care that he has received, not only in the Causeway, but in Altnagelvin for a short time &#8212; Mr Dallat made reference to the working relationship between the two hospitals &#8212; was exemplary.  Certainly, on a personal basis, as a family, we have nothing but the highest praise for the provision in the Causeway Hospital.</p><p>Comment has been made about where we were and concerns and fears.  Let us be quite blunt and honest:  some of those concerns were hyped up by politicians, who, for their own ends, wanted to use an issue such as the Causeway Hospital for cheap political point scoring.  I am glad that what we have heard so far has been not been in that vein, having heard scare stories in the past that the hospital was closing and coming to an end.</p><p>Let us remember that I come from a town that knows what it is like to lose a hospital.  The Causeway Hospital came into existence as a result of the closure of the Route.  It took a long time for the people in my part of the North Antrim constituency to become accustomed to the fact that the new hospital was down the road in Coleraine, but they now look upon it as their local hospital and have bought into it.  Just the other day, I called into see Dr John Robb, someone we all have known for many years.</p><p>He expressed his appreciation of the fact that, after all the years of transition from the Route to the Causeway, people have bought into the Causeway Hospital as their local service.  We need to give Fred Mullan and his staff credit; some comments were made about the staff.  Fred Mullan has done an exceptional job since taking up his post and needs to be given all possible support.</p><p>The Minister will probably have something to say about this, but let us remember that Simon Stevens, who took up the position of chief executive of the NHS in England in April, said that small hospitals were vital in meeting the needs of an ageing population and would provide focus for the community services that have become \"too complicated and too fragmented\".  In many respects, that is a reflection of what we see being provided at the Causeway.</p><p>The trust has a responsibility to ensure that its sets out its vision for services in the entire area.  Despite all that we can say that is positive &#8212; there is a lot to be said that is positive &#8212; there is still a concern about what happens between the Causeway and the Antrim Area Hospital sites.  There is a tension there, and you only have to speak to staff to realise that there is sometimes that concern.</p><p>I look forward to the trust setting out its vision in what I trust will be a very short time.  Politicians can then collectively give their support to ensuring that we continue to see the provision of services such as A&amp;E.  I have been lobbying the trust for some time to provide dialysis services in the Causeway, and I welcome the fact that it is now considering the provision of those services very seriously.  That will bring its own challenges and opportunities.  We have to look a bit wider at what a service can bring to an area and the implications that it could have, and I am well aware that the provision of dialysis services would raise concerns about the number of medical beds.</p><p>I had a very productive meeting with Dr Tony Stevens and with Valerie Watts.  We need to keep our focus very clearly on the provision of services.  At the heart of it is the community that the hospital serves.</p><p>I commend the Member for securing the debate.  Let us collectively, as politicians, work with the Minister, the trust and the board to ensure that the Causeway Hospital continues to provide for our community in the way that it has done.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>The Member makes a valid point.  Post-2016, we will have nine new Departments, all of which will have been enhanced and enlarged and have taken on considerably different responsibilities and emphases and new roles, but I still believe that the Committees that would then be created to mirror the nine Departments need to be able to continue the work that has been done.  I do not think that any Member in this House questions the validity and the value of the work that is carried out by existing Committees.  It is one of the best elements in what goes on here.  A lot of work is done by our Committees that sometimes does not get the credit it deserves.  If you start to do a trawl of the Committees in this House, you would see the extensive work that they do.  I do not believe that by creating some other subset &#8212; of course there is, maybe, one way that it could be done.  If the Committee for Communities or whatever new Committee is established, were to decide to establish an ad hoc Committee, as it did for the Welfare Reform Bill, then that would be up to that Committee, but I believe that that is there responsibility and duty to hold me, as Minister for Social Development, and whoever is the Minister for Communities in 2016 to account.</p><p>I move on to comments made by Mr McCarthy.  I recognise that, unfortunately, some Members who contribute to the Social Development Committee have other duties and cannot be with us.  I appreciate that he was speaking on behalf of his colleague.  He made reference to the issues that were raised about the bereavement support payment, and, as I said in response to the Chair, we are considering the recommendations that flowed from the Committee's report, and we will be, very soon I trust, in a position to respond, at which point Members will be able to see the detail of that response.</p><p>He also made reference to the question of the 35 qualifying years.  It might be useful to give some context to that issue.  We are merging the two schemes; the 30 qualifying years required for the full basic state pension and up to 52 years for the state second pension.  It strikes a balance between enabling the majority of people who contribute to achieve a full state pension and retaining the contributory principle.  It avoids the unnecessary complexity of a phased approach in which the value of the new state pension qualifying years could differ from the different cohorts.</p><p>By the mid-2030s, 80% of people reaching state pension age will get the full new state pension.  In 2020, around 90% of males and 80% of females under the new state pension will have 35 or more qualifying years.  This is true both at state pension age in 2020 and for all pensioners under the new state pension in 2020, so no one will be disadvantaged by the increase to the 35 years.  Under the current scheme, 30 qualifying years provides a full state pension entitlement of &#163;115&#183;95 from April 2015.  Under the new scheme, 30 qualifying years will provide a state pension entitlement of &#163;129&#183;64.  I trust that that helps Members and places that on the record.</p><p>Those are all the comments that I want to make about the matters that have been raised by Members.  I thank Members for their help and indulgence and I also want to place on record my appreciation of my officials for the work that they have done, particularly for the extensive work that they did &#8212; it was mentioned by the Chair of the Committee for Social Development &#8212; when the Bill was being considered at Committee Stage.

Of course, I can confirm that this is a parity measure, and it is a matter that has been addressed.

He referred to amendment No 6, but it actually is in reference to amendment No 2.  It may have been that it has subsequently changed.  What does amendment No 2 do?  It inserts a paragraph into schedule 12 to the Pensions Bill, which deals with amendments consequential on the introduction of the new state pension.  The new paragraph will amend clause 97(8) of the Welfare Reform Bill to provide that the new state pension cannot be caught by the benefits cap.  This continues the agreed policy that the state pension cannot be included in the benefits cap.

Now it is the case that we have an impending Tory Government, and all is going to come to an end.  There is no doubt that, irrespective of the outcome of the general election, we will continue to face challenges in the weeks, months and years ahead.

Amendment Nos 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are in consequence of the Pension Schemes Act 2015, which received Royal Assent on 3 March 2015.  Members may recall that, on 26 January, the House agreed a legislative consent motion relating to the provisions of the then Westminster Pension Schemes Bill, including provisions in schedule 4 to the Bill relating to rights to transfer benefits. Schedule 4 to the new Pension Schemes Act makes consequential amendments to the Pensions Act 2014 and includes references to it in other legislation.</p><p>The Pensions Act 2014 is the Westminster equivalent of the Pensions Bill.  As our Pensions Bill has not completed its passage through the Assembly, schedule 4 to the Pension Schemes Act 2015 could not make corresponding amendments for Northern Ireland.  Amendment Nos 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 make the necessary amendments.  They do not denote new policy and, in line with the legislative consent motion, would have been carried in the Pension Schemes Act 2015 had the Pensions Bill been enacted.</p><p>Briefly, amendment No 1 updates a legislative reference.  Amendment Nos 3 and 4 replace references to \"applicable rules\" with references to \"scheme rules\" as, following changes made by the Pension Schemes Act 2015, the term \"applicable rules\" is no longer used and is subsumed within the definition of \"scheme rules\" in section 96B of the Pension Schemes (Northern Ireland) Act 1993, as inserted by the Pension Schemes Act 2015.  The definition of scheme rules in section 96B provides that references to scheme rules refer to the rules of the scheme except in so far as they are overridden by a relevant legislative provision.  Scheme rules also include any relevant legislative provision not included in the scheme rules.  I am sure that Members are following all that intensely.  I am just checking that everybody is doing that.</p><p>The effect of amendment Nos 5 and 6 is to include provisions of schedules 17 and 18 to the Bill in the list of relevant legislative provisions in the definition of scheme rules in section 96B of the Pension Schemes (Northern Ireland) Act 1993.</p><p>I turn briefly to amendment No 2. It amends the Welfare Reform Bill to ensure that the agreed policy that the benefit cap should not apply to state pension continues when the new state pension scheme comes into operation.</p><p>In conclusion, I merely restate that these are minor technical and consequential amendments.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Pensions Bill: Consideration Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>I beg to move</p><p class=\"italic\">That the Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers' Compensation) (Payment of Claims) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015 be affirmed.</p><p>These regulations are made under the Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers&#8217; Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 and increase the compensation payable under that order to those suffering from certain dust-related diseases and to their dependants.  I will outline briefly the purpose of the scheme established by the Order, which covers five respiratory diseases, most of which are directly related to asbestos exposure:  mesothelioma, diffuse pleural thickening, primary carcinoma of the lung, byssinosis and pneumoconiosis, which includes asbestosis.</p><p>People suffering from an industrial disease can sue their employer if the disease was contracted as a result of working for that employer.  However, in some cases it has taken years to develop symptoms of the diseases covered by the Order, and diagnosis may not be until decades after exposure to the dust.  Given the long time frame involved, it is possible that employers responsible may no longer exist, and consequently sufferers and their dependants can experience great difficulty in obtaining compensation.</p><p>The scheme, which was introduced in 1979, provides a lump sum payment for sufferers who are unable to pursue employers through the courts as those employers are no longer in business.  To receive payment under the Order, there must be no relevant employer who can be sued and court action must not have been brought, or compensation received, in respect of any of the diseases for which the person is claiming.  In order to receive a payment, a person must have been awarded industrial injuries disablement benefit.  The lump sum payment under the Order is in addition to the weekly industrial injuries disablement benefit that is paid in relation to the same disease.  A claim can also be made by dependants after the death of the sufferer.</p><p>The lump sum payment is based on the age of the sufferer and the level of disability, with higher amounts paid to people with higher levels of disability and whose disability arises at an early age.  Lower amounts are payable to dependants who make a claim after the sufferer has died.  The regulations increase the amounts payable under the order by 1&#183;2% in line with this year&#8217;s uprating of industrial injuries benefits and they ensure that payments are the same as those in the corresponding scheme operating in Great Britain.  The maximum amount that can be paid under the scheme is increased to &#163;86,607 for a person aged 37, or under, at diagnosis and will ensure that compensation provided under the Order maintains its value.</p><p>I am sure that we all agree that no amount of money can ever compensate individuals and families for the suffering and loss caused by these terrible diseases.  I am also sure that Members across the Assembly will support the regulations to ensure that those who make a claim on or after 1 April 2015 will receive the higher amounts.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers' Compensation) (Payment of Claims) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>I thank the House for the consensus of support for the regulations.

The amounts payable are to be increased in line with the corresponding scheme operating in England, Scotland and Wales.</p><p>I will briefly outline the purpose of the scheme.  The mesothelioma scheme provides financial support within a matter of weeks of diagnosis without the need to establish an occupational link or, indeed, any causal link.  Many people who were previously not eligible for help &#8212; for example, those who are unable to pursue a civil claim or to claim a lump sum under the Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers' Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 &#8212; have access to financial help for that terrible disease through the scheme.  That means that sufferers of mesothelioma are eligible for a payment whether they were employees, were self-employed or, indeed, have never worked, provided that they have not already received a compensation payment from another source.</p><p>The regulations will increase the amounts payable under the mesothelioma scheme by 1&#183;2%, in line with this year's uprating of industrial injuries benefits from April 2015.  For example, the amount payable to a person aged 37 or under at diagnosis will be increased from &#163;83,330 to &#163;86,607, which is the same maximum that can be paid from April 2015 under the pneumoconiosis scheme.

Having reflected on the contributions in Hansard from then, I can say that progress is being made at the Causeway Hospital.  At that time, the tenor of the debate was very much around the future of accident and emergency services.</p><p>As has already been referred to, it is the large geographical area and the populace that the Causeway Hospital services that makes it unique among our hospitals, as well as the fact that the new council area &#8212; Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council &#8212; has one of the highest levels of elderly and retired people living in it.  Mr Campbell referred to the 70% increase in people to be serviced by the hospital as a result of the influx during the summer months.  As Mr McQuillan said in the debate two years ago, that hospital is vital for the sustainability of the air show and the North West 200, two highly dangerous sporting events, which could be put in jeopardy should that level of service and support not be there.  That is seasonal, but it is not as if everybody disappears during the winter months because that is when the large student population comes into the area, and they need looking after as well.</p><p>The basis for Mr Dallat bringing this Adjournment debate are the concerns that are being raised locally by staff, hospital users and the general populous.  What is coming down the road, and what is the future of the Causeway Hospital through Transforming Your Care or the Donaldson report?  That is what is adding to the local disquiet.  Encapsulated in that is the Northern Trust's model of service, which seems to be based on an acute service in Coleraine, with A&amp;E solely facilitated there, and the threat that would pose to the Causeway.</p><p>I welcome the recent appointments of senior clinicians to the Causeway, which have started to give a little bit of reassurance and security to the rest of the staff.  I would like reassurance from the Minister that that is a continual path of development, involving the retention and expansion of the services that are already there.  We see a contradiction in some of the Northern Trust's policies, which is why we are looking for that reassurance.  Dalriada Hospital, which is used as a step-down facility to the Causeway, being under threat adds to the general unease in the local area.  We really need that reassurance.</p><p>I have heard Members comment on the great service we get from the staff but, from the user's point of view, there still seem to be increasing pressures on A&amp;E at times, when it has to close and patients are diverted.  So, I would really like reassurance from the Minister that there can be some kind of review of provision to make sure that A&amp;E is adequately provided for, as well as other departments in the hospital.  What the Causeway needs at this time is certainty, and it is the Minister who can provide that certainty and give the staff of the Causeway, people who use it and the general populous around area that reassurance.  I hope the Minister can provide that certainty in his summing up today.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for his response to the debate on the motion and the amendment.  The motions calls on the Assembly to reaffirm:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"its rejection of the imposition of water rates on the people of Northern Ireland\".</p><p>We have no problem with doing that; we have made commitments to that effect many times.  We questioned the timing of the debate, but I was glad that Trevor Clarke, in his opening comments, made clear that it was not to score points against the Minister.  Unfortunately, the Alliance Party could not say the same.</p><p>The Minister has made a continuing commitment to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland are not hit with an extra bill for implementing domestic water charges through the ongoing subsidy that his Department pays to Northern Ireland Water in lieu of charges.  We sought to amend the motion because other parties at the Executive table seem content to claim the victory for deferring water charges but want none of the responsibility for ensuring that the responsible Department is adequately resourced to maintain the water infrastructure.  We welcome the cross-party support that we have received today.</p><p>The Minister, in his response, highlighted how his Department will face &#163;60 million of pressures next year.  Recently, he has warned of the consequences that that would have for core services, but he faces continued criticism from all parties for doing so.  The Ulster Unionist Party has continually opposed introducing domestic water charges.  As was reiterated by my party colleague Leslie Cree, we do not believe that it would be fair to lump another bill on our society when many are finding themselves stretched almost to breaking point.  Our amendment is reasonable; if the Executive agree to defer something that has implications for public spend, it should be fairly straightforward that they work with the Minister responsible to ensure that that commitment is taken into account and an adequate allocation is made to that Department.</p><p>In response to a comment from, I think, Mr Lyttle, Danny Kennedy has, during his time as Minister for Regional Development, sought to create space to allow for constructive conversations and debate to take place about the future governance of water in Northern Ireland.  Most Members who spoke reiterated the point that our water infrastructure has been the victim of underinvestment; something that has been the case for decades.  While Danny Kennedy has committed to paying the subsidy to Northern Ireland Water, it is important that it does not become complacent.  Like us all, it should always be striving to do better, maintaining high levels of water quality, improving customer service and ensuring that our environment is protected through adequate waste water treatment.</p><p>I want to respond to some comments that were made during the debate.  Mr Lyttle challenged the DUP about the deliberate misrepresentation that he thought was being levelled at the Alliance Party.  Stewart Dickson made an intervention in regard to the Ulster Unionist Party's position when my party colleague Leslie Cree was making his contribution.  We should be careful about making accusations about deliberate misrepresentation.  John Dallat from the SDLP said that people should not pay twice for water and that we should avoid making the debate party political.  On a positive note, he highlighted the faults of the previous Sinn F&#233;in Minister and how he had spent &#163;1 million on the installation of water meters, so he kept party politics out of the process altogether.</p><p>John McCallister spoke about being exhausted.  As the Minister highlighted, we are all pretty exhausted with what seems to be John's single transferable speech on nearly any subject that is brought before the House.</p><p>I am glad that most parties have indicated their support for our amendment.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>No, I am finished.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>T2.

The Committee has been very active in assessing the legislative impact of Europe, as well as the important funding and employment opportunities it offers.</p><p>At its meeting on 18 February, the Committee agreed its European priorities for 2015.  The Committee continues to monitor the labour mobility package, which aims to support labour mobility and tackle issues by means of the better coordination of social security systems, the targeted review of the posting of workers directive and an enhanced EURES.  This issue has been a Committee priority since 2014.

In 2014, the Committee showed a keen interest in job creation in the green economy and the possible job opportunities for Northern Ireland if the Department coul;d ensure that the right skills were available in the local labour market.  The Committee has requested that it be updated on all these issues.</p><p>As the Department has responsibility for the management of the European social fund (ESF) in Northern Ireland, the Committee has continued its scrutiny of the matter and has been briefed on numerous occasions by the Minister and departmental officials on issues arising from the ESF funding application process, which was brought to the Committee&#8217;s attention by the community and voluntary sector.  The Committee has been made aware of a complaint lodged by the Commission regarding the Department's handling of the application process, and we will receive a further update on 15 March, when all the appeals processes in the ESF application funding process have been completed.</p><p>The Committee will consider any European Union memorandums identified by Assembly's Research and Information Service as relevant to the Committee and will consult the Department on what action it will take in relation to these.  The Committee will continue with its European Commission scrutiny in 2015, which will include biannual briefings from the Department and the Assembly's Research and Information Service on EU issues.

As highlighted by all Members so far, there is a wealth of statistics in this, which shows the significance of the problem.  It has been highlighted and already mentioned by others that, in the Civil Service as a whole, you are talking about &#163;30 million of a direct cost.  There are very significant indications, particularly in health and education, of &#163;73 million in health and &#163;46 million in education.  As regards those two specific areas, it is not surprising that the figures are high, given the size of those sections of the public sector, but the depth of them should concern us.</p><p>Very specifically as regards health and education, there are a number of recommendations in the report.  I think that it is important to draw the attention of the Health Department and the Education Department &#8212; and the respective Committees &#8212; to those aspects of the report because this is not something for DFP or even the Executive as a whole; it burrows into a number of Departments.  Beyond the sheer statistics, mention has been made of the direct potential savings if we simply move to a situation in which we are brought into line with the rest of the United Kingdom.</p><p>As I think has been mentioned by a number of Members, there are intangible benefits to reducing the level of sickness and, indeed, intangible problems are created.  It is not simply the cost and the lack of productivity.  The danger with high levels of sickness absence is that it becomes a vicious circle.  Indeed, it places an additional strain on those workers who are left to cover the work of absent colleagues in whatever Department or section, and that, in turn, can lead to sickness absences from them.</p><p>Mr Nesbitt and others were correct to focus on mental health, as, for many years, it has been the Cinderella service.  We have all seen that, and not just through sickness absences.  Any of us who are involved in tribunals can see the doctor's report of someone who has massive difficulty with movement in their back or can see someone sitting with a broken leg covered in plaster, and that is all very visible.  However, mental health is a lot more intangible and the symptoms are a lot less obvious, but they are altogether very real.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that, while there is a problem, the report highlights the good work that has been done on this, particularly by the Minister and his predecessor.  We have seen the intervention in the creation of the WELL programme, which, while still in its infancy, has led to 170 trained champions throughout the Civil Service.  We have seen other interventions, particularly through face-to-face contacts, interviews and wider events such as No Smoking Day, which can all have an impact on health.  As a result, we have seen a decline in sickness absence.  That has helped to focus on short-term illness.  However, that may have a long-term impact because there is a danger that, if you create a culture where there are short-term absences, it can lead to that.</p><p>There is no doubt that the thrust of the report looks at long-term illnesses, and that has a major impact on the Civil Service and on the public service as a whole.  A wise person learns from their mistakes; an even wiser person learns from someone else's mistakes.  The report highlighted the studies done by the City of London Corporation and HMRC, which has been able to reduce its sickness absence considerably.  At times, some of us may not necessarily see a reduction in sickness absences in HMRC as the best thing.  Nevertheless, it has been very successful in reducing absences, and there are clear lessons to be learned.</p><p>Good work has been done in DFP, and the report highlights the need to ensure that what is happening in DFP, and some of the pilot programmes that have begun there, is rolled out across the Civil Service.  It is important to have a joined-up approach.  The Chair of the OFMDFM Committee indicated that they had been successful in OFMDFM.  Success has been somewhat patchy across Departments, and it is important to get joined-up thinking and success.</p><p>The report contains recommendations that need to be adopted and carefully studied.  For all our sakes, particularly as we move into an era in which the size of the public sector is likely to be smaller &#8212; the number of staff is likely to be smaller &#8212; that will become a necessity rather than an advantage.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Sickness Absence in the Northern Ireland Public Sector"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>6.

I am not aware of the detail of the breakdown, because some of that may come under individual salaries.  What is clear is the amount each party receives.  He indicated that, for instance, my party receives about &#163;200,000 via the two different elements.  That will be reduced as a result of this today by 3%, a loss of about &#163;6,000.  We have, from the Whip's point of view, 38 Members to manage.  The Whip's office for the TUV manages one Member, who, I appreciate, may at times be a little unmanageable, but does not require a member of staff to do that.  Speaking with a DUP hat on, the financing of political parties equates to about &#163;5,000 per Member.  I note, for example, that the TUV will receive &#163;25,600 per Member.  \"Physician, heal thyself\", before challenging or criticising someone else from the high moral ground.</p><p>What we have, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a reasonable approach in the circumstances.  We are living under a straitened financial burden, which means the Assembly has had to cut &#163;2 million.  We were able to, at least by way of majority position and, I think, on all issues eventually, reach a situation that enables us to live within budget, despite the challenges.  We should remember that, if there are any redundancies arising out of the FAPP scheme, there is not the opportunity for voluntary exit, or, indeed, any form of package for anyone.  That needs to be borne in mind.  But it is right that the political parties also bear a share of that overall burden.  Consequently, I believe that the 3% cut was seen as a reasonable approach by the majority of Commission members.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the motion to the Assembly as an important element in assisting the Commission to live within its reduced budget.</p><p class=\"italic\">Question put and agreed to.\n\nResolved:</p><p class=\"italic\">That, as set out in section 2(4) of the Financial Assistance for Political Parties Act (Northern Ireland) 2000, this Assembly approves the revised scheme NIA 241/11-16 laid before the Assembly on 20 March 2015 for payments to political parties for the purpose of assisting Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly who are connected with such parties to perform their Assembly duties.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Assembly Business: Financial Assistance for Political Parties Scheme 2015"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>I thank Members for their contributions in what has been, perhaps, a livelier debate than some of us may have anticipated.  I am grateful that, whatever the divergence between Members, there at least seems to be a level of consensus that it is a necessary part of the overall package.</p><p>As Members indicated, there was a range of views within this, and there were those who would advocate no change and those who would advocate a 10% change.  What we are left with, as part of an overall package for the Assembly, is a 3% cut.</p><p>It should be remembered that the FAPP scheme has effectively had amounts frozen since 2010, which means, from a practical point of view, that the money largely goes to pay for salaries.  Unlike others where there may be, for the public service, some level of increment each year, it will mean that members of staff are left more or less on the same wage for a number of years.  That is the implication from an adverse-impact point of view.</p><p>We have a situation where some of the staff who are paid under the FAPP scheme do not have the same rights and entitlements as some other staff in the Assembly or, indeed, as MLAs.  What we have here is a contribution to the overall financial situation.  It was one, as was indicated, that seemed to have been well discussed and well thought through and, indeed, was evidence-based.  I would highlight that concerns have been raised, by the proposer and by Mr Ramsey, in relation to determination and non-determination of the independent panel where, on the one hand &#8212; apparently without a great deal of research &#8212; it rejected a potential saving, and on other occasions seems, somewhat perversely, to have put in place something that will penalise those who do the most in relation to correspondence and that sort of thing.  This is, at least, sensibly based.</p><p>I turn to a couple of the issues.  A case was made for a 10% cut.  Obviously, the burden of any difference will have to be borne largely by parties.  It is, I think, fair to say that, for some parties, a 3% cut may be reasonably challenging.  Others could very easily afford a 10% cut, but then we are not all in the position in this Chamber of being one of the richest parties in western Europe.  Indeed, a few additional plates in New York may be enough to pay for a 10% cut.  That option is not necessarily available for all of us.</p><p>Mention has been made of the FAPP scheme by the Member for North Antrim Mr Allister.  Any money claimed under the FAPP scheme has to be used for party purposes in relation to the Assembly.  Everything is receipted and directly accounted for.  Indeed, there is an independent audit, which I understand is taking place at the moment.

A single equality Bill might be not just one Trojan Horse but a stable full to expand the law.  That is why we have degrees of reservations.</p><p>Mr Attwood, on behalf of the SDLP, referring to our amendment, said that he did not really trust our motives.  I am reminded of Queen Elizabeth I's declaration that she did not wish to make \"windows into men's souls\".

It seems to me slightly ridiculous not to allow a proper debate through such a veto.    \n<BR/>It may be that we are simply saying that there is not a precise solution that people can agree to.  One thing has to be acknowledged, and a number of Members mentioned the remarks of Baroness Hale, the position of the Council of Europe and the survey published just this week by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.  Many Christians in the United Kingdom feel strongly that it is a cold house in which they are being cold-shouldered.  When I look at human rights and equality issues, I am reminded of Orwell's 'Animal Farm', where:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"</p><p>We are in danger of encompassing human rights and equality, but doing so in a hierarchy that leaves out those of faith and those from a Christian background.</p><p>I welcome the fact that there seems to have been at least some level of acknowledgement from around the Chamber that there are serious issues to be debated.  If Mr Given's Bill is not precisely the way that people would want, let us at least have that much wider debate.

A key element of that team's work was a series of service reviews, including the networking of clinical services and the development of a new model for medical leadership and management.</p><p>I remind Members that I was up in Londonderry last week, where I inspected the new cath labs that have been installed.  They are absolutely state of the art &#8212; the most modern on the island of Ireland and in the United Kingdom.  The people of the Causeway area have access to those.  Indeed, while I was there, there was a patient from Coleraine and a patient from Castlerock, both in the Northern Trust area, being treated by that outstanding technology.  That shows the advantage of sharing services with Altnagelvin.  In both cases, within the hour, the patient had been transported from the scene of their cardiac arrest to the cath labs and treated in a very effective way.  That shows that the new links with Altnagelvin are bearing fruit.  Now, it would not be possible to have a cath lab at the Causeway in Coleraine or, indeed, at any smaller hospital in Northern Ireland, but it is good that we have hypothecated that service for not only the Western Trust but a very large section of the Northern Trust.</p><p>It is important that the work of the turnaround and support team be substantially implemented before further work is carried out on the options appraisal on future management arrangements.  When the recommendations from the team have been implemented, the focus can once again turn to the appraisal of the management options recommended by Transforming Your Care.</p><p>Donaldson is out for consultation.  The points that have been made today should be made to Donaldson.  Mr Storey has just made a point of handing me 'Causeway's Future: Proposals for the Way Forward for Causeway Hospital', which was prepared by the Causeway Hospital Campaign group.  Those are all the sorts of points that the Donaldson review wants to hear.  We are not wedded to any particular recommendation of Donaldson, but I was enthusiastic, because Donaldson has caused us to stop and think on many issues about where we are going in Northern Ireland and how, in many ways, we can configure our services.  It has prompted the debate that we need to have.  There are MLAs and MPs who see a very bright future for the Causeway Hospital through documents such as this.  It is important that the review team has that information and can take it on board.</p><p>People who might cast aspersions on Liam Donaldson's track record have to remember that we are talking about the Sir Alex Ferguson of health.  This is an individual who was the Chief Medical Officer for England and has vast experience and an impeccable track record in this field.  When he makes recommendations, we should sit up and take note.  That does not mean that we slavishly follow everything that he says, but we have to give it due and careful consideration.

We can then have an intelligent debate on the best way in which to configure hospital services in Northern Ireland.</p><p>That is as far as I am prepared to go at this stage, but I hope that the huge investment we are making in the Causeway Hospital in staffing at the moment indicates how important a role we see it having in the north coast area.</p><p class=\"italic\">Adjourned at 5.05 pm.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>First of all, I thank Mr Dallat for his patience.  This debate was due to have been held last week, but because I was witnessing first-rate care in the Royal for my wife, I simply could not make it.  I am glad that the Assembly Business Office and, indeed, the Business Committee were able to facilitate his request to have the debate moved on a week.</p><p>As the Member for East Londonderry Mr Campbell said, I visited the Causeway Hospital at his request.  I have to say that that was in my capacity as Deputy Chairman of the Health Committee.  I was impressed by the large number of staff who arrived at the door to meet me and by the very detailed tour of the hospital that I had.  I was due to go back to the Causeway quite recently, but, again, because of the problems with my wife's health, I was not able to make it.  However, I commit to visiting the Causeway as soon as possible and to discuss some of the issues raised.</p><p>I know Fred Mullan very well.  He went to Queen's with me many years ago, and I have kept in touch with him about this issue.  I have found his input and that of all the Northern Trust's senior staff very helpful.  I thank Mr Dallat for raising the issue, and I take this opportunity to thank all the staff at the Causeway Hospital for their service to the local community and for their commitment to deliver high-quality health services.  I think that every Member who rose to speak during the debate made exactly the same point, which is that there is absolutely no problem with the standard of service that the people of the north coast are getting from that team.</p><p>The hospital is in one of the most beautiful scenic areas of Northern Ireland.  In fact, it is almost as scenic as south Down.  That was a joke, by the way, in case 'The Coleraine Chronicle' should happen to raise it in next week's edition.  The hospital provides services to the local population and the many visitors who come to enjoy the north coast's beaches, attractions and, of course, its world-class golf courses.  Such an area needs a vibrant hospital, and I am, therefore, committed to retaining the Causeway Hospital as a local acute hospital.  I hope that that allays Mr Allister's fears.</p><p>The model for services in the Causeway and the glens area will be based around an acute hospital in Coleraine, with an emergency Department, supporting clinical services, a well-developed intermediate care service and community teams evenly distributed across the area.  Of course, it is a very wide area.  Perhaps one of the most fortuitous aspects of local government reorganisation is that the new council area more or less fits very neatly the area the Causeway Hospital covers, going right out to Limavady at one extreme and right over to Moyle in the other.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>It is worth saying that Donaldson did not make any reference whatsoever to the Causeway Hospital.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>Yes.  He made a statement.  I am going to come back to it, because the Member raised a very crucial point about recommendation 1 of Donaldson.  I wish to deal with that, because several Members, including Claire Sugden, raised it, and I want to deal with it.</p><p>What I can say to you is that that is our position on the Causeway Hospital.  Donaldson is out to consultation, which ends on 22 May.  I am not going to pre-empt the public response to Donaldson on a whole range of issues.  Let me remind you that there was more than one recommendation in the Donaldson report.  Everybody has homed in on recommendation 1, to some extent ignoring the other nine recommendations, which are equally important.  I will come back to that, and I am sure that the Member will remind me if I do not.</p><p>There are partnership arrangements for the community and voluntary sector within the Causeway area.  That supports the integrated model of service.  The commitment to maintain acute services at the Causeway Hospital was clearly demonstrated in January this year, when the Northern Trust made new clinical appointments to the hospital.  Many people raised that issue.  Those are permanent appointments.</p><p>I want to come back to the concern about the lack of continuity of tenure.  I do not know where that is coming from; these are permanent salaried posts in the Causeway Hospital, including consultants in surgery, respiratory, obstetrics and gynaecology and a consultant physician in internal medicine.  They have been appointed and funded, and they are there on a permanent basis.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>Certainly.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>All appointments made in Northern Ireland are made to a trust rather than a specific hospital.  These posts were advertised, and it was made very clear to the applicants that they were for the Causeway.  They were in response to demands from many MLAs and the MP for the area for new permanent staff.  It is a huge commitment by the board and the trust to the Causeway that those have been made.  We are also making a joint appointment to a post with Altnagelvin hospital for a consultant cardiologist; that person is in the process of being recruited.  That gives us an indication.  On top of that, as Mr Campbell said, the trust is recruiting three further posts:  a consultant in emergency medicine, a consultant physician in general medicine and care of the elderly and a consultant physician with an interest in respiratory medicine.  Those are very highly qualified and highly paid clinicians.  If you add up all those appointments, it is a very significant revenue investment in the future of the Causeway Hospital.</p><p>I have to be honest &#8212; many people have mentioned this &#8212; that there were difficulties and uncertainty about the future of the Causeway Hospital, and it was difficult to recruit consultants as a result of that.  As a result of the new management team that we have in the Northern Trust, there is a much brighter future and a certainty.  There is a commitment from the chief executive to the Causeway that has encouraged senior clinicians to apply for positions in the Causeway.  Much of the praise for the turnaround in that situation has to go to the new chief executive and his team, who have done a lot of work to transform the future of the Northern Trust from one that was shrouded in doubt to one where there is a very bright future.  That augurs very well for the future of the Northern Trust.  Equally, public representatives tell me that there is an open-door policy; Members of the Assembly and MPs who have problems and difficulties are getting their voices heard by the new management team.  That has to be a good thing.</p><p>Causeway Hospital, like several other smaller acute hospitals across Northern Ireland, has, in the past, experienced difficulties.  However, these appointments are good news for the people who use the Causeway Hospital.  It is expected that these permanent &#8212; I emphasise that word &#8212; postings will enhance the continuity and quality of care for patients.  I do not know where the problem that Oisin &#8212; sorry, I will say \"Oisin\" because I cannot pronounce his second name &#8212; identified about the lack of continuity is coming from.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>I certainly will.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Adjournment: Causeway Hospital"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>That is a valid point.  Urology is a particularly difficult area throughout Northern Ireland.  Every trust is finding it difficult to recruit consultants in that field.  Indeed, yesterday, in response to a question about cancer waiting lists, I quoted urology as causing 35% of the delays.  However, that is a specific issue that is related not so much to the Causeway but to that specialism, where we really cannot appoint people at all when vacancies arise.  I would like to think that all the other issues that I have quoted indicate that there is a commitment to the Causeway.</p><p>In capital investment, remember that the Causeway opened only in 2001.  I very clearly remember it being built.  A friend of mine designed the roundabout at the hospital; I remember chatting to him about it.  It is a very modern hospital.  You would not expect a huge degree of capital investment in a hospital of that age because it is still relatively modern.  That having been said, we spent &#163;2&#183;3 million and &#163;1 million in the last two years, so there is &#163;3&#183;3 million that has been invested in that hospital.</p><p>That is entirely normal.  Current projects under consideration for the Causeway Hospital include the installation of a wind turbine generator at an estimated cost of &#163;1&#183;2 million.  There is already one at the Ulster University and one at Antrim Area Hospital.  Again, the fact that we are prepared to spend such a large amount of money on renewable energy indicates a commitment to the site and to hospital.

You go to Newry, Downpatrick, Craigavon or wherever.  It is a long distance to the other cover, and it is therefore important that we plug the gaps in Kilkeel.  As he knows, this has been going on since last May.  In July, there were long shifts around the Twelfth fortnight for which there was no cover, because staff were not available to do it.  That is why I am hoping that the &#163;3&#183;1 million will have some impact on overall performance in Northern Ireland.  I do not want patients to be going to A&amp;E at Daisy Hill Hospital or Downe Hospital, because, on many occasions, that is not what is required.

That puts tremendous pressure on clinicians.  A greater awareness of Alzheimer's is combined with larger numbers.  It is, therefore, still a real challenge.

I know that it is quite easy to criticise our chief executives and directors, but the problem &#8212; the Member will have to face up to this &#8212; is that we have recently lost three very capable senior executives of health trusts to England, where they offer packages that are way in excess of anything that we are allowed to offer under the guidelines issued by DFP.  I am particularly annoyed about losing one individual who, everybody in the House accepted, was absolutely outstanding. If we are to retain the best talent in Northern Ireland, we have to look at pay and conditions.  I know that it will be unpopular if I suggest that they should be paid the going salary for the crucial work that they do.  However, I flag that up as an issue that will arise in the future that I am particularly worried about.</p><p>Senior health staff all have contracts under which they are permitted to receive statutory pay increases.  I can assure you that those have been very modest, and, taking into account increases in their pension contributions, all of them, as far as I am aware, have taken a pay cut.  There are two exceptions to that, because two trust chief executives are also qualified consultants.  They are on a different pay scale to the non-consultants, which is why it may seem that their pay is quite high.  However, you should remember that, if they were doing consultancy work with some private add-ons, they would be receiving a very high standard of pay.</p><p>I believe that we now have in place a very strong team of chief executives and directors at all levels in the health trusts.  We have seen some quite remarkable turnarounds and improvements in performance throughout the service in Northern Ireland.  One of my roles is to try to keep that team together for as long as possible.  That will be difficult, given what I see happening in England, where that talent is recognised in both status and pay.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Health, Social Services and Public Safety: Health Service: Senior Staff Salaries"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>We are looking at that, but I assure you that we will never reach the situation where anyone in Northern Ireland is paid anything like that amount of money.  Some of our top staff are in charge of budgets of &#163;600 million or &#163;700 million &#8212; indeed, it is over &#163;1 billion in the Belfast Trust &#8212; and in their delivery, the better and efficient management of their trusts and a more efficient delivery of health-care provision, good chief executives or directors can save more than their salary.  Liam Donaldson's report stated clearly that we needed to recognise that talent. It is not just me who recognises it. Chairmen of trusts throughout England are eyeing up Northern Ireland for potential transfer deals, if I can put it that way.  That tells me that we have some very capable and special staff in Northern Ireland.</p><p>I want to flag up one other issue.  Many English trusts are moving to joint health and social care provision, whereas, up to now, they have been split.  Where is the only place in the United Kingdom that they can get good, experienced staff with skills in health and social care?  It is in Northern Ireland.

I think that that is the first rule.  If you want to promote an area, talk it up; do not talk it down.</p><p>The second thing I would like to say is that there has already been significant public investment.  I want to pay tribute to the Minister for the work she has done.  I remember that when Caterpillar lost so many jobs, she undertook to work with it through Invest NI to see what opportunities there might be.  A lot of the job losses at Caterpillar were replaced by additional work that was brought into Northern Ireland.

I do not want her to take too much comfort from that:  there are still big gaps.  Nevertheless, progress has been made.  With regard to the point that Mr McMullan made, if we are going to promote small businesses in rural areas, that is one of the important parts of the infrastructure that we need to have in place.  I believe that this is one way of retaining people, although I am not allied to the idea that you provide employment opportunities and training facilities in every small village and hamlet.  For a start, it is not practical.  We want to broaden people's horizons as well.  If they have to travel 15 or 20 miles to find those opportunities and get quality training, that has to happen.</p><p>There are things that are not within the Minister's remit, such as the railway and roads.

Those Members who are more inclined to exaggerate need to be reminded that a certificate is a qualification, not a conversion.  Catholicism, let alone strict adherence to the Catholic faith, is not a prerequisite.</p><p>The SDLP is a strong advocate of parental choice, which is why we fought so hard to ensure that the Irish-medium, integrated and voluntary grammar schools were represented on the board of the new Education Authority.  We have a unique education landscape in Northern Ireland, which must be managed respectfully and inclusively.  Many parents want their children to be taught in a Catholic ethos, but by no stretch of the imagination does that mean that they want their children to be segregated.</p><p>As a former teacher and principal who has colleagues, and has taught many pupils, who were not from the Catholic tradition, I find the motion disappointing and, indeed, ignorant of what a Catholic education entails.  Faith formation is an integral part of a Catholic education.  It is like a three-legged stool:  what happens in the school, the parish and the home.  They are all complementary; if you take one away, the stool crashes.  The religious education provided by our teachers is essential for the right foundation in life and the development of the Catholic ethos.  Our primary-school teachers do not teach just religious education but the whole curriculum.  The Catholic ethos permeates all aspects of the curriculum.</p><p>Reference was made to barriers.  The certificate itself is not a barrier; it is additional training to enable nursery or primary-school teachers to conduct religious education classes confidently through a Christian ethos.  That also involves sacramental preparation in primary 4 and primary 7, which constitutes an important milestone in the religious education curriculum.  Rather, the barrier is for students who face practical difficulties in obtaining the certificate.  Students at Stranmillis University College can obtain the certificate by distance learning.  A lack of awareness coupled with little information about the course presents the first barrier for students.  Subsequently, the need to pay upfront fees and the lack of support and available resources can prove off-putting.</p><p>The motion calls for the removal of an opportunity for our student teachers to achieve an additional qualification.  We need to ensure that students from Stranmillis are fully informed and aware of this opportunity and given the full support necessary to work towards it.  That may include looking again at the provision of fees.  Students at Stranmillis should not be denied the opportunity to enhance their CVs in our increasingly competitive job market, one that will become all the more competitive with looming education cuts.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Teacher Employment: Inequality"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>I am quite happy to have greater cooperation between Stranmillis and St Mary's, but the key point is that the certificate has to be open to all students, not just those in St Mary's.

Only a few weeks ago in the Chamber we discussed another motion on STEM, and International Women's Day is just two weeks gone.  The gender imbalance in the uptake of these subjects in schools was frequently noted in that debate.  Gender imbalance in the STEM sector must be addressed as a matter of gender equality and economic urgency.</p><p>A very recent report by the Confederation of British Industry, 'Engineering Our Future', highlighted:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Women currently make up 46% of the UK's workforce, but just 15&#183;5% of the core STEM workforce.\"</p><p>Repeated studies down the years have done tremendous work to highlight how vital STEM subjects are to the economy.  This is not to disparage the arts or humanities and the important role that they play in personal education, fulfilment, society and the knowledge economy, but the lack of uptake of STEM subjects is worrying.  If we are to generate a high level of research and development, we need engineers, technicians and skilled scientists working in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The demand for STEM graduates is increasing at a time when Northern Ireland faces a brain drain, with so many young people studying and working abroad on a one-way ticket out of Northern Ireland.  This was aptly summed up in the Science and Technology Committee's report, 'Women in Scientific Careers', which was helpfully provided by the Research and Information Service.  It asserted:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the UK economy needs more STEM workers and we cannot meet the demand without increasing the numbers of women in STEM.\"</p><p>The shortfall in the sector will increase if it is left unchecked.</p><p>Various reports have noted the concern that there is a gap that needs to be bridged between STEM education and what industry requires.  We cannot have a discrete departmental approach to this. The Minister for Employment and Learning, the Minister of Education and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment need to come together to ensure that the STEM curriculum is attractive to employers and equips young people with the skills that are prized by industry.</p><p>A Member mentioned earlier the good work that goes on in primary and post-primary schools. I agree, but there is not enough of it; it is not universal across the system.  I am particularly concerned about the reduction in the Sentinus budget.  There is one STEM bus that travels round schools in Northern Ireland.  That one bus is not even enough.  With less money now, we are in a serious position.</p><p>STEM is not confined to graduates.  A study in 2013 by the CBI reported that 42% of UK employers had struggled to recruit STEM-proficient staff at every level, ranging from apprentices to postgrads.  There is an important role here for further education colleges in helping to bridge that gap.</p><p>We must build the foundation of STEM in schools.  Likewise, it is vital that students get correct career advice that is tailored to them as early as possible.  STEM is male-dominated. Reasons for the lack of female representation in the industry are varied, but tackling these barriers in schools is one of the first steps that we must take. Informative and correct career advice should ensure that more girls and young women are fully aware of the benefits that studying these subjects can bring. It is not a case of forcing students into taking subjects that they have no interest in, but no student should choose not to take up a STEM subject because of a lack of information or a misperception of it being a boys-only club.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>I thank the Minister for her statement.

At the outset, I thank the Department for the extra briefing that it provided us with last week.</p><p>The number of children and young people with special educational needs and statements is rising, and, with it, the number of concerned parents.  With the new Education Authority coming into place on 1 April, this is an opportunity for us to enhance education for all our children and young people.  As I said, the number of people on the SEN register and those with statements has increased since 2009-2010.  In fact, even when school numbers were declining, the number of students with special educational needs was on the rise.  Improvements in the methods used and approach taken for pupils with special educational needs have helped ensure that children with those needs are identified.  The challenge now is to ensure that the right support is there.  Pupils with special educational needs cannot be left behind.  Early intervention is vital.</p><p>At this stage, I am largely in support of the Bill's policy intention and the number of proposals.  As a previous contributor to the debate said, it is important that the system be transparent and that we see the whole package.  It is particularly important that it is navigable for parents and young people.  That is important in the light of proposals that pupils who are over the compulsory school age will have rights conferred on them that were previously exercised by parents.  I must say that I hope that the Committee will fully scrutinise the pros and cons of that proposal.</p><p>I am broadly supportive of the legislation, which will help to support our young people.  However, there are a number of clauses that I feel could be improved.  I note that clause 5 involves reducing from 29 days to 22 days the period during which the relevant evidence can be provided to the authority.  I understand the policy intention behind that, which is to reduce bureaucracy and tackle delays in the system.  I sympathise, but I also worry that it will put extra pressure on the SENCOs, or learning support coordinators, who are already under strain.  The shortened period may prove to be even more challenging, given all the new changes that the Bill may bring.  I hope that, as the Bill progresses, the Minister and the Committee can consider the best ways in which to address unnecessary delays in the process while avoiding putting extra strain on schools and staff.</p><p>I would welcome some clarity on how the added duties will impact on schools' boards of governors.  I declare an interest as the chair of the board of governors of Grange Primary School.  Last week, we attended fantastic child-protection training to upskill us all.  You have to think of all the other committees, and so on, that school governors are on, whether they concern finance, selection, recruitment or whatever, and the training that they require.  That is being added to, so we need a lot of clarity on how it will impact on boards of governors.</p><p>When we look back on the responses to the consultation on Every School a Good School around three years ago, we can see that the themes that emerged then are still very relevant today.  One was funding and the concerns that we have about that.  The Minister's announcement at the Committee meeting last week about special educational needs funding is a concern, even though he says that &#163;10 million more is going into the Education Authority.  However, that &#163;10 million cannot fix everything.  The reduction in the number of classroom assistants by 1,000 will have a major impact on effective special educational needs provision in schools.</p><p>I am also worried about the capacity of the school workforce.  The widely held view is that it does not have the capacity at this particular time and that the increased workload will be put on learning support coordinators and principals in nursery schools and, in particular, small schools.  Again, boards of governors will ask how they are to deliver all of that.  The increased responsibility and accountability for schools that is being experienced by boards of governors is already a problem.   Some mainstream teachers, particularly in early years, do not have the necessary knowledge and skills to make adequate provision for children with special educational needs.</p><p>It talks about a programme with training and development.  Where will we get the trainers to do that, with the depleted Curriculum Advisory and Support Service (CASS) that we have at the minute?  Where will the teachers get the time to be trained?  You have to get into the shoes of the classroom teacher in, maybe, a typical, small, rural primary school that has a composite class of 30 children, a number of whom have special educational needs, and, maybe, one or two classroom assistants.  You have to consider the day-to-day management in that situation.  Previously, I taught in the post-primary sector as a mathematics teacher.  You have to prepare your work if you are going out for the odd day for a course or whatever, but think about preparing the work for a primary composite class of 30 children with different levels of ability and giving line-by-line instruction to the classroom assistant for the child with special educational needs.  Following your one- or two-day course, you then come back to pick up the pieces and so on to ensure that learning has progressed.  Let us get into the shoes of our teachers who will become the learning support coordinators &#8212; the key people at delivering this.</p><p>I am also concerned about the level of collaboration between the health and education sectors.  We all know that a multidisciplinary approach works, but the learning support coordinator is going to have to coordinate as well as teach a full timetable to their 30 P3s, P4s or whoever.  I would like to see more statutory duty placed on the health sector.  I know that the Department of Education cannot put a statutory duty on the health sector, but I think that is what we need.</p><p>I think we all agree that early identification and intervention is key.  As the SENCO moves to the new role of a learning support coordinator, they will carry out various tests and so on, but we need to devise a comprehensive training programme in the field of testing and data analysis, thus empowering them.  They need to be up to speed, but they need to come back to their school and bring the rest of their staff up to speed as well.  That is not an easy job.</p><p>There are concerns about diagnosis and assessment in schools.  Schools see that as the remit of health professionals, such as educational psychologists.  Schools are concerned that that might attract legal challenges when the learning support coordinator takes on the role.</p><p>On the same theme, the new plan is opposed to a statement.  Parents and carers have expressed concern about that.  The coordinated support plan means a reduction in the legally enforceable rights for the provision.  I think that is a key point.</p><p>I want to move on to a few other things.  Everyone's priority should be the welfare of the pupil and ensuring that pupils' special educational needs are given the highest standards of tailored support possible.  The best way to do that is to work with the people who will be responsible for the realisation of the proposals, through meaningful engagement, robust training and real support.  Yes, the legislation is very important and, as Members who have spoken previously have said, we need to get this right, but the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  I look forward to the outworkings of this very, very important Bill and seeing where it will have a real impact on what is happening in our classrooms, where we will have effective early intervention and where it can be managed by the learning support coordinator, the principal and the board of governors.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-09", "body": "<p>Minister, in an earlier response, you mentioned the NGOs.

I was not expecting to be called so quickly.</p><p>Coming into the Chamber for the debate this evening, I prepared myself to listen to all the great achievements that have been grasped from the hands of power at Westminster by the various parties.  I am not surprised, however, that I have not heard anything.  The BBC leaders' debate last week featuring the parties from Britain is a stark illustration of the complete failure of local parties to make any impact whatsoever at Westminster.  There was no voice and no concern for local issues, and I thought that it was a very pertinent example of how local issues simply do not hit the political radar when it comes to the Westminster political elite.  To pretend anything else is a complete fallacy, and I think that parties are simply horse-trading for votes ahead of an election when they talk about being kingmakers.</p><p>The DUP likes to believe that it will be the kingmaker in a new Government; it talks itself up, but it is complete nonsense.  I think that there is an awakening in Britain as well, in that people are starting to realise and to ask who exactly they will be getting into bed with when it comes to the DUP.  It is a party that would undoubtedly look to set back the clock on civil rights across these islands; it is a party that, in recent weeks, has been involved in race rows; and some of its leadership figures believe that the earth is not older than 6,000 years.  I think that that is starting to resonate in Britain and that people are starting to ask who the DUP is.  This is the party, of course, that, amongst its leadership, has climate change deniers as well.  I think that some of the questions will start to shine a light.</p><p>From the SDLP, there is such hypocrisy.  Last week, when its leader was questioned on his very, very poor attendance record, he said that his constituents do not want to see him sitting in Westminster.  That is exactly what Sinn F&#233;in is saying.  You are wasting your time talking to yourself on the green Benches at Westminster.  Anything that people have gathered has been gathered from direct negotiations, be it the devolution of policing and justice powers or the devolution of corporation tax that is eventually coming.  It has been direct negotiations with the British Government, and that is exactly what it is.</p><p>My colleague has outlined some of the issues around the principles of this.  It goes without saying that a British Parliament never has, does not, and never will have any right to adjudicate over Irish affairs.  We stand firmly behind that.  It is one of the reasons why, as a party, we received the most votes at the Westminster election last year.  It is not as if, as one of the Members claimed recently, we are somehow conning the electorate.  We go to the electorate as proud Irish republicans.

You are at West End matinees and everywhere else.

We need to look around us and realise that there is an alternative.  There is no reason why we should not look at places such as Latin America.  In Chile, they use moneys from corporate taxes to invest in tuition fees so that children who have been locked out of education for many years can now avail themselves of it.  In Venezuela, where they use their natural resources to fund social missions, they have eradicated numeracy and literacy problems, and they are genuinely lifting millions of people out of poverty.

I am not sure if he has party support for scoffing at the idea of repatriating powers from Westminster and breaking the link with the Union.  I am sure that many of his party will be surprised that he said such in the Chamber today.  However, if we are to truly empower local communities to continue to raise attainment in schools and eradicate inequalities in Irish society, we must be in control of the choices that are to be made. As long as economic power resides in Westminster, we will remain locked in a Tory trap.  The Union offers us nothing but the abhorrent and divisive agenda of austerity.  If we act collectively, we can end the Tories' reckless mismanagement of our economy.  If all sections of civil society &#8212; trade unions, political parties and the people we represent &#8212; stand united in defence of our public services and local jobs, we can build a fairer society.</p><p>We must fight for sustainable employment, a living wage and improved working conditions for our people.  Our combined forces must be on promoting innovation, encouraging our life sciences sector and our tourism industry and strengthening manufacturing.

At the very heart of that is the idea that we must smash the notion that there is no alternative.  There is an alternative.  There are alternatives all around the world, where the rights and interests of the many in society are put ahead of the few.

Again, I find that welcome.</p><p>Dominic Bradley highlighted how austerity has resulted in a huge fall in standards for people in the North of Ireland and that austerity was what he called \"a dead hand\" on our economy.</p><p>Judith Cochrane outlined how the cuts have caused major problems for the people of the North of Ireland, and Mr McQuillan also referred to living in a very difficult economic times.</p><p>Fearghal McKinney, from a position that, in my view, was very pro-UK, took great issue with the fact that the motion calls for us to note a number of things, but he missed the fact that it declares opposition to austerity policies, yes, but also:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"calls on the British Government to pursue, in the immediate term, a policy of economic stimulus\".</p><p>That is a very clear action in my view.</p><p>It was interesting that the Minister, in welcoming the opportunity to have this debate, noted that we do not often have enough debates around policy.  I welcome the fact that that was a developing consensus in the Chamber.  The Minister noted that a number of issues were missing.  I agree with him in terms of the good work that has been done; I acknowledge that, and I will reference it.  However, I suppose that I would make reference to his analogy that the motion had failed to acknowledge \"Sinn F&#233;in austerity\".  I suggest that the Minister's word \"austerity\" should be changed to \"protection\".  And, if it is the case that money has been kept in the pockets of the most vulnerable, I and my party are very happy with that result.</p><p>In relation to the motion itself, as we have heard today from Members, there are plans for further cuts of up to &#163;30 billion.  We need to fight collectively, tooth and nail, to protect vulnerable people in our society, support our local economy and invest in public services.  The Tories have promised a further &#163;12 billion of cuts to welfare provision, and we do not even know clearly, or they do not even have the decency to tell us or outline exactly, where those cuts would come.  What we know, from past experience, is that those cuts will be targeted at the poorest and most vulnerable in our society.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant"}, {"date": "2015-04-14", "body": "<p>No, I will not.

Even by Westminster's own yardstick, austerity has failed.  Lost growth and higher debt are just the financial costs of Westminster's failure, but the human cost has been higher still.  Analysis, even by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has found that the coalition's tax and benefit changes have indeed hit poorest households hardest.

I welcome the opportunity to have the debate in the House, albeit for the second occasion.</p><p>I agree with the Chair of the Education Committee that there are two distinct issues here and that it is appropriate and important that we do not cloud one with the other.  One of the issues, as has rightly been pointed out, concerns the Fair Employment and Treatment Order and the exemption issue.  The second is clearly about the use of the religious education certificate in the appointment of teachers to both primary and nursery schools.  As the proposer of the motion indicated, the exemption from fair employment law has well outlived its sell-by date.  I think that there is consensus in the Chamber around that.  It is very clear that our society and our education system are growing in culture, tradition and diversity.  Our education provides for children from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds.  Therefore, the same opportunity must be given to those who want to teach in schools.</p><p>As a party, we have supported, and continue to support, the claim that the continuation of the exception is wrong and outdated, and we have called on OFMDFM to take forward proposals for the removal of the exemption in article 71 of the Fair Employment and Treatment Order following the establishment of the Education and Skills Authority.  It is clearly now a matter for OFMDFM.</p><p>I agree with Mr McCausland when he talks about having a genuine debate and discussion.  The place for that genuine debate is after the introduction of the single equality Bill to address all those outstanding equality issues.  The Education and Skills Authority is now agreed.  Such an approach would provide a basis for open dialogue with key interest groups and provide for ample debate in a neutral environment.</p><p>I &#8212; like many Members, I hope &#8212; welcome the removal of any barrier in front of aspiring teachers, but March 2013 provided the assessment of the impact of the religious certificate required to teach in Catholic maintained primary and nursery schools.  As Pat Sheehan quite rightly pointed out, the certificate is a qualification.  There is no statistical evidence to suggest that the certificate requirement has resulted in inequalities in employment.  However, the review did identify barriers to accessing the certificate, which may lead to inequalities for those who wish to attain it.  The review highlighted three main reasons for students not taking up the certificate:  financial outlay; time commitment; and lack of support.  That is where our attention should lie &#8212; on making the process accessible for all.

As a member of the Education Committee, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this stage of the Bill.  It is suggested that the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill will give effect to the legislative changes necessary to support the revised SEN and inclusion framework.</p><p>It is important to reflect on the steady increase in the number of our young people with SEN over the last 10 years.  The Minister alluded to some of the statistics, but it is worth reflecting that, in 2014-15, 74,435 pupils had special educational needs, and 15,972 had a statement.  As the Minister pointed out, children with special educational needs now represent 4&#183;9% of the total school population.  Therefore, we must rise to that challenge.</p><p>It is important to reflect on two of the principles of the Bill.  The first is the enhanced duties for boards of governors, which will be required to prepare and keep under review a personal learning plan for each pupil with SEN.  The Bill also places a duty on boards of governors to designate a teacher, as the Chair said, as a learning support coordinator.  That role is currently filled by special educational need coordinators.</p><p>One of the key pieces of the proposed legislative framework requires the Education Authority to request help where it believes that the Health and Social Care Board could help in the discharge of duties.  This is an important area, and I certainly want to explore that principle in more detail.  A survey in 2010 found that just 14% of teachers thought that there was a coherent approach across health and social care, and education.  Whilst we recognise that no single Department can impose a duty on another, I would welcome the Minister's thoughts about how we can explore increased cooperation or coordination or how the system can be streamlined.</p><p>Three quarters of teachers who responded to the survey &#8212; again, I ask the Minister to comment on this &#8212; indicated at the time that they did not have the expertise to take on additional responsibilities relating to SEN, and they stated that schools do not have the resources.</p><p>I think that, given increasing need and the rise in the number of pupils with SEN, we have the opportunity through this Bill to modernise the approach taken so that schools, and educationalists generally, are clear and certain about their duties.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-09", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.

My colleague Megan Fearon had hoped to speak today, but unfortunately she has a sore throat.  I hope that I will give voice to her radical, progressive and hard work on the issue.</p><p>First of all, I congratulate the AERC.  I am pleased that we are having the opportunity to have the debate, but the proof will be in the pudding, and we need to see the recommendations being advanced and delivered.  I have a sense that society and the wider community will watch this one very closely.</p><p>We should acknowledge that this place, whilst far from perfect, has changed.  I reflect on coming to this Assembly as a PA to another very formidable MLA, Mary Nelis, at a time when women candidates and women MLAs were almost hissed at during their contributions to debates.  So, whilst we have not got it perfect, we should reflect on the fact that this place has come so far from where it was back in 1998.</p><p>Hopefully, we will have actions coming out of the recommendations.  As a party, we changed our constitution to tackle and properly reflect gender representation.  Those recommendations need to be both progressive and radical, and we need to reflect on other parliamentary structures.  For example, if we look at the South African model, we see that 45% of the Parliament is made up of women.  So, we have a long way to go.</p><p>In relation to the role that we have played, whilst we have to do more, as Caitr&#237;ona Ruane said, five of the last six co-options for Sinn F&#233;in were women, three out of our four MEPs are women, and we have three female Ministers.  So, certainly there has been a heavy lift and a lot of work done, not only to ensure that women are part of the process but that they are active participants in leadership and decision-making processes.</p><p>There are two important points that have come out of this discussion.  The media's representation of this place, the media's rush to our male leadership and the negativity that comes from certain elements of the media will put wider society &#8212; of course, I include women in that &#8212; off the whole notion of active participation in politics and this place.</p><p>There is a big lift there.</p><p>The bigger lift is within the leadership of the political parties.

On behalf of my fellow colleagues on the Committee, I support the motion and call for the recommendations made in it to be implemented by the Department.</p><p>We welcome the fact that the Department created a cycling unit and developed a draft strategy, which, I understand, will be finalised this summer and with the delivery plan commencing thereafter.  The strategy has a vision of establishing a cycling culture to give people the freedom and confidence to travel by bicycle and where all road users can safely share a space with mutual respect.  We noted that the draft strategy had not been rural proofed.  However, we have been assured that the delivery plan will be subject to rural proofing, and we feel that this is extremely important.</p><p>In terms of current provision, we feel that there is a relatively limited cycling network across the North at present.  At the minute, there are about 25,000 miles for vehicular traffic, compared to 800 miles designated as a national cycling network, and 700 of those miles are shared by vehicles.  So, only 106 miles are dedicated as traffic-free cycle paths.  We share the view of many cyclists that the current provision is relatively fragmented.  This is compounded by the fact that there is no single agency or Department responsible for the current network, which has resulted in missing links and a variation in quality.  Indeed, Andrew Grieve, the head of the cycling unit, and colleagues, came to Omagh to inspect the network there, and whilst we are very glad of the network that is currently there, we noticed a number of missing links.  We hope that the strategy will help to fill in those missing links.  I have no doubt that the situation is the same in other towns across the country.</p><p>In terms of the master plan approach referred to in the strategy, it must involve other stakeholders, such as councils and Sustrans both at reception and delivery stages.</p><p>Recommendation 26 refers to the importance of rural areas.  We felt that the draft strategy was a little bit vague on rural areas.  We note that the document said, \"where opportunities arise\", and where there is \"cycling demand\" in reference to rural areas.  Combine that with the decision not to rural proof the draft strategy, and we are very anxious that rural and urban areas get equal treatment in the delivery of any strategy.</p><p>Recommendation 30 refers to the development of greenways.  We believe that there is great potential for the development of greenways in rural and urban areas throughout the North.  We strongly feel that disused railway beds that straddle the North should be scoped out at as potential greenways; indeed, that motion was passed at our ard fheis two weeks ago.  In particular, we propose that the DRD should look at the Great Northern Railway with a view to bringing all or parts of it back into use as a greenway.  The Minister made many references to the cycling revolution, and we think that this would be a major step forward in creating that cycling revolution.</p><p>Along with other colleagues on the Committee, I visited Westport in County Mayo to learn about the social and economic impact of the greenway there, which is based on the Great Western Railway line.  It is a huge benefit to the area, with over 200,000 cyclists using it last year.  Indeed, the Committee went there in May, and I went back on a family holiday with the children in August, and we cycled from Achill right back to Westport.  We saw the huge impact that that has on the vibrancy of Mulranny and Newport and the number of businesses that have been established.  Indeed, it has consolidated Westport as a destination for activity tourism.</p><p>We believe that, from an engineering perspective, and as the foundations are already there, the greenways should be relatively easy to construct.  Obviously, there will be issues with securing the agreement of local landowners, but it should be a relatively cost-effective means of establishing a comprehensive cycling network through the North and on a cross-border basis.</p><p>In planning the development of the greenways, we propose that the DRD works in conjunction with its counterparts across the border &#8212; the National Roads Authority, the county councils and the tourist board &#8212; to ensure that the network here is connected across the island and across Europe.  We believe that the Minister and the Department should look at INTERREG as a potential basis for securing funding for such greenways.  We support the recommendation for pilot greenways in those areas and believe that they should be spread geographically throughout the Six Counties and on a cross-border basis.</p><p>In conclusion, I support the recommendations.</p><p>I commend Paul Carlisle and all the team on the DRD Committee for pulling this together and for organising the fact-finding visits and witnesses.

Through correspondence with the Minister, I am aware that it is on course to meet its PFG target by 31 March this year.  We have seen how MARA, the arts, the fuel poverty, the health checks and all the different components of the programme are having a meaningful impact on people's lives.  Of course, on top of that, opportunities will be ushered in with the new rural development programme, which will address issues relating to social isolation and poverty.</p><p>In my contribution, I will speak specifically about one of the recommendations &#8212; my colleagues will pick up on other recommendations &#8212; on deprivation and how it is measured.  During the inquiry, we heard some very strong views that the current methodology for assessing deprivation, the NI multiple deprivation measure (MDM), underestimates the extent of deprivation in rural areas.  That theme was particularly flagged up by the Rural Development Council (RDC), the Rural Community Network (RCN) and the Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) in their contributions to the review.  I commend all those groups for making their way up here; we, of course, were also out in the community meeting organisations.</p><p>Those issues were also robustly flagged up by Trutz Haase when he appeared before the Committee.  Last year, other MLAs, including Patsy McGlone, and I co-hosted a seminar organised by the Carnegie Trust on this very topic, entitled 'Poverty Amongst Plenty?'  One of the recurring themes is that, under the current methodology, small and concentrated areas of deprivation are more easily identified in urban areas whereas deprivation is more dispersed in rural areas.  In urban areas, there is more of a social concentration of deprivation, whereas it is more widely dispersed in rural areas.  You could be in poverty but living in the midst of affluent neighbours in a rural area, and that is quite extensive.</p><p>The completion of the report is timely as we begin to scrutinise the Rural Proofing Bill.  Many of the themes that were raised in the review will be relevant to the Rural Proofing Bill, which has been designed to protect and develop rural areas.</p><p>A number of concerns were raised about the measures, including the fact that the MDM focuses on income and not expenditure.  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation's minimum income standard project concluded that it costs 20% more to live in rural areas.  Proximity to services is also a big issue.  The weighting that was attributed to the overall score is only 10%; a study commissioned by the Church of Scotland and carried out by Geddes and Houston in 2012 concluded that deprivation of access is overwhelming in rural areas, which can have a significant negative impact on people's lives through employment, medical care and participation in cultural and social activities.  That was supported by a study by McKendrick et al in 2011, which noted that the effect of the lower weighting, in which the domain of access to services is weighted at 10%, is that there is a negative impact.  No rural areas are ranked in the top 10% of super output areas for deprivation across the North.  The closest rural area that I am aware of is in Castlederg in my constituency, which ranks ninety-seventh, out of the 890.</p><p>The UFU representatives made a very good point in their contribution.  They said that a method must be found to pinpoint deprivation in rural areas, unlike urban areas, which are more socially segregated.  They said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"One person could be in poverty and the person down the road could be in relative affluence.\"</p><p>The RDC and the RCN made the same points.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Tackling Rural Poverty and Social Inclusion Framework"}, {"date": "2015-03-02", "body": "<p>6.

Beidh m&#233; ag caint in &#233;adan an ruin seo inniu.  I say at the outset that I oppose today's motion.  I oppose it because, first, it is based on a false premise.  It presupposes that there is a worth in taking seats at Westminster, that there is an impact and value to doing so and that it somehow reaps benefits for the people in the North. I have seen no benefits come to the North as a result of people taking their seats at Westminster, but it is up to them to do that.  I represent West Belfast in the Assembly, and I can only say that I do not hear that from anybody there.  Nobody has raised it with me &#8212; not once.  Gerry Adams went before the people of West Belfast for many, many years, and he got a resounding endorsement on an abstentionist ticket.  Nobody wanted Gerry Adams to take his seat, and that is the case throughout the North.  Nobody who votes for Sinn F&#233;in wants Sinn F&#233;in to take seats in Westminster, because they do not see it as having value.  Paul Maskey is going in front of the electorate in a few weeks' time, and I am sure that he will receive the same ringing endorsement as Gerry Adams had before him.  I am convinced of that.</p><p>The leader of the party that tabled the motion, Alasdair McDonnell, is not here today, and I am a bit disappointed, because I would like to have heard from him.  I read in a paper that he is in the bottom 10 out of 645 MPs at Westminster in attendance for votes.  That tells me that he does not have much confidence in the system either.  If he has confidence in it, why is he not there using his vote to make the impact that, he feels, it would have?  I would like to hear from Alasdair about why he is not here today to extol the virtues of taking his seat in Westminster.  I thought that that might have been useful.  However, we will go on and see whether he appears.</p><p>As for influence, Sinn F&#233;in has participated in all the major negotiations and all the big political decisions that affect people in the North, and we have done that successfully without taking seats in Westminster.  It has not been a requirement; actually, it has not even been relevant.  We have had the Good Friday Agreement, the Hillsborough agreement, the St Andrews Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement.  All five of the main parties here, plus the two Governments, signed up to the Stormont House Agreement without a mention of Westminster.  It was just not part of the equation.  Therefore, it does not matter that, out of that, people then reneged on their agreements; the fact is that agreement was made.  It is a major agreement, and it is one that we need to get back to.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Westminster Elections"}, {"date": "2015-04-20", "body": "<p>I tell the Member that we are not frightened; we just do not see it as relevant.

At the outset, I want to send my solidarity to the McCreesh family, who are in our thoughts at this time, and who continue to be held in huge reverence in our area.  I also want to sympathise with all victims of the conflict and express solidarity with them.</p><p>In 2011, more than 30,000 people gathered in south Armagh to honour the memory of Raymond McCreesh and his nine comrades who died on hunger strike in 1981.  It is not just in Newry and Armagh that they are recognised but around the world.  When Raymond's comrade Bobby Sands died on hunger strike, national Parliaments across the world stood in silence.  Streets were named in their honour, as a genuinely historic chapter in world politics was written.  Indeed, Nelson Mandela and his fellow political prisoners on Robben Island drew strength from Raymond and his comrades in their fight for justice.  The late Cardinal Tom&#225;s &#211; Fiaich said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Raymond McCreesh was captured bearing arms at the age of 19 and sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment. I have no doubt that he would have never seen the inside of a jail but for the abnormal political situation. Who is entitled to label him a murderer or a suicide?\"</p><p>Cardinal O'Fiaich was alluding to the fact that Raymond McCreesh had the misfortune to be born into one of the most heavily militarised areas anywhere in the world, to be born into the Orange state, one-party rule and institutional discrimination.  He was, effectively, born into the belly of the beast where the worst excesses of partition were visible daily.  Faced with the watchtowers, faced with the British Army patrols and faced with British brutality, Raymond, like generations of Irish republicans before him, decided to face down those conditions.</p><p>Raymond was my age when he gave his life on hunger strike.  He was just an ordinary young man.  It is because of the sacrifice of people like Raymond McCreesh that I was fortunate to be born into an entirely different political dispensation.  My generation of young republicans is separated from him only by time.  Had Raymond been born when I was, I have no doubt that he would be standing in this Chamber.</p><p>Where does the SDLP draw the line between the good old IRA and the so-called bad IRA?  The SDLP's position seems to be that nobody who was involved in the conflict should have anything named after them.  Beside McCreesh Park is Michael Mallin Park; next to it is James Connolly Park; and across the way is John Martin Gardens.  Does the SDLP suggest that we now start to rename those?  Does the SDLP now distance itself from the 1916 leaders?  Will SDLP members attend centenary events for the men and women who took up arms against the same oppressive regime?  I can tell you this:  south Armagh was a lot more peaceful in 1916 than it was in the 1970s.</p><p>Danny Kennedy has been one of the most vociferous on this issue, and it is my understanding that he was at the council meeting when the original naming took place.  Why was it not a problem in 2002?  It was not an issue for Danny Kennedy, any UUP councillor, or any DUP councillor for that matter, for six or seven years until the Orange Order made it one.  This is nothing more than a cheap stunt.  This electioneering and exploitation on the back of victims and their families is nothing short of a disgrace and should be condemned from all corners.

Like others, I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill and broadly outline Sinn F&#233;in's stance.</p><p>We are keen to support the broad principles behind the Bill.  A duty on Departments to cooperate in the delivery of services will surely only lead to better outcomes for the most important people in all of this; our children and young people.  We want to see maximum cooperation across Departments to achieve agreed and specified outcomes for children and young people, which, as mentioned by other Members, include being healthy, safety and economic well-being.  One of the most important outcomes is for children and young people to live in a society that protects their rights.  Too often, children are ignored as right-bearers in their own right.  There are a few examples of that which we could go into.  This is probably not the time or place to do so, but that is an important point to note.</p><p>We have no difficulty with the main thrust of the Bill, and we are not averse to there being a statutory duty to cooperate.  In relation to what has been mentioned around OFMDFM reporting to the Assembly &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Children's Services Co-operation Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-01-26", "body": "<p>Yes.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Children's Services Co-operation Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-01-26", "body": "<p>The Member might want to put his name down to speak.</p><p>It is all about cooperation.  Some agencies do not talk to each other and do not have the information.  Steven mentioned the 0-6 early years strategy starting at age three or four.  So, cooperation will always be a good thing.  I have my own questions about the more specified outcomes, which I will go into.  OFMDFM has the policy responsibility for children and young people (CYP), including the taking forward of the CYP strategy, and works already with Departments on the coordination of actions to take that forward.</p><p>Concerns have been raised by some that the need to report could just lead to increased bureaucracy, which, arguably, goes against what the Bill is trying to do, but we are happy enough with some of the clarification that we have received on those points.  Obviously, the effectiveness of increased cooperation has to be tracked to ensure that outcomes are being met and that we are working as efficiently as possible.</p><p>On the sharing and pooling of resources, again, we are happy with the principle behind it, but we have some reservations that it might not go far enough.  Delivering Social Change was mentioned earlier, and we see that as an important delivery model.  We would like to see more definitive work done on the pooling of resources; on how it is done, what it means in practice and whether a real budget line could be attached to it.</p><p>There are reservations that I pointed out and would welcome feedback on.  There does not appear to be any specific requirements to deliver improvements on the current situation or sanctions for not delivering.  Essentially, Departments are being enabled, but not compelled, to pool resources.</p><p>Clause 4 is probably the most contentious, and we have difficulties with the principles behind it.  We see it as the transferring of the control of the planning, development, procuring and commissioning of services for children and young people to the Health and Social Care Board at the expense of elected representatives and, with that, the usurping of ministerial autonomy to set policy direction.  We have difficulty with giving control to an arm's-length body of the Health Department, which has already been criticised for being top-heavy, and also because Ministers should retain their ability to develop plans according to their own priorities.  We agree absolutely with the principle of ensuring cooperation and want to support a Bill that puts requirements on people to do that.  However, that support stops short of supporting giving authority to an arm's-length body to make determinations or to modify plans, which, in my opinion, takes away from, rather than strengthens, democratic accountability.</p><p>In conclusion, there is some ambiguity around the Bill.  Sometimes, it can be difficult to make out its policy intent in a clear way.  The Bill requires restructuring and amendments, which I am sure we will come to at a later stage.  It is important to recognise that there is already good practice and that good work being done in this area.  My take on the general intent of the Bill is that it is to make good existing practice systemic.  We can support that because, ultimately, the protection of children is paramount.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Children's Services Co-operation Bill: Second Stage"}, {"date": "2015-01-20", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.

I support the motion.  As part of today's debate regarding the report of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister on the Assembly Committee's priorities for European scrutiny, it is important that we put a strong focus on the need to initiate a debate on the importance of continued European Union membership for the North of Ireland and the consequences for us should an incoming British Government lose a referendum on such membership.  Let me clear from the outset that, while I believe that it is important for us to increase our level of engagement with the institutions of the European Union, such an engagement must be not only constructive but critical.  There are a lot of policy and legislative issues that are relevant to here and have an impact.</p><p>As we are well aware, in many instances, British interests in relation to European Union membership are not those of the North of Ireland.  While we need to ensure that the North's voice is heard, which we do through the Statutory Committees, it is most important that we engage in debate with all sectors of society across Ireland.  Given the adverse effect that such an exit from the European Union would have on our developing an all-Ireland economy, such a debate must include all voices North and South, as social development North and South would be negatively impacted.</p><p>We are only too well aware that European funding, such as CAP for farmers, ESF, Peace and INTERREG, is vital in the context of jobs, growth and investment.  Our priority, given the dire economic situation facing us all from the austerity agenda of the various conservative European Governments and, in turn, finding ourselves having to deal with year-on-year cuts to our block grant by David Cameron's cabinet of Tory millionaires, is to ensure that European Union funding is made as accessible and effective as possible.  European funding must be directed to where it is most needed.</p><p>The European Commission's work programme for 2015 has given priority to a forward-looking climate change policy.  We who are tasked with sustainable development here in the North also need to be forward-looking in this regard.  Sustainable green energy must be pursued with vigour, and any attempts to introduce environmentally disastrous plans promoting fracking need to be resisted.  Fracking's negative consequences for public health are certainly concentrating the minds of my constituents in Fermanagh at this time.  I take this opportunity to thank my party colleague Martina Anderson for hosting a very important European conference debate on the issue at the Lough Erne Resort recently.</p><p>The issue of fundamental rights needs to be given greater priority given its relevance to our society as one that is emerging from conflict.  While we need to be supportive of all efforts by the European Union to support human rights, we need to deliver a bill of rights for the North of Ireland, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, in the hope of ensuring adequate protections for everyone.</p><p>I wish to conclude by emphasising that the North of Ireland has benefited hugely from membership of the European Union over many years.  We see those benefits daily both in the North and on a North/South basis right across the island.  For us in the North of Ireland, in particular those who live and work in border counties North and South, any change in our membership of the EU would have drastic consequences.  Such changes have the potential to stifle the progress and development of this region.  Sinn F&#233;in representatives on the OFMDFM Committee will be tightly scrutinising our Executive's efforts to maximise the benefits of European Union membership for all the people of the North.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: European Scrutiny Priorities 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>2.

I beg to move</p><p class=\"italic\">That this Assembly expresses concern that men outnumber women by nearly three to one in high-level science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) posts; welcomes the statement by the Minister for Employment and Learning on 4 June 2013 reiterating the importance of women in the STEM sectors; and calls on the Minister for Employment and Learning, in conjunction with his Executive colleagues, to publish a strategy and action plan that addresses specifically the issue of gender imbalance in the STEM sectors.</p><p>Our economy needs more skilled scientists and engineers, and that need will not be met unless greater efforts are made to retain women in STEM careers.  'Addressing Gender Balance', a report published in 2013, identified the fact that, while high-level STEM posts constituted over 11% of the workforce, men outnumbered women by nearly three to one in those roles.  That is not a problem that is particular to the North or to Britain, but it is a problem for the island of Ireland.  Figures in 'The Irish Times' recently identified the fact that, of 118,000 people working in STEM, only a quarter were women.</p><p>In the North of Ireland, we do not have a strategy that specifically addresses the issue of women and gender imbalance in STEM careers.  The most relevant government strategies are Success through STEM and the gender equality strategy.  Success through STEM contains 20 recommendations, one of which pertains to the issue of gender imbalance.</p><p>As we commence our debate, I take the opportunity to commend the much good work that is done in our primary and secondary schools by the Executive to tackle gender stereotypes in education.  At the same time, raising the importance of engagement with the STEM industry needs to be part of teachers' continuing professional development (CPD). After much inquiry in Britain into this important matter, no new issues have been uncovered on the topic of gender diversity in STEM subjects.  While problems and solutions have long been identified, more needs to be actively done to improve the situation.  While competition for jobs is beneficial for science, careers should not be constructed in a way that deters talented women from remaining and progressing in STEM.</p><p>Despite clear imperatives and multiple initiatives to improve diversity in STEM, women remain underrepresented at senior levels across every discipline.  The gender imbalance in STEM is caused by a range of factors.  While it is commendable that an emphasis is placed on inspiring young women to choose STEM subjects, such efforts are wasted if women continue to be disproportionately disadvantaged in STEM subjects in comparison with men.  It is disappointing that biases and working practices result in systemic and cumulative discrimination against women throughout STEM study and academic careers.</p><p>The inquiry in Britain found that scientists are susceptible to the same unconscious gender bias as the rest of the population.  It is unfortunate that some are unwilling to accept this simply because professional research requires them to be objective.  As employers of academic STEM researchers, our universities and higher education institutions have ultimate responsibility for employment conditions and the greatest obligation to improve STEM careers for all researchers.  While there are many examples of good practice in diversity management, some higher education institutions across these islands appear only too willing to devolve responsibility for working hours, career support and promotion to research groups.  More standardisation is required across the higher education sector.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the House that the Athena SWAN Charter is the most comprehensive practical scheme aimed at improving STEM careers and that both our universities, Queen's University and Ulster University, are members of the Athena SWAN Charter.  The charter, founded in 2005, is awarded to universities that accept and promote the six charter principles: to address gender inequalities requires commitment and action from everyone at all levels of the organisation; to tackle the unequal representation of women in science requires changing cultures and attitudes across the organisation; the absence of diversity at management and policymaking levels has broad implications that the organisation will examine; the high loss rate of women in science is an urgent concern that the organisation will address; the system of short-term contracts has particular negative consequences for the retention and progression of women in science that the organisation recognises; and, finally, there are both personal and structural obstacles to women making the transition from PhD into a sustainable academic career in science that require the active consideration of the organisations.</p><p>Recommendations from the report commissioned in Britain call for diversity and equality training, including unconscious bias training, to be provided to all STEM undergraduate and postgraduate students by their higher education institution.  In addition, it was found that such training should be mandatory for all members of recruitment and promotion panels for STEM jobs and all line managers and supervisors of staff.  A lack of career advice and support for academic researchers can affect women disproportionately.  Higher education institutions should encourage mentoring, support networks and seminars at the research group level and monitor this practice. Such activities are encouraged by the Athena SWAN Charter that I mentioned.</p><p>As scientific research cannot always take place within regular working hours, it is recommended that research departments should determine and operate appropriate core working hours, with flexibility outside those core hours. That would ensure that most staff members were available for key meetings and that those with caring responsibilities were not disproportionately disadvantaged.</p><p>Fellowships and academic positions should be advertised with the option of working part time unless there are insurmountable obstacles to such arrangements.  All higher education institutions should review the working hours of their academic staff and the management of research groups to ensure that practices are in keeping with the needs of employees with caring responsibilities.  Such matters should not be devolved to research groups.  Line managers who pressure staff into long working hours should be held to account by their employer.</p><p>The time has come for the Minister for Employment and Learning, in conjunction with Executive colleagues, to publish a strategy and action plan that address specifically the gender imbalance in the STEM sectors.  Many excellent schemes have attempted to stem the loss of talent.  If applied with energy and determination as part of a coherent strategy, such initiatives have the potential to make our region one of the best places in the world to work in science and technology, a destination of choice for talented women, with spin-off benefits for the wider role of women in our society. I believe that we have the means of developing an integrated comprehensive and coordinated strategy for change.  That will require political vision and commitment from leaders and organisations in academia and business and a major cultural change in attitudes and approach. Finally, I commend the great efforts by the South West College in promoting STEM.  I wish it every success in its engineering careers fair that will take place this Friday and Saturday in Dungannon.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat.

I support the motion and oppose the amendment.  I should say at the outset that I will not be taking any interventions.</p><p>Sinn F&#233;in takes its responsibility seriously and strives to create an inclusive society based on mutual respect, equality and parity of esteem, the underlying principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  That involves reaching out to our fellow citizens in the unionist community and convincing them that we are serious about tackling the differences that exist between us.  I am not talking about tolerance, but about the acceptance of cultural, political and religious differences and of people who espouse those differences.  I am talking about acceptance, which, within the bounds of equality of treatment, means almost unconditional acceptance of the other.</p><p>The motion for discussion gives us an opportunity to focus on the need to give effect to the Good Friday Agreement provisions with respect to the establishment of, for example, a bill of rights for the North of Ireland and the creation of an all-Ireland charter of rights, based on agreed measures for the protection of the fundamental rights of everyone living on the island of Ireland.</p><p>The call for a bill of rights and the single equality Act is supported by a wide range of progressive opinion, including leading and influential voices from academia and civic society.  The Good Friday Agreement provided for a bill of rights for the North.  The agreement was democratically endorsed by the majority of those who cast their votes in historic referendums, North and South, in 1998.  The agreement envisaged a bill of rights particular to the circumstances of the North.  The clear import was a maximum approach to rights protection.  The purpose of a bill of rights is to build on the European Convention on Human Rights and reflect the particular circumstances of the North, a society emerging from decades of discrimination and conflict.  Provision for a bill of rights was included in the Good Friday Agreement in recognition that, as a society, we would benefit from setting down a shared set of rights.  As we continue to transform our society, developing a bill of rights is as relevant today as it was when the agreement was drafted.  It is an essential piece of work that needs to be carried forward.</p><p>The British Government were to define, in Westminster legislation, rights supplementary to those in the European Convention on Human Rights to reflect the particular circumstances of the North, drawing, as appropriate, on international instruments and experience.  Those additional rights were to reflect the principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities in parity of esteem and, taken together with the European Convention on Human Rights, were to constitute a bill of rights.  The British Government have failed to deliver on their commitment and have consistently taken the position that a bill of rights must be agreed between unionists and nationalists.  A bill of rights would outline basic human rights that all the people in northern society would be entitled to, and it would improve the lives of the most disadvantaged in our society.  It would also provide a means by which people can hold the Government to account if those rights are not being adequately protected.</p><p>Human rights are there for everyone.  It is widely agreed that a bill of rights for the North needs to address the specific realities of our society, a society of great inequalities and divisions.  As many as one person in five has a disability, and those with a disability are twice as likely to be unemployed; one in three children here lives in poverty; one in three of those who are economically inactive has no qualifications.  Sectarian and racist attacks still happen all too frequently and quietly, and quite often against a backdrop of intolerance.  It must be remembered that a survey carried out by the Equality Commission found that 91% of people in the North supported equality laws.  In another survey, carried out by the Human Rights Consortium, there was also support across the board for the right to adequate housing and an adequate standard of living, while rights in relation to mental and physical health scored highly and the right to education highest of all.</p><p>A bill of rights and a single equality Act would protect all people equally, regardless of political opinion, colour or creed, and it would protect the social and economic rights of everyone in the North of Ireland.  A single equality Act and a bill of rights are about guaranteeing a basic standard of living for everyone that is consistent and fair, providing protection for the most marginalised in society and giving them dignity and respect.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Equality Legislation: Revised Wording"}, {"date": "2015-03-10", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat.

I will also speak in favour of the motion. Like Members who have spoken before me, I thank our Clerk, Stella, and the Committee staff for their sterling work on this important subject. Indeed, I thank all those who took the time to contribute in any way to the review.  Their experience, assessment and input have been essential in evaluating the current programme.  They have identified not just the successes, of which there have been many, but the challenges that need to be addressed.</p><p>Those challenges come in many forms.  As outlined, we discussed how information could be shared, recorded and interpreted so that it could be used to best effect in the future.  We have the changing nature of the difficulties facing our rural communities as a whole but particularly those impacted by poverty and isolation.  For example, to name but a few, unemployment, emigration, severe weather, the added risk of stress for the growing number of lone workers on our farms and changes to public services adversely affect our rural communities.  That is why it is important to take stock every so often, consult individuals and stakeholders and make recommendations such as those that the Committee is making today.</p><p>For my contribution, I want to focus on the formation of the new super-councils, the role that they will play in delivering this framework and the Committee's recommendation about them.  It came as no surprise to me that the demand for information and involvement in LEADER and the local community plans exceeded expectations in the rural constituency of Mid Ulster.  As a native and a representative of the area, I am only too aware of how widely dispersed the population is and how the issues and, indeed, the solutions can differ from one part of the constituency to another.</p><p>While it is important that expectations are managed for what is achievable, I am delighted that so many people came forward, presented their thoughts and ideas and expressed their willingness to play a role in shaping the priorities for local government.  The new model of LEADER, with its wider local action group membership, will assist in involving a greater number of people, which I hope will ensure that the platform for raising concerns and providing new opportunities to tackle rural poverty and isolation will be as broad as possible.  I believe that the councils themselves are well placed to identify areas where resources need to be targeted, but, as was suggested during the review, there will be a limited budget.  To make a little go a long way, it will be imperative to match need to funding priorities and to work in partnership with all agencies and Departments, as well as voluntary and community groups, to share responsibility and best practice and to prevent duplication.</p><p>While it is right that DARD takes the lead on rural issues and provides the necessary guidance and support, it will be fully effective only when a joined-up approach is taken.  I, therefore, support the recommendation that the Department engage proactively with the new councils to ensure that they are active and vigorous in taking rural issues into account in the development of policy and the delivery of services in rural and farming communities, as well as working effectively with the groups and organisations that have been successfully involved in delivering the TRPSI framework.</p><p>In closing, I commend our Minister for her commitment in prioritising this area of work and driving this important work forward.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Tackling Rural Poverty and Social Inclusion Framework"}, {"date": "2015-02-17", "body": "<p>T4.

I have to say that I am disappointed: there are elements of the motion with which I agree, but, as it comes from Sinn F&#233;in, I have to take issue with it. There are a range of ways that you can describe the loss of &#163;1&#183;5 billion to the block grant, and noting it is not one of them.  Then again, if you have already voted in favour of such cuts, it is perhaps difficult to move on to stronger language.  After the motion, we will all be in a safer place, because Sinn F&#233;in has asked us to note the scale of the cuts. Then we are asked to further note the Tory-led Government's agenda, as if, somehow or other, further noting it will make a dent in that Tory ambition.  That is an ambition that the SDLP has been spelling out since the day and hour that the Tories came to power but which, in the end, Sinn F&#233;in actually backed.  But, once again, Ireland will be free now that we have further noted Tory intentions. In writing this, I have had to ask myself what all the pain and suffering was for if all we can do is sit here in Stormont this afternoon, \"note\" what the Tories are up to and vainly appeal to them to change their mind.  That is what the motion amounts to.  That is all that Sinn F&#233;in can come up with: \"Let's not go to Westminster, but let's ask the Tories for more.

However, the inquiry arose in response to the concerns of local residents who have questioned the way in which that target is being achieved through what they believe to be an over-reliance on wind energy.</p><p>The inquiry proved to be an immense piece of work, not just in the scope and volume of evidence that was considered but in the emotive nature of much of that evidence.  I believe that the Committee has managed to produce a fair and balanced report, with robust and perhaps challenging recommendations.</p><p>Overall, the Committee concluded that the way forward for sustainable as well as renewable energy is one that fully engages those communities that are most closely involved with its production.  That is very much reflected in the Committee&#8217;s recommendations, which call on the Department and wind energy developers to work with communities &#8212; to inform, to communicate and to respond &#8212; at every level of planning and operation.</p><p>I take the opportunity to thank all those who contributed to the debate.  Obviously, we first had the Chair, who spoke at length in moving the motion to accept the report.  She said that the Committee had received 98 submissions in response to its call for evidence.  The Committee also had oral evidence sessions with a range of stakeholders and commissioned the services of a specialist acoustician to assist it with the technical aspects of the inquiry.  We also heard that the Committee carried out a fact-finding visit to west Tyrone to see a wind farm development at first hand and to hear from the residents who lived close to the turbines.</p><p>The Committee agreed that there was a need for a strategic approach in the siting of wind energy developments.  It also considered whether a strategic approach that advocated zoning or the identification of the most appropriate location for wind turbines would be effective.  However, as we all know, it was agreed that it is now too late for the introduction of zoning in Northern Ireland as many areas &#8212;</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: Wind Energy Inquiry Report"}, {"date": "2015-03-03", "body": "<p>I thank the Member for his intervention.  I am sure that the Minister will take those points on board as he looks into the report further.</p><p>As I said, in certain places like west Tyrone, the number of operational or planned wind developments has reached saturation point.  The Committee identified a clear need for closer liaison between the strategic planning division and councils to ensure a joined-up approach and more cohesive planning for wind farms and individual turbines.  The Committee also expressed some concern that the term \"economic considerations\", which is used in PPS 18 and retained in the draft SPPS, is not clearly defined.  The Committee urges the Department to do so.</p><p>The Committee found that many submissions to the inquiry focused on perceived inadequacies in the current planning procedures and the cumulative impact of turbines.  It recommended that planning applications for connection to the grid be assessed at the same time as turbine applications, which is, I think, a common-sense approach.  The Committee believes that the requirement to notify neighbours who occupy buildings on land within 90 metres of the boundary of the application site is inadequate for the latest wind turbines, which may exceed a great height.</p><p>The Chair talked about the inquiry's second term of reference, which focused on wind turbine noise and separation distances from dwellings.  This was a very emotive part of the inquiry, as many submissions dealt with the adverse impact of perceived noise from wind turbines on respondents' day-to-day lives.  It seems that the current guidelines on permissible levels of noise are no longer adequate.  The Committee therefore recommended that the Department urgently review the use of the ETSU-R-97 guidelines with a view to adopting more modern and robust guidance for the measurement of wind turbine noise.  The Committee also recommended that the Department specify a minimum separation distance between wind turbines and dwellings.</p><p>The inquiry's final term of reference, as the Chair informed us, related to the extent of engagement by wind energy providers with communities.  Community concerns about visual amenity, noise and health did not always seem to be given due regard.  The views of residents need to be listened to, considered and taken into account.</p><p>The Committee talked about the mandatory use of the community engagement toolkit and recommended that the level of community benefit be set at government level.  It recommended that this be made a condition of planning permission and that a community-benefits register similar to the one in Scotland be set up.  That sums up the Chair's remarks.</p><p>I will turn now to other Members.  Lord Morrow raised concerns about the impacts of wind turbines:  the noise, safety, the effect on property values and the detrimental impact on the landscape.  He noted that many remain to be convinced of the benefits of wind energy and that there was a mood for a more strategic approach to be taken to planning.</p><p>Cathal Boylan was in favour of the recommendations in the report but concerned about the use of reconditioned turbines.  He stated that ETSU-R-97 was unfit for purpose and needed to be reviewed.  He said that there needs to be more effective engagement with communities.</p><p>Alban Maginness said that it was important to note the contribution made by wind energy and that, over time, its cost will decrease.  He was impressed by the efforts made by those building wind turbines with the community, and he said that engagement with communities was essential.</p><p>Sandra Overend welcomed the report's seeking to bring some clarity to this issue.  She said that there is a need for an overarching strategic approach to the siting of turbines.  She was concerned about noise pollution and distance from residential properties, and she wanted the Department to improve its methods of measuring noise pollution.</p><p>Sammy Wilson said that there was increasing alarm in Northern Ireland about the impact of wind turbines.  He also welcomed the report.  He stated that planning policy is often influenced by the guidance from the Minister's office.   He also welcomed the recommendation that those putting up wind turbines be responsible for ensuring that they meet standards.  He said that the guidance on noise levels needed to be updated and stated that the cumulative impact of wind turbines on an area needed to be taken into account.</p><p>Barry McElduff supported the recommendations in the report.  He supports the Programme for Government targets but has concerns about the over-reliance on wind energy.  He was concerned about separation distances, the cumulative impact of wind turbines and the displacement of jobs and tourism.  He also said that the ETSU-R-97 guidelines need to be reviewed.</p><p>Steven Agnew welcomed the Committee focus on wind energy.  He called for community involvement in projects.  He stated that wind energy is the cheapest form of energy production and that the price of wind energy is coming down while other sources of energy are increasing in cost.  He also said that there is a need to look strategically at energy production.</p><p>David McNarry believes that the planning approval for wind turbines is a rubber-stamping exercise.  He said that &#163;140 million has been paid in subsidies to wind energy producers.  He said that wind energy is not producing cheaper electricity, and he was concerned about the health implications of wind turbines.  He also said that there should be a halt to wind turbine development.</p><p>The last contributor was Paul Frew, who welcomed the report.  He said that the report addressed only one part of the cost of electricity and that wind power will not help industry.  He stated that wind generators are paid the same as gas generators and that wind power generators have to be paid capacity payments.  He also said that the cost of generating energy needs to be taken seriously.</p><p>In conclusion, I ask the Assembly to approve the report.  At this stage, I thank the Minister for his initial response and look forward to a more detailed response in due course.  It is also appropriate at this stage to thank the Committee staff for their hard work in the production of the report and for all their help throughout the inquiry, which turned out to be quite a large inquiry, with a great deal of work for the Committee staff.

Whether it is unfounded or not, there remains significant concern about the future of Causeway Hospital in its entirety or in the services it provides.  I also welcome the positive contributions by Members in the House thus far, particularly by the Minister's party colleagues, because they are in a really unique position to encourage and ensure the future of the Causeway Hospital.  I hope that they will continue to support it in the way in which they have shown today.</p><p>I suppose that I want to follow on from Mr Allister's point about the Donaldson report, because it is one of the points that makes me understand the uncertainty around Causeway.  Yes, the Minister has shown his commitment to Causeway being an acute hospital with an A&amp;E supporting clinical services.  That is fantastic, but the devil is always in the detail.  I would like the Minister to give more information about the way in which it will move forward as an acute hospital.  Will it have a 24-hour A&amp;E service, and what clinical services will it provide?  To be fair to the Minister; up until now, the problem with the uncertainty about Causeway has been the investment it has had.  Until recently, there have not been any clinical appointments or capital investment.  There has been no development.  Is that part of the Minister's future plans to ensure that Causeway will remain part of all this?</p><p>To come back to the Donaldson report; it is not a terrible report.  I take issue with parts of it.  At the end of the day, we are not England; we are Northern Ireland.  We do not have the same infrastructure.  We are a rural constituency.  Perhaps, if the Minister's Executive colleague had seen fit to extend the A26 through to Coleraine, there might be more of an argument to reduce the services at Causeway, but he did not do so.  Right now, in the position in which we find ourselves, the Donaldson report is not quite applicable to Northern Ireland.</p><p>I agree with Mr Allister that the Minister, up to this point, seems quite enthusiastic about it.  That does give me concern for Causeway, particularly when the Minister was asked about Causeway and his response was that, with a population of 1&#183;8 million, 10 hospitals was not appropriate for Northern Ireland.  That was in response to a question about Causeway, so that makes me think that forefront in the Minister's mind is that the Causeway Hospital is one too many for Northern Ireland.

That means that they can be shifted about to other hospitals.  I hope that the Minister will give his commitment in other ways as well the recent appointments, but I do take that fair point.</p><p>To conclude my contribution to the debate, I ask the Minister to clarify and, again, to reiterate his commitment to the Causeway Hospital with a wee bit more detail.

One of the areas that the report focused on was the responsibility of the political parties to encourage women in politics.  The Northern Ireland Assembly is a party house, and enhancing the participation of women in politics cannot happen without genuine leadership from the political parties &#8212; leadership that goes beyond mechanisms to ensure more women are selected for candidacy and the entire approach of politics.  Today, we are aware of yet another merry dance of old, stale politics between the two main parties.  How many women &#8212; how many women and men &#8212; will become involved in politics because of that?  This House needs to get its act together to stop the rot of people turning off from politics so that we can encourage more young people and women into politics.</p><p>Women need to support women.  I do not like to say that we are the fairer sex because we are much better than that; we are the fantastic sex.  We are fantastic in that we hold ourselves to such high standards.  I heard recently from a woman that females should be concerned only with business and not necessarily how they look.  I say do both if that is what you want to do.  A leader is not necessarily a woman in a suit; it is a woman not afraid to wear a dress and own it.</p><p>Men also need to support women.  I was asked this morning about how my male colleagues treat me in the House, and I must admit that I have not really witnessed much of that nonsense, but, let us face it, that hostility is their insecurity, not mine, so I do not really pay much attention to it anyway.</p><p>My last point is that I will stand here and say that I am a feminist.

I rise on behalf of Sinn F&#233;in to propose the motion.  It is a simple enough motion and I do not think that it should provide any issues for any Member or party in the House.  I think most of the parties will already subscribe to the general intention behind the motion and most, if not all, of its sentiments.  Nevertheless, I will make a few points on the motion.</p><p>The motion, as has been outlined, asks the Assembly to note the reduction in the block grant of &#163;1&#183;5 billion over the last recent number of years.  It further notes the declared intentions of the British Tories to make even more swingeing cuts within the next mandate if re-elected in May.  The Tories, as we all know, have said that they will take a further &#163;30 billion from public spending, which will include, perhaps, &#163;12 billion from welfare.  Who knows precisely what a Labour-led Government may seek to do?  However, that is outside our gift at this time.</p><p>Unfortunately, we already know the devastating impact that this is having on public services and what the impact on the most vulnerable in our society would be if we were to simply pass on the benefit cuts to those most in need.  Those are benefit cuts that the five parties to the Stormont House Agreement have agreed should not be imposed on the most vulnerable, but which will come, obviously, at a cost to the block grant.  All around us, Departments have been forced to cut budgets because of the cuts to our block grant.  We know that all of that is down to an austerity programme and a Tory ideological agenda of assault on spending on public services and cutting benefits to those most in need.  That, of course, drives down wages and makes more profit for big businesses, the friends of the Tories.</p><p>The motion asks all parties in the Assembly to restate their opposition to the austerity policies at the root of all this and to call on any incoming British Government to immediately pursue a policy of economic stimulus.  For Sinn F&#233;in's part, we will continue to oppose austerity as an economic policy, which, by all evidence, is counterproductive to building an economy, certainly any notion of a fair economy.</p><p>I believe that it is important to place on record, particularly for those outside of here who choose to ignore the financial realities that the Executive have to deal with, that the British Government set the block grant.  We have no fiscal powers or levers at our disposal to allow us to stimulate and build our local economy.  Effectively, we are having to manage the block grant as opposed to managing the economy.  Equally, we have a range of very negative indicators, which are additional burdens that our Executive have to take account of.  They include having the highest cost of living; the highest levels of child poverty; some of the most deprived wards; higher levels of unemployment; and, of course, the fact that we are a post-conflict society.</p><p>I commend our Executive for working very hard, despite those problems, to mitigate many of them.  Indeed, the Programme for Government commits us to build the economy and tackle disadvantage.  The Executive and Departments have introduced many measures.  No water charges have been imposed; there is free travel for senior citizens; there are no prescription charges; there are regional and other targeted rates relief initiatives; and there is substantial funding support for education to target areas of greater need etc.  There is a range of other measures, which I do not need to rehearse but which I fully believe show the attempts that each Department has made to address some of the difficulties that many in society have to address in dealing with the austerity programmes and cuts to budgets.</p><p>Despite all of the controversy around welfare cuts, the Executive, to their credit, have agreed to not simply impose the benefit cuts, as demanded by the British Government.  I acknowledge that the Executive and Departments have had to face very hard choices, and most have made great efforts to minimise the impact of reduced spending, although it is fair to say that not all decisions have been universally welcomed or even supported.  I also want to put on the record the experience that I have had with the Minister who I have most direct engagement with, the Minister for Social Development.  He personally and his Department have done their best to protect neighbourhood renewal areas and projects, in particular, from the massive cuts being imposed across the board.</p><p>The motion calls on the Executive to continue to defend the crucial public services of health and education, particularly as, clearly, they are essential elements of any caring society.  As I said, I fully understand the concerns in many of our sectors.  I am certain that our Executive can always do some things better, but the motion makes an important appeal to civic society in general, and to employers, trade unions and the community and voluntary sector specifically, to unite in lobbying the British Government against these austerity policies and the massive cuts to the block grant, because that is where the full responsibility for the cuts to the budgets lies.</p><p>As I said earlier, we effectively have to manage the block grant with our hands tied behind our back, because we cannot manage the economy without the powers to do so.  We call on those in wider civic society to unite behind the parties here that have been doing their level best to tackle the austerity programme that has been imposed upon us and the swingeing cuts that have come as a result of those punitive policies.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Block Grant"}, {"date": "2015-04-13", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.

First, I apologise to the Chairperson of the Committee for not being able to be in the Chamber when he made his opening remarks on the report.  I thank him for having the report tabled this morning.  I speak as a member of the Committee and as Chairperson of the Social Development Committee.</p><p>I welcome the work that the Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Nesbitt, has undertaken with regard to the scrutiny of the European Union policies, priorities and so on.  As I said, I thank the Chairperson for his management of the process.</p><p>Obviously, a lot of people, regardless of their views on Europe, fully understand that we are very much linked, not least economically, but in political ways.  The Member who has just spoken indicated his views, but no matter what our views are, we understand that we have very, very clear and important links.</p><p>It is fair to say, on behalf of the Social Development Committee, that we have not focused entirely on the European issues that relate to our remit.  That is primarily because our priorities have been lying elsewhere in recent times.  However, the Committee is very aware that we have important work to do in terms of the broader community and voluntary sector, which the Committee has a very important relationship with and on which these European matters very much impinge, particularly where you have a reduction in the budget.  So, the Committee has already agreed to take a briefing from the Department for Social Development before the summer recess so that we can recalibrate our priority programme for work in the time ahead.</p><p>Many people tend to think merely of how much money we can draw down from Europe for particular projects.  That is very important in its own right, but I think more of us have to think more strategically.  I will give a couple of examples.  We have often talked about social housing, for example, as a current priority for all of us.  The provision of social housing is a major issue for us all, and demand continues to considerably outstrip supply.  Meeting that demand requires major investment.  As a matter of fact, the Committee notes that the European Investment Bank (EIB) aims to invest &#163;1 billion to tackle the lack of affordable housing in the UK.  Indeed, in February, the EIB gave, I think, &#163;350 million &#8212; essentially a 30-year loan &#8212; to one of Britain's biggest social housing landlords, the Sanctuary Group.  Interestingly, in terms of scale, that group has around 96,000 properties.  It will use the money and the 30-year loan to build new homes, refurbish existing homes and regenerate run-down areas &#8212; something that we are all very keen to see happening here in respect of the future for social housing provision in the North.  The Committee will investigate with the Department and other stakeholders whether the EIB can play a role in assisting with our investment need to address social housing demands.</p><p>Similarly, the Committee is interested in exploring the opportunities provided by the European social fund (ESF) that will enable social enterprises, and the third sector in particular, to develop new services and markets for communities.  In doing so, in terms of policy, we will look at the best practices at home and abroad to underpin the development of that sector which is very, very important for all of us, given the links that it has with the grass roots of hard-pressed communities in particular.  So, clearly, the ESF has an important role.</p><p>We note, and place on record our disappointment at, the number of organisations that have lost very important amounts of money very recently.  In some cases, those losses have led to the closure of key projects.  Clearly, the Social Development Committee has indicated its intention to play a much more focused role in scrutinising European priorities and policies and to look at what we can do to work with the Department and those in the community and voluntary sector in particular to see if we can maximise the drawdown on a strategic basis to, first, underpin the community and voluntary sector, which is a very important element of our civic society's structures, and, secondly, and I suppose more importantly, to make sure that we are able to draw down those resources to tackle poverty by including social inclusion at the heart of all the work that we are involved in.</p><p>Again, I thank the Chairperson for tabling the report this morning.  Hopefully, it will provide a lot of food for thought for all of us.  I reiterate that the Social Development Committee has already agreed with the Department to have another look at the European priorities.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Committee Business: European Scrutiny Priorities 2015"}, {"date": "2015-03-24", "body": "<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.

Notwithstanding that effort, the Committee received only three substantive written submissions to the call for evidence, as well as three email responses.</p><p>Throughout its consideration, the Committee took oral evidence from the three stakeholders that provided substantive written submissions, and regular written and oral briefings from the Department.  The Committee welcomed the Department's proactive approach in addressing in a timely and comprehensive fashion the issues raised by stakeholders and for providing detailed briefings on these matters.  I place on record the Committee's thanks to departmental officials who attended each evidence session and were, therefore, able to give almost simultaneous responses to questions and concerns raised by stakeholders.</p><p>The Committee's report outlines a range of issues raised by the Committee and addressed by the Department.  Therefore, I intend to confine my remarks to the key issues raised by stakeholders and the related recommendations made by the Committee.</p><p>Members will note the inclusion in the Bill of changes to bereavement benefits.  I thank Cruse Bereavement Care and the Childhood Bereavement Network for providing evidence to the Committee about the introduction of the bereavement support payment.  Cruse expressed concern at the replacement of a number of benefits, including widowed parent's allowance, with a single bereavement payment and the likely impact of that on widowed parents with dependent children.  The Committee recommends that the Department monitors the impact on widowed parents with dependent children as a result of replacing widowed parent's allowance and other bereavement benefits with a single bereavement support payment.</p><p>The Committee noted that the bereavement support payment will not extend to surviving unmarried cohabiting partners, which is also the case with the payment of widowed parent's allowance.  It noted that the main stated reason for that is the difficulty in officially verifying such relationships.  However, the Committee shares the concerns of Cruse and the Childhood Bereavement Network that that might impact negatively on the children of such a relationship.  It therefore recommends that the Department investigates how verification of such relationships can be established with a view to providing access for the surviving partner of such a relationship to the bereavement support payment.</p><p>The Committee was concerned that those with multiple part-time jobs or in zero-hours contracts might struggle to make the lower earnings limit required to trigger National Insurance contributions and, therefore, not reach the minimum qualifying period of 10 years' contributions to ensure a state pension.  That issue was also raised by the Commissioner for Older People when giving evidence to the Committee.</p><p>The Department noted that National Insurance was an excepted matter and, therefore, fell outside the remit of the Assembly.  However, the Committee was informed that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and HMRC were looking at this matter for the longer term.  The Committee noted that the number of people who fell into this category was likely to be very low.  According to the most recent figures, for 2012-13, only 110 people who put in a claim were getting a pension of less than the 10-year amount.</p><p>The Committee recommends that the Department provides an update when HMRC and DWP make progress towards effectively capturing information on those with multiple jobs and struggling to reach the lower earnings limit to ensure, in the context of this Bill, recognition of their service to society and that qualifying years can be accumulated accordingly.</p><p>The Committee highlighted the importance of making sure that informal carers received formal credit for their work that might otherwise go unrecognised, for example the carers' allowance, to ensure that that contributes to the number of qualifying years.  The Committee noted that an officially recognised carer could potentially obtain a full state pension depending on the duration of their caring responsibilities.  It therefore calls on the Department for Social Development to work with stakeholders and other Departments, particularly DHSSPS, to maximise the number of informal carers officially recognised as carers to ensure that they receive an appropriate level of state pension.</p><p>On behalf of the Committee, I welcome the introduction of a single-tier pension.  It provides simplicity in an otherwise complex area.  It also provides greater certainty in respect of what an individual can expect to receive on retirement.  It is, and has been, described as a mixed bag and is, of course, part of ongoing wider changes and reform of pension provision.</p><p>I hope that I have given a fair reflection, a Cheann Comhairle, of the Committee's concerns on the broader issues, and I thank you for the latitude you gave me to do so.  On behalf of the Committee for Social Development, I support the amendments and passage of the Bill.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Executive Committee Business: Pensions Bill: Consideration Stage"}, {"date": "2015-03-23", "body": "<p>T10.

The good news for the Minister is that, when we get the rates revaluations wrong, it is usually the small businesses that come to the Committee first to voice their concern and anger about non-domestic rates.  Already, we have had some small businesses, especially petrol stations, come to our Committee because they are concerned that they maybe carry too great a burden at this time.  That said, we have made a decision as a Committee to try to collate the evidence, bring it forward, try to have quicker revaluations and try to respond to the complaints and concerns of, in particular, non-domestic ratepayers in businesses and small businesses.</p><p>A series of reliefs for businesses and manufacturing businesses already exists.  We need to avoid the situation that was created, especially in places like Belfast city centre, where the rates bill became so onerous that businesses no longer wanted to locate there and moved.

People are now able to estimate what their rent and rates will be, decide whether they can afford it and bring businesses back to the city centre.  As the burden is spread, I hope that the scale of the rates increase in other areas of Belfast city does not make business there untenable.  I think in particular of the Cathedral Quarter, where there has been an increase.  I hope that the businesses continue to flourish in the time ahead.</p><p>As we adopt the motion today, the main thing is that we need to return more swiftly to look at the effect of the rates and rates increases on business in the time ahead.

Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and my thanks to everyone from all the parties who took part in the debate.  The debate was on alternative or extra ways to raise revenues, but it turned into quite an existential debate on where we are in political and constitutional terms.</p><p>We should not lose sight of the fact that Daith&#237; Mc Kay for Sinn F&#233;in set out some areas where we think there could be changes and other areas where we think we should start an urgent debate.  In particular, we have identified removing the cap on rates on homes above &#163;400,000, and we think that we can do that without putting anyone who is asset-rich and cash-poor into added difficulties.  We also looked at the Scottish model and at what we can learn from that.</p><p>Putting that to the side, there were slim pickings from the other parties on additional means to raise revenue.  That said, I think that the debate was worthwhile, because it is certainly useful for the House to look at the block grant, at the subvention and at where the money is and is not.  I am a great admirer of my colleague on the Committee for Finance and Personnel Mr Girvan, who said in the kindest terms possible that the Treasury sometimes keeps us in the dark about what money is being raised here.  That is undoubtedly true.  There is certainly a lack of transparency and trust in the figures that the Treasury provides us with, and I think that we need to do better on that.  We also need to do better when we discuss the block grant and what the Finance Minister, Mr Hamilton, refers to as the &#163;10 billion gap.  We need to look at that carefully as well.</p><p>I spent the weekend on a treasure hunt for the &#163;10 billion, and our colleagues in the research department gave me a certain amount of help with that.  When we look at what makes up the gap, we find that there are items that make little or no difference to the ordinary people and constituents we serve.  In particular, &#163;1 billion of that &#163;10 billion is debt.  Another &#163;1 billion-plus is what the Treasury refers to as \"defence\", and defence and debt are, of course, closely linked in this day and age.  We owe it to our constituents to drill down and to question the Treasury on what we raise and what it says is part of the subvention and block grant for this part of the world.</p><p>That goes to the core of the debate that we have in the Finance Committee weekly: the need to understand where we are today and how we can increase and enhance our firepower and spending power in the time ahead.</p><p>There have been suggestions that some of the smaller parties support water charges and the removal of free travel; both large parties are against that.  We stand four-square against the introduction of water charges, and we stand against the removal of free travel.  That remains our position.  However, we should not be paralysed from looking at other ways of raising revenue.</p><p>One thing that surprised me was the Minister, last week in the Chamber, referring to this Parliament as a toddler and the Scottish Parliament as being in its first year at primary school or at kindergarten.  I am wholly opposed to such language; it seems to be the type of language that will be music to the ears of English Ministers.  In my view, we are as capable of running our affairs as those same English Ministers.</p><p>There is a very famous book by Senator Jim Webb on the fighting Irish.  It is not about the fighting Irish; it is about the fighting Ulster Scots in America.  When we go into negotiations with the Treasury, I would like to see not only the Ulster-Scots work ethic but the character, resilience and determination to stand up for our constituents and voters to make sure that we get a fair deal so that we can build an economy that is fair and prosperous.</p><p>I think that Mr Cree was afraid that we were going to lead him into the Republic today, because he went back to 1969 and the crossroads; Ms Boyle's crossroads, of course, but your crossroads and Mr O'Neill's crossroads as well.  That encouraged your leader to go back 100 years to what might have been a golden era, but, as Mr McCann pointed out, not everyone shared in that golden era.</p><p>I think that we can look confidently to the future, but that makes it incumbent upon all of us to look critically at the links with Britain and this dependency, as it is, on a block grant.</p><p>Mr McCann alluded to this:  there are two sides to this coin.  Tomorrow, at the economy Committee, we will discuss underinvestment in water and sewerage and in the road network.  Of course, parts of the North of Ireland have been constantly left outside of economic prosperity and development.  We think of the north-west &#8212; that debate continues today &#8212; and north and west Belfast.  Mr McQuillan referenced west Belfast and south Armagh, but, of course, west Belfast is more than just the Falls Road and Ballymurphy; it is also the Shankill Road, as he will appreciate.  That is why I think we can do better than go by what happened heretofore:  to depend absolutely and entirely on the block grant, bring no innovative thinking to that and bring no assertive or confident approach to how we can better run our own affairs.  So, where some see English altruism or the altruism of English Ministers, I take a wholly different view.  Often, we hear from Scotland, and others, that even as London surges ahead, the decisions taken in London are to our benefit.  We are constantly assured of that.  I do not think that that holds.</p><p>Minister Hamilton mentioned some possible Barnett consequentials that may derive from increased expenditure on health and education if that happens.  I also read the news.  The spending promises and decisions of recent days will make no difference to our constituents.  Three billion pounds on a new aircraft carrier; &#163;20 billion on a new generation of fighter jets.  Where are the benefits of that spending to us?  Of course, that would be part of the magic &#163;20 billion subvention that we are told we get.</p><p>Sadly, austerity remains top of the Tory coalition's agenda.  For us, austerity spells only further misery for the poor and for working people; it is not the solution to our economic progress.  We need investment, not more cuts, to bring progress.  The Minister told us again today that we have lost &#163;1&#183;5 billion from the block grant since 2010-11 and that we stand to lose another &#163;1 billion between now and 2020.  Such decisions only hold us back; they do not give us the impetus that we need to push into the future.</p><p>I move now to the Alliance amendment.  My colleagues Ms Cochrane and Mr Lyttle cut out the most important statement in the Sinn F&#233;in motion, which is that we support the 2015-16 Budget.  You cannot have your cake and eat it.  You are opposed to the Budget; the alternative to the Budget was the horror story that would be direct rule.  When you come forward with ideas for revenue raising, and no one has a monopoly on those, we will take them on board.

I take it that he accepts that we would like more transparency in Treasury figures.

We know that it is suffering under a 20% VAT rate and is asking for some flexibility.  That surely is an area in which, if we had the fiscal lever, we could decide whether to pull the metaphorical trigger.</p><p>Do you think that we need more transparency?

You have been here for quite a while now, like me, but congratulations on your appointment.</p><p>I want to touch on matters that would, perhaps, enhance the Budget on the basis that we have many pressing demands on our funds.  When I last looked, the Minister had managed to put over &#163;40 million into the new investment fund.  Perhaps that has increased in the last seven days.  I would ask him to explore, as part of the growth of the investment fund, the opportunity to attract funds from abroad.  I am thinking in particular of pension funds, which would see an investment fund in this region as an attractive proposition.  Of course, that would mean a loan that would have to be paid back, but I believe that the rates would be favourable and that it would give us that extra \"za-za boom\", I believe they call it; that extra push in our investment programme.</p><p>When the Minister was in kindergarten in 1995, there was talk of a peace bond.  The Minister does not have the power to issue a bond, but we need to explore in an imaginative fashion how we could work towards a bond if we had the powers.  However, it would certainly give our allies and friends across the globe, but particularly in north America, an opportunity to invest in building the peace and the economy.</p><p>The baby sister of the investment fund is the social innovation fund, which has only &#163;5 million from dormant funds but hopefully will grow.  Again, I ask the Minister to look beyond making that a fund from which voluntary, charitable or faith group bodies can borrow.  Is there a way to match funds that are contributed by philanthropists?  I am thinking particularly of the Community First programme in England, which runs until the end of March this year.  The Treasury set aside &#163;50 million and said that, if those with wealth came forward and wished to establish a fund, it would match it.  If a generous individual came forward in Bristol, Manchester or London and said, \"I wish to have a new fund with &#163;1 million\", the Government came forward with their kitty and matched that.</p><p>We know of the great work that the Community Foundation here does in making sure that funds that are donated by philanthropists are distributed to those in need and agencies that are tackling poverty and building the social economy.  That may be something that we should do as well.  There are other bodies and agencies that lend to voluntary and charitable groups, enterprise agencies and so on, but at this stage we do not, to my knowledge, have a scheme whereby if someone wished to contribute, perhaps to their local area, they could come forward with funds and we would match them.  Through the social innovation fund, the Minister might look at that.</p><p>There is an organisation in the US called the Calvert Foundation.  It asks individuals to lend it funds and it distributes those, usually to inner cities.</p><p>The Calvert Foundation model could be used around our peace lines.  People who want to support the peace and build the economy could make small donations to our social innovation fund, have them matched by the Minister and see their money contribute to building peace.</p><p>Lastly, I want to echo the comments of Mr Eastwood.  It always stops you talking when your name is mentioned.  I echo his calls.  I made it up to the city that I call \"Derry\", the Minister calls \"Londonderry\" and my esteemed colleague Ms Boyle refers to as \"Greater Strabane\".  I was in Derry city last week, where I met representatives of the chamber of commerce and Ilex and the new CEO of Derry City and Strabane District Council.  I make a plea to all the parties here:  in the next Programme for Government, we really need to get our act together on the north-west; we need to expand Magee College and create the infrastructure.  The potential with corporation tax powers is limitless.  We could move into a new era of job creation, and, as part of that new era, there needs to be a new peace dividend and a new era for the north-west.

Tr&#225;thn&#243;na maith.  Ba mhaith liom misneach mhic l&#233;inn Chol&#225;iste Naomh Muire a mholadh agus m&#233; ag cur achain&#237; os do chomhair.  I present to you, Mr Speaker, a petition from the students and community of west Belfast on, as it was at the time, the planned closure of St Mary's University College.  The students asked a representative from South Belfast to present the petition to show solidarity and to send their best wishes to Stranmillis University College.  Of course, as we know, both university colleges were threatened with closure at that time.</p><p>I am happy to present the petition, and I want to say some words of praise for the students.  In this day and age, we often hear people say that our young people are not engaged enough in civic or political life, and, with their leadership of this campaign, I think that they showed exactly the opposite.  They rose to the challenge, and we owe them a debt of gratitude.</p><p>I am aware that circumstances have changed since the petition was first circulated and won the support of people well beyond the confines of St Mary's University College.  I will only say that, as we look to the future, I think that you will find in these students who led the campaign great allies as we start to discuss and continue discussing a shared and pluralist approach to further and higher education.  Ba mhaith liom sin a bheith r&#225;ite, agus go nd&#233;anaimid uilig comhghairdeas leis na mic l&#233;inn.</p><p>To finish, I know that the Minister met the students, and I think that he will find that they are progressive and ambitious and have high aspirations for themselves, their community and this society.  I believe that, in the time ahead, they will continue to engage with him in this debate about saving the university colleges and ensuring that they prosper.  My only word of advice for the Minister is to bring a bouquet to that discussion, rather than a metaphorical blunderbuss.</p><p class=\"italic\">Mr &#211; Muilleoir moved forward and laid the petition on the Table.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Assembly Business: St Mary's University College: Public Petition"}], "title": "", "house": "3", "lastupdate": "2014-12-16 17:25:02", "person_id": "25256", "entered_reason": "appointed", "full_name": "M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Muilleoir", "member_id": "90496", "entered_house": "2014-11-04", "party": "Sinn F\u00e9in", "constituency": "Belfast South"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Mitchel", "last_name": "McLaughlin", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>The Member has an extra minute.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>The Member's time is up.</p>", "theme": "Northern Ireland Assembly: Private Members' Business: Water Rates"}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "body": "<p>The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately after the lunchtime suspension today.
