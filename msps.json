[[{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Alex", "last_name": "Neil", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>Last week, Malcolm Chisholm asked for a statement on the consequences for the national health service of yes and no votes in next month&#8217;s referendum. As I said last week, I am happy to oblige.</p><p>In short, the people of Scotland have a choice between two futures: one in which this nation&#8217;s vast wealth can be marshalled to help to create a fairer society; and one in which the budgets that are available for Scotland&#8217;s public services are consigned to the whim of Westminster.</p><p>Nye Bevan&#8217;s founding principles for the national health service were that the institution should be owned by the people and should give access to the highest attainable standard of health services, which would be free at the point of delivery and based on clinical need and not ability to pay.</p><p>Those principles must be protected, and a yes vote gives this nation a chance to do just that by framing a constitution that reflects the values and aspirations of our nation. As the First Minister set out last week, we will take to the independent constitutional convention a proposal to enshrine the national health service as an institution in the constitution. That would ensure that, in contrast to what is happening south of the border, our health service could never be privatised against the wishes of the people. I note that all members of this Parliament say that they do not favour privatisation, so I trust that after a yes vote they will join us in the constitutional convention in making the case for constitutional protection for the national health service.</p><p>Scotland is a wealthy nation. We do not need to limit our ambitions to the parameters of the Barnett consequentials. With the full powers of independence, the Scottish Government could do yet more to strengthen our economy, create more jobs and make the transformational investment that would help thousands of people back into work. More people in work is not just good for the economy but essential to improving the nation&#8217;s health.</p><p>A no vote is a very different and disturbing prospect for our national health service and wider public services. Under the current arrangements, every &#163;10 that is cut from health spending in England through austerity, privatisation and patient charges will consequently reduce Scotland&#8217;s budget by around &#163;1. Privatisation that leads to further patient charges, enabled by the Health and Social Care Act 2012 in England, means that services that were previously free will have to be paid for by patients. The replacement of public funding with private money will have a consequential impact on Scotland&#8217;s budget.</p><p>We should be in no doubt: a reduction in free services in England and extended charging for health services are exactly what is happening and will continue to happen in England. As Unite the union has warned:</p><p>&#8220;the public will increasingly have to pay for aspects of their care that used to be free at the time of treatment.&#8221;</p><p>The Labour Party in England shares that concern. It said in its publication, &#8220;The Choice: NHS&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;there is the prospect of more NHS services being charged for, and fewer services being provided free at the point of need.&#8221;</p><p>That is also the view of the Labour Party in Wales, where my opposite number, the Labour health minister Mark Drakeford, said:</p><p>&#8220;The fundamental issue ... is the impact on public services in Wales of the cuts being made by&#8221;</p><p>the</p><p>&#8220;administration in Westminster, and passed down to Wales. That is what the fundamental problem is here: we have a Westminster Government that believes in shrinking the state, which believes in doing less through the public realm, and passes less money down to us in order to be able to do it.&#8221;&#8212;[Record of Proceedings, National Assembly for Wales, 17 June 2014.]</p><p>Labour&#8217;s English health spokesman, Andy Burnham, has given the same signal. He warned:</p><p>&#8220;Five more years of the same would push the NHS off the cliff-edge where it now finds itself.&#8221;</p><p>Andy Burnham has also said that the coalition</p><p>&#8220;sees no limits on the extent of privatisation in the NHS.&#8221;</p><p>Here in Scotland, however, Labour members would have us believe that their colleagues in England and Wales are wrong and that there will be no impact from the austerity, privatisation and charging agenda of the current Westminster Government. Of course, that was not always the case. In 2009, the warning from Labour in Scotland was that the Tories were</p><p>&#8220;relishing the chance to swing the axe at the public services millions rely on&#8221;,</p><p>with &#8220;Cuts driven by ideology&#8221;. That warning came from one Alistair Darling.</p><p>Strangely, this morning, Alistair Darling defended Osborne&#8217;s budgets on the radio and claimed that national health service spending in England has been</p><p>&#8220;increasing for the last four years under the present Government&#8221;.</p><p>However, in 2012, Andy Burnham warned that the Conservatives had</p><p>&#8220;cut the NHS budget for two years running&#8221;</p><p>and that they owe it</p><p>&#8220;to patients and NHS staff to be honest about that.&#8221;</p><p>In the 2010 election, Scottish Labour&#8217;s election campaign broadcast, upon which Mr Darling and all Labour members of Parliament were elected, said that the Tories had</p><p>&#8220;starved our schools and hospitals of funding and there&#8217;s a real risk they would do the same again.&#8221;</p><p>Even after the Conservatives took office, Labour warned again:</p><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going to happen when David Cameron&#8217;s cuts start to hit? Scotland is worried and they are right to be worried.&#8221;</p><p>So said Iain Gray. This year, Labour MP Michael Meacher has gone further still on the future of the health service in England, saying</p><p>&#8220;we know the latest steps being proposed to make the NHS into a full-blown private health service&#8221;&#8212;[Interruption.]</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>Mr Meacher continued:</p><p>&#8220;the truth has been let out of the bag that the Tories and their big corporate friends had in fact intended all along that it would become a fully paid-for service, only they didn&#8217;t dare say so before now.&#8221;</p><p>Perhaps the no campaign would have us believe that, despite the warnings of the Labour Party in England, Labour in Wales, the Jarrow marchers and myriad warnings from trade unions, the Tories are actually privatising the health service in order to increase public spending. As Mark Drakeford outlined, we already know that the Tories&#8217; spending plans are for yet deeper cuts. Ed Balls has pledged to keep Labour within the Tory spending plans and George Osborne has pledged to force through another &#163;25&#160;billion-worth of cuts.</p><p>Since 2010, when the coalition came to office, we have already had a 7.2 per cent cut in real terms to our resource budget, plus a 26 per cent cut in our capital budget. Despite those cuts, the Scottish National Party Government has managed to protect the front-line resource NHS budget in Scotland and, in each year since 2010, we have increased it above real terms. I do not think that anyone in the chamber can think it a realistic prospect that, if further deep cuts through austerity are forced on Scotland by Westminster, services will be left unscathed.</p><p>The solution that the no campaign proposes is that taxes should be hiked in Scotland to offset the planned Tory cuts. That is unacceptable and would be a double whammy for Scotland. That is why a no vote would put our health service at serious risk. The consequences of a no vote would be reduced budgets as a result of privatisation, patient charges, fragmented pay arrangements for health staff, with further pay restrictions, and austerity as a matter of ideology south of the border.</p><p>That is why we on this side of the chamber choose the path where the power and wealth of Scotland are put in the hands of the people of Scotland. We choose a future where Nye Bevan&#8217;s founding principles for the health service are not simple articles of aspiration but part of our constitution. We choose to ensure that those who come after us can have the guarantee of a health service that is free at the point of need, just as we and our families have benefited from that throughout our lives. We invite the people of Scotland to choose that path with us. The first step is simple&#8212;vote yes for independence on 18 September.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>In the spirit of Mr Findlay&#8217;s remarks, I thank him for the compliment at the start of his question.</p><p>I do not think that Mr Findlay understands what devolution means. Let me remind him that Enoch Powell said many years ago that power devolved is power retained. We must look at not only today and tomorrow but at five and 10 years&#8217; time. With a constitution that embeds and enshrines the basic principles of the national health service, Scotland will never ever have a privatised health service. Our powers in a devolved Parliament are not enshrined and can be overruled at any time by any future Westminster Government.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>As far as the money is concerned&#8212;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>The biggest problem that I have financially is that the previous Labour Administration left us a legacy of a bill for &#163;220&#160;million every year for its private finance initiative.

I tell him that the nurses and other agenda for change workers in the national health service were refused, by his Government, the pay increase that was recommended by their pay review body not just for this year but for next year. They do not have an increase this year or next year.</p><p>We implemented the recommendations, with a view to reviewing them in a year&#8217;s time, as normal. However, nurses down south have been treated with contempt by the Secretary of State for Health down there, so I do not think that we will take any lessons about what is promised and said by a Tory Government in London. No nurse in England would believe anything that the Tories said about the health service.</p><p>As far as the money is concerned, the reason why we are spending so much additional money on the health service is because the SNP Government has ring fenced the money for health, while Mr Carlaw&#8217;s Government has cut our resource budget by 7.5 per cent and our capital budget by 26 per cent. Over the past five years, Scotland&#8217;s &#163;8&#160;billion advantage has been taken down to London to subsidise the Treasury down there. If we had had access to our own &#163;8&#160;billion over those years, the increase in spending on public services would have been a lot higher.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>Depending on where the Westminster axe on public spending falls, by 2018-19, if the further threatened cuts are implemented, Scotland&#8217;s budget will be cut in real terms by between &#163;4&#160;billion and &#163;5&#160;billion, compared with the position when the coalition Government came to office. That represents cuts of between 14.6 per cent and 18.3 per cent. The worst-cast scenario is the frontline Scottish resource budget being cut in real terms from &#163;27.3&#160;billion in 2010-11 to &#163;22.3&#160;billion in 2018-19. To put that in terms that the no campaign might understand, it is more than the entire schools budget for Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>As I have already said, the biggest amount of NHS money that goes to the private sector in Scotland is the &#163;220&#160;million in PFI charges. In five out of the six years for which final figures are available since we came to power, we have spent less on the private sector in Scotland as a percentage of our total budget than the Labour Administration before us did.</p><p>I also remind the member&#8212;because maybe she has a short memory&#8212;that it was not this Government that tried to privatise Stracathro. I think that it was her Government that tried to privatise services at Stracathro, and it took Nicola Sturgeon to reverse that privatisation and keep Stracathro in the public sector.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>There are two ways. First, when we are independent we will get the Government that we elect, and I do not think that any Scottish Government will ever dare to try to privatise the health service in Scotland. We saw the price that the Labour Party paid in 2007 when it tried a bit of privatisation in Stracathro and in Harthill in my constituency.</p><p>The second way to absolutely guarantee that is to write the founding principles of the national health service into an independent Scotland&#8217;s constitution and build it into the ethos of this Parliament so that nobody&#8212;by accident or by design&#8212;can privatise our health service.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>What I would be ashamed about would be my party shoring up the Tories and the privatisation agenda, like Mr Rennie&#8217;s is.

If anybody should be holding their head in shame, it is Mr Rennie.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>Of course, the public spending cuts were started by Alistair Darling when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, so I can understand why he is defending Tory cuts, although in that interview he seemed to be facing at least two ways. In fact, after the interview I began to think that he had more faces than Big Ben.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>The last part of that question was just totally factually incorrect. On the impact of charges, privatisation is about imposing charges on services that previously were free of charge. If a service is paid for through charges instead of taxation, which is the direction of travel down south, the amount of revenue through time that is spent on the national health service will decline, because the revenue will come from the charges. If the revenue declines, if we stay under the Barnett formula through time our revenue and our budget will decline as well.</p><p>Let me quote from a survey of the leading health and social care professionals in England, which was undertaken on 1 July 2014 by the Nuffield Trust, a highly respected organisation. The survey asked:</p><p>&#8220;How likely do you think it is that comprehensive health care (excluding charges that already apply), will still be provided free at the point of use in England in ten years&#8217; time?&#8221;</p><p>The answer from 47 per cent was &#8220;Quite unlikely&#8221; or &#8220;Very unlikely&#8221;. They believe that charges are coming in England and they are the leading professionals in the health and social care system in England. They are politically independent.

I make it absolutely clear that, irrespective of the result of the referendum, the cross-border arrangements between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom&#8212;and indeed the cross-border arrangements between Scotland, the rest of the United Kingdom and the European Union, which are covered by a cross-border directive&#8212;will all continue. Beyond that, we quite regularly send patients as far away as the United States if they require very specialist treatment. That will continue as well.</p><p>It is two-way traffic. In a typical year, as well as us sending patients outwith Scotland to get specialist treatment, about 7,500 people come to Scotland for very specialist treatment that they cannot get anywhere else.

That is happening here and now, and we can be proud of it.</p><p>I thank the Scottish Government for bringing today&#8217;s debate. It is important to go back to first principles. Inherent in the Labour amendment and Jackie Baillie&#8217;s contribution is the idea that Scotland is somehow a basket case and cannot afford to provide a decent and fair social security system. Jackie Baillie&#8217;s speech today was matched by her line of questioning at yesterday&#8217;s Welfare Reform Committee meeting: no welcome for the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to abolishing the bedroom tax; no welcome for its commitment to bringing carers allowance up to the same level as jobseekers allowance or for the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s commitment to doing more for carers beyond that; and no welcome for the commitment to replacing the work capability assessment with a fairer system.</p><p>The affordability of our social security system is undeniably important, but so are ambition, vision and the determination to do better. I did not get that sense of drive from Ms Baillie&#8217;s speech today. We know that</p><p>&#8220;In 2012-13, 42.3% of Scottish tax revenues were spent on welfare and pensions (social protection), compared with 43% for the UK as a whole.&#8221;</p><p>and we know that</p><p>&#8220;Spending on social protection as a share of gross domestic output ... has been lower in Scotland than in the UK in each of the past five years.&#8221;</p><p>So, we know that Scotland can afford a better system&#8212;which point was made by the independent expert group on welfare.</p><p>I turn to the report that the Scottish Government published today on the impact of welfare reform on disabled people. I think that the findings of the report tally largely with the report that Sheffield Hallam University prepared for the Welfare Reform Committee. The Scottish Government&#8217;s report states:</p><p>&#8220;Of the 190,000 existing DLA claimants in Scotland who will be reassessed for PIP, it is expected that around 105,000 working-age disabled people will lose some or all their disability benefits by 2018, with a loss of at least &#163;1,120 per year.&#8221;</p><p>That is an absolute disgrace in 21st century Scotland.</p><p>I heard Alex Johnstone on &#8220;Good Morning Scotland&#8221; this morning on disability benefits. He said:</p><p>&#8220;The headline budget for this will actually increase, it won&#8217;t reduce.&#8221;</p><p>He also said:</p><p>&#8220;This is not about reducing budgets.&#8221;</p><p>He needs to tell the Treasury that, because its 2013 budget document estimates a reduced spend due to disability living allowance reform of nearly &#163;3&#160;billion a year by 2017-18, with Scottish disabled people being expected to shoulder around &#163;310&#160;million of that by 2017-18.</p><p>I will return to the point that Annabelle Ewing made earlier. Inclusion Scotland says that the motivation behind the replacement of DLA with PIP has been about cutting the welfare budget. I say to Mr Johnstone that that is what people are saying, so I think that he needs to take that on board.</p><p>Food banks have been mentioned in the debate. Citizens Advice Scotland tells us that</p><p>&#8220;Between January and March 2014 citizens advice bureaux in Scotland recorded 1,311 new food parcel issues&#8212;this equates to one food parcel issue for every 50 clients who received advice.&#8221;</p><p>Oxfam Scotland, which Alex Rowley mentioned, reminds us that</p><p>&#8220;In Scotland the Trussell Trust distributed 640,000 meals last year&#8212;a fivefold increase on the previous year. Large rises are also reported by other providers&#8221;.</p><p>Oxfam also said:</p><p>&#8220;The evidence clearly shows that changes to the welfare system are a significant driver of rising foodbank use.&#8221;</p><p>It was therefore not without some sense of incredulity that I read the comments of better together Aberdeenshire, which Kevin Stewart and Annabelle Ewing mentioned. I will read out what it said:</p><p>&#8220;Far from being a sign of failure&#8221;,</p><p>food banks</p><p>&#8220;are an enriching example of human compassion, faith and social cohesion.&#8221;</p><p>Undoubtedly, they are a sign of human compassion in terms of the compassion of those who give up so much of their time to help others, and for many of them it is a sign of their faith as well. However, the idea that food banks are a sign of &#8220;social cohesion&#8221; rather than a &#8220;sign of failure&#8221; is something that, frankly, no one with their head screwed on could recognise to be the case. The better together Aberdeenshire group also said that to raise the issue of food banks</p><p>&#8220;insults the thousands of people who contribute, who run and who use&#8221;</p><p>them.</p><p>Let us hear what those who run food banks say.

Does the minister share my disappointment that Labour-run North Lanarkshire Council refused to back that policy, going so far as to vote against the motion to support the policy that was lodged by the Scottish National Party councillors in North Lanarkshire?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Schools (Protection from Closure)"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>Last week, we debated the changes to the written agreement between the Finance Committee and the Scottish Government on the budget process, which were made necessary by the devolution of two taxes. The land and buildings transaction tax and the Scottish landfill tax will be an important consideration in budget setting and budget scrutiny. The Scottish Government will publish its forecasts for the revenue that will be raised by those newly devolved taxes, so it is vital that we have a body that can scrutinise those forecasts. That will be the role of the fiscal commission, which we are debating today.</p><p>The fiscal commission will only fulfil its role as well as its personnel allow it to. In that regard, I want to endorse the cabinet secretary&#8217;s three nominees. Susan Rice, the prospective chair of the commission, has worked in a range of senior roles in the banking sector since 1986. Before that, she worked in academic management in America, and she is currently a non-executive director on the court of the Bank of England, as well as undertaking a range of other work. In the evidence that she gave to the Finance Committee, I was struck by the depth of her commitment to the concept of public service, which too many people overlook or are quick to dismiss in an increasingly cynical age. I believe that she is committed to the commission for the best of reasons, and I believe that she will be an effective and engaging chairperson.</p><p>Andrew Hughes Hallett and Campbell Leith are two eminent economists with different but complementary backgrounds, and both will be excellent appointments to work with Susan Rice on the commission.</p><p>It is unfortunate that some members believe that two of the nominees face a conflict of interests by virtue of their role on the Council of Economic Advisers, but I do not consider that to be the case. First, I observe that the Finance Committee took considerable time to prepare a report on the establishment of a Scottish fiscal commission and that nowhere in that report did we make a recommendation that restrictions should be imposed on who could be appointed to the commission on the basis of their membership of another entity.</p><p>Secondly, I believe that, in the evidence that they gave to the committee, all three nominees not only gave an undertaking that they would act independently; they demanded that their independence be respected. I think that we should take that in good faith.</p><p>Thirdly, we should recognise that, by virtue of their expertise, all three nominees are bound to be in demand to sit on other bodies. The perception of a conflict of interest might always be there, but that does not mean that there is one.</p><p>We should also recognise that the fiscal commission will have a very different role from that of the Council of Economic Advisers. I thought that Malcolm Chisholm slightly misinterpreted the cabinet secretary&#8212;who I am sure will speak for himself when he closes the debate&#8212;when he suggested that the cabinet secretary had offered to restrict the role of the fiscal commission. I think that the point that he was making was that he has already done that by following the recommendations of the Finance Committee&#8217;s report. Again, I do not believe that there is a conflict of interest between membership of the two bodies.</p><p>In addition, all the nominees will serve for a single term, so they will not be beholden to the cabinet secretary to be reappointed. That further emphasises the fact that they will operate independently.</p><p>We should recognise that the cabinet secretary has taken on board some of the concerns that some members of the Finance Committee expressed about a perceived conflict of interest. He says that members of the fiscal commission will be subject to a code of conduct that will deal with the registration of interests and conflicts of interest as they arise.</p><p>For those reasons, I do not believe that there is a conflict of interests. Given the excellent nature of the nominees before us, I believe that we should back the creation of the fiscal commission and the nominees to it.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Fiscal Commission (Appointments)"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>When Iain Gray pontificates about hiding things, I cannot help but reflect on the fact that his party has established a cuts commission that will not report until after the referendum.</p><p>I turn to the matter at hand. The agreement is important because it will allow Parliament to scrutinise the Government&#8217;s budget proposals in a transparent and open manner. It is clear that we will from time to time need to update the agreement in the light of new developments. The Scotland Act 2012 and the devolution of landfill tax and stamp duty land tax, as it was, and which will be known in the future as land and buildings transaction tax, are instances of that.</p><p>We know that Parliament is putting in place measures to take forward devolution of those powers by passing the Landfill Tax (Scotland) Bill and the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Bill. We are getting on with the Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill and of course the Government is putting in place arrangements to establish an independent fiscal commission, which will further enhance and aid parliamentary budget scrutiny.</p><p>It is correct to update the written agreement to reflect the new reality. Indeed, the agreement states:</p><p>&#8220;In respect of the two devolved taxes, the Draft Budget will include a commentary on the expected income, including tax receipt forecasts and the assumptions, rates and thresholds on which they are based. The commentary will also reflect the views of the Scottish Fiscal Commission on the level of receipts.&#8221;</p><p>All the work that we are undertaking as a Parliament will be reflected in the new agreement.</p><p>I turn to another important consequence of the Scotland Act 2012&#8212;the block grant adjustment. That is also reflected in the written agreement, to which Mr Brown referred. Paragraph 23 of the agreement states:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government will provide information about the calculation of adjustments to the Scottish block grant carried out by HM Treasury.&#8221;</p><p>The UK Government command paper, which informed this Parliament&#8217;s and the Westminster Parliament&#8217;s consideration of the Scotland Act 2012, said:</p><p>&#8220;When the smaller taxes are devolved, currently planned to be April 2015, there will be a one-off reduction which will then be deducted from the block grant for all future years&#8221;.</p><p>In its most recent report on implementation of the Scotland Act 2012, the UK Government reported a change in that position; it now wants to reduce the block grant baseline and to adjust the Barnett formula. That could involve an adjustment year by year, and not just the one-off adjustment that was expected by this Parliament, and by the Westminster Parliament, when we agreed the Scotland Act 2012.</p><p>David Gauke, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, told the Finance Committee last week that it would be a one-off adjustment because it was being agreed on a one-off basis, one time, and that the Barnett formula was not being changed, merely &#8220;updated&#8221;. I posit that that is just semantics; the UK Government seems to be clearly shifting the goalposts away from what Parliament agreed when we agreed to the Scotland Act 2012.</p><p>This is an important matter for the agreement that we are debating today; the block grant adjustment will be an important part of Parliament&#8217;s budget scrutiny. I hope that the Westminster Government will play fairer than it seems to be playing at the moment in agreeing this matter with the Scottish Government. I think it is important for this Parliament to emphasise that it should be agreed soon because it will affect this coming budget process. It is important that that message comes out of this debate.</p><p>I commend the agreement and welcome the approach that has been taken by the Scottish Government in working with the Finance Committee to put the agreement in place, because it is very important for this Parliament that such an agreement be put in place to ensure that we can thoroughly scrutinise the coming budget and future budgets.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Budget Process (Written Agreement)"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>About time, too.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Budget Process (Written Agreement)"}, {"date": "2014-06-12", "body": "<p>I join Cara Hilton in thanking Elaine Smith for bringing the debate to Parliament. The issue is very worthy of our discussion, so I want to make a few comments on it.</p><p>Earlier this week, I happened to notice on Facebook a photograph that was split into two images, the first of which was of a woman breastfeeding her child in a cafe under the disapproving glare of customers. It was accompanied by a caption that said that a shawl is a handy tool for sparing embarrassment when breastfeeding. In the second image, the shawl was draped over the disapproving customers as the woman continued to feed her child. That probably works better as a visual gag than it does from my description, but I mention it because I thought that it was rather a clever and amusing way of reminding us that if someone is embarrassed by the sight of a mother feeding her child it is their problem, and not the problem of the woman who is undertaking one of the most perfectly natural activities in the world&#8212;or, at least, that is the way that it should be.</p><p>Having congratulated Elaine Smith on securing the debate, it is also appropriate that I congratulate Emily Slough, who is referred to in the motion, on organising mass breastfeeding events to highlight problems that mothers face all too regularly. We should reflect on the fact that she was thrust into the limelight rather unwittingly because of the idiocy of someone who was passing by while she breastfed her child. Someone thought it appropriate to photograph Emily Slough surreptitiously and to post the image on the internet, captioned with the word &#8220;tramp&#8221;. It is appalling that anyone would think that doing that was appropriate or amusing. Emily Slough and others who responded defiantly to such stupidity and held mass breastfeeding events should be congratulated on their efforts.</p><p>It is important to remind ourselves of the benefits of breastfeeding. Elaine Smith did that comprehensively, but we should also remember that breastfed babies have better neurological development, better cholesterol levels and better blood pressure. Women who breastfeed benefit from a lower risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hip fractures and reduced bone density. Research continues into other benefits.</p><p>Cara Hilton was right to point out the longer-term issue that relates to women breastfeeding children, but UNICEF UK has pointed out that the Health and Social Care Information Centre&#8217;s infant feeding survey indicates an improvement in the proportion of babies who are breastfed at birth, which rose by 5 percentage points between 2005 and 2010, from 76 to 81 per cent. That is positive, although the figure in Scotland was 74 per cent in 2010, which shows that we can still do better.</p><p>The challenge is that many mothers find breastfeeding in public difficult, largely because of the ignorance of others. A survey by Kamillosan camomile ointment&#8217;s manufacturers in 2011 reported that 38 per cent of breastfeeding mothers choose to breastfeed in public toilets when they are out because of unwanted attention and glares that they may receive from the public. It also reported that 12 per cent of women have been asked to stop feeding their baby in public and that 14 per cent have been reduced to having a full-scale argument with someone who objected to their feeding their baby. I say good for them for standing up for themselves, and shame on those who forced them into that.</p><p>It is important to challenge any perception that women should breastfeed in private; I hope that that will be a message from the debate. As Elaine Smith and Cara Hilton said, Parliament legislated to protect the right of mothers to feed their children. The 2005 act makes it clear that</p><p>&#8220;it is an offence deliberately to prevent or stop a person in charge of a child from feeding milk to that child in a public place or on licensed premises.&#8221;</p><p>Parliament has acted and we need to see that approach on the ground. I hope that that forms an important part of the message from the debate.

I say happy birthday and thank you to Glasgow the Caring City. I thank Neil Galbraith and his team and everyone who is involved in the charity, not least the ladies in Cathcart parish church who always make great cakes when we go along for events.</p><p>I am fascinated by the work that Glasgow the Caring City does, and I find the breadth and depth of it quite amazing. Even having listened to three contributions already, I can still think of other things that Glasgow the Caring City has been involved in, such as the wonderful link with the New York firefighters. I remember attending a very moving service at Cathcart parish church in honour of the victims of 9/11.</p><p>I was interested, too, to hear that James Dornan and Hanzala Malik have travelled to various places in the world with Glasgow the Caring City. I must be doing something wrong, because the furthest that I have ever got is East Kilbride. I mention East Kilbride mainly because it is my constituency but also to make it quite clear that Glasgow the Caring City does work at home outwith Glasgow the city itself. It is that kind of charity; wherever there is felt to be a need, we will find Glasgow the Caring City.</p><p>One thing in East Kilbride that I have been involved in is the give a kid a goal project, which I find uplifting. Hunter primary school and St Vincent&#8217;s primary school in EK have both been involved in the project, and their headteachers are to be commended for having realised the value of it. It makes it quite normal and natural for children to work towards goals themselves while recognising that they should work towards those goals for children in other parts of the world, too. Too often we hear phrases such as &#8220;charity begins at home.&#8221; Glasgow the Caring City makes it quite plain that charity may well begin at home, but it certainly should not end there, because we are all one big global family.</p><p>The fact that it imparts that message to young people and makes it fun is what makes the charity so precious. It is a long time since I was at primary school and I will except the minister from this, but I think that just about everyone else in the chamber would agree that if their teacher ever said that the reverend from the local church or the priest from the local Roman Catholic church was coming along, the children thought, &#8220;Oh no.&#8221; In the schools in East Kilbride, if the teacher says that the Rev Neil Galbraith is coming along, the children think, &#8220;Yahoo! This is wonderful. We&#8217;re going to have a great time&#8221;. That raises their self-esteem, too.</p><p>Another thing that has not been mentioned today is the cross out child poverty initiative started and carried through by Glasgow the Caring City. I want to extend that initiative to East Kilbride; I hold my hands up and admit that I have been quite lax in so doing, but that is on-going.</p><p>That initiative is a recognition that we have to work across borders and boundaries. There is absolute poverty in other parts of the world, which we should address and raise awareness of, but we should also recognise that there is relative poverty in our country&#8212;in our cities, satellite towns and rural areas. If we are truly talking about having successful cities and towns and a successful nation, and extending that across the world, we have to recognise that we are all in it together. That is what Glasgow the Caring City does in a wonderfully non-judgmental way, from which we can all learn lessons.</p><p>I am delighted to recognise the 15th anniversary of Glasgow the Caring City. I do not just wish it another 15 years; I hope that it continues way beyond that.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow the Caring City"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>Normally in a members&#8217; business debate, I would thank the member for lodging the motion and support it. I could not do that today because there are things that are very wrong with the motion. Two statements in the motion, in particular, are completely erroneous; one is about the job losses in East Kilbride and the other is about the fragmentation of aid spending. I will go on to say more about those.</p><p>For a couple of years, there has been an on-going campaign by better together in East Kilbride, telling civil servants both in Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, which is also based there, and in DFID that their jobs will go if they vote yes. That is shameful scaremongering, and it has been going on for a long time. It is abhorrent to scare people like that&#8212;it is on a par with the advice that was given to civil servants at the Department for Work and Pensions by the permanent secretary, which emerged yesterday.</p><p>When the Scottish Government makes things clear, it tends to carry them through&#8212;I think that our record stands on that&#8212;and the Scottish Government has made it clear that it will offer continuity of employment and that it has a no compulsory redundancies policy in place. That is more than the UK Government has. Let us face it: Labour and Tory UK Governments have cut civil service jobs right across Scotland, so the real threat to DFID jobs in East Kilbride is a no vote.</p><p>The UK Government has been committed to cutting jobs in DFID from 2014. Westminster&#8217;s International Development Committee&#8212;which includes Margaret McCulloch&#8217;s friend in the no campaign Michael McCann&#8212;concluded in one of its inquiries that the number of DFID staff in East Kilbride will decline from 2014. Mr McCann himself has been asking parliamentary questions about DFID for quite a while. Speaking of a recent one, he said:</p><p>&#8220;I warned that ... the UK Government had drawn up secret plans to axe a third of the workforce at the Department for International Development in East Kilbride.&#8221;</p><p>He said that he had heard that the UK Government</p><p>&#8220;was preparing to sacrifice staff in East Kilbride in order to protect the department&#8217;s London HQ.&#8221;</p><p>The threat to jobs at DFID in East Kilbride is coming from the UK Government. Yet again, the Labour Party is more than happy to tell one story down the road and another up here because it considers it more important to do down the SNP and the yes campaign. To do that, Labour will even cover up what the Tories and Lib Dems are doing. I find that absolutely appalling.</p><p>The motion quotes Mr Dave Fish, whom I met some years ago and had a lot of respect for. He has been writing for the better together campaign, on its website. He is entitled to do that, but a lot of holes can be picked in what he is saying, particularly about the fragmentation of aid. The evidence that is given by the non-governmental organisations in Scotland and by many respected people who have worked in international development for years is that it does not matter what size an aid programme is; the important thing is how effective it is.</p><p>Let us face it, the commitment to development index, which ranks overall contributions to development and their effectiveness, has the UK in eighth place. The top three ranked countries are Denmark, Sweden and Norway&#8212;small independent countries that work together to deliver good international aid. Are we hearing from Margaret McCulloch that the UK cares so much about international aid and poverty world wide, but that it would refuse to work with its neighbour Scotland to make sure that countries in poverty were getting the best deal?</p><p>I want Scotland to be independent. I want our international development budget to be part of a wider international strategy. That means none of the illegal wars, such as the ones that the Labour Party took us into; that means no locking up asylum-seeking families, an approach that the Labour Party took us into and that the Lib Dems and the Tories have carried on.

We are having the debate because of STV&#8217;s Scotland&#8217;s real heroes awards, which are sponsored by the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p><p>I would like to say a few words about STV. It should be noted that STV, in my part of the country certainly&#8212;I say &#8220;in my part of the country&#8221; because somebody who represents the Borders would be able to say that there are issues there, although I know that they are being addressed as far as possible&#8212;as well as in Glasgow and all the cities, and generally across the country, has become like community television for us. It cares about communities and does a lot of work in them to recognise those who make them so strong.</p><p>I found that that was particularly the case in East Kilbride when a wonderful lass called Kayleigh Mcleod from STV worked there. She is still very much missed by the community groups and charities with which she worked and for which she raised awareness of their work.</p><p>That is what &#8220;Finding Scotland&#8217;s Real Heroes&#8221; is about. The series celebrates people&#8217;s efforts and dedication, with the Scottish public voting for the winners. For reference, it will be on from 15 August, with an episode every Friday thereafter. The series pays tribute to people who work hard in their communities and have ambition and generosity&#8212;it is about improving things for other people.</p><p>East Kilbride has loads of that&#8212;in the 20 years or so in which I have worked there, I have found a very strong sense of that. People from all walks of life and all age groups work very hard to give others a helping hand and improve things in their area.</p><p>The series recognises all those things. The awards shortlist includes nominees for entrepreneur of the year, sporting volunteer of the year, hero neighbour of the year, community champion of the year, community project of the year and environmental project of the year. There is the courage award, which I want to talk about in particular, the carer of the year award, the young real hero of the year award and the hero animal of the year award&#8212;our own Mr Q should perhaps have been put in for that for putting up with us all and with all the noise in the chamber. As I said, viewers vote for the nominees who they think most deserve to win the real heroes awards.</p><p>I congratulate the past winners. There have been some fantastic winners.</p><p>Before I get on to East Kilbride, I will speak about the current nominees, who come from all walks of life. They should all be celebrated, and I hope that members will mention them. There are nominees from Glasgow, Inverclyde, Skye, West Lothian, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Caithness, the Highlands&#8212;I hope that I am not missing anybody&#8212;and East Ayrshire. There are people on the shortlist from Edinburgh, too, and from Clydebank, Portobello, Argyll and Bute, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. However, as far as I am concerned, the ones who should win live in East Kilbride, because East Kilbride has real heroes. I will say a few words about the nominees from East Kilbride.</p><p>The first has a fantastic name: maw&#8217;s mafia&#8212;that is a fabulous name. Four ladies&#8212;Elma Ross, Lynn Morrison, Lesley McGinlay and Connie Smillie&#8212;have been nominated for the carer award. They are certainly known locally as maw&#8217;s mafia, and we are aw quite scared of them. Those ladies do various kinds of voluntary work, but they have fought very hard for their children&#8217;s rights.</p><p>There is a big issue here. Young people with special needs go to school together, form friendships and social relationships, and perhaps go to the youth club together. When they leave school, they carry on going to the youth club, but when they hit 21 and are too old to go to it&#8212;they are not allowed to go to it any more&#8212;their social network falls apart. All of a sudden, they are isolated. Maw&#8217;s mafia got together with others and started up a weekly club. It started off in Claremont parish church and now meets in Calderglen high school every Monday night. It offers social services, trips and activities for 18 to 25-year-olds. Alison Gilmour, whose niece, Stephanie Kelly, was left wheelchair-bound after an accident, nominated East Kilbride hangout for the award. That is a fantastic service that is growing all the time. I pay tribute to the Bruce hotel in East Kilbride, which has just offered regular discos free of charge in the Skye lounge.</p><p>The other person in East Kilbride who has been nominated&#8212;for the courage award&#8212;is Miss Jenny Cook, whom I am sure many members will have heard of. Aged 11, she is a fantastic young lady. Jenny has ulcerative colitis and, aged just six, she had her diseased large bowel removed, because medication was no longer working. However, even with that, Jenny started fundraising and persuaded her family, teachers and school friends to help out. She was only five when she organised her first fundraiser, which raised &#163;5,000&#8212;she is quite a gal. A couple of years later, she met Derek McEwan, who set up the Catherine McEwan foundation in memory of his mum, who died of Crohn&#8217;s disease. They have been fundraising ever since. Jenny is absolutely astounding. At age 11, she has raised more than &#163;30,000 for the Yorkhill Children&#8217;s Charity and she has not stopped yet, because her next target is &#163;50,000 by 2016.</p><p>Jenny is becoming very well known, because she is a special young girl. She is regularly on Radio Clyde with Robin Galloway, doing the Jenny Cook report, which is on how her charity work is going, and she has become terribly good friends with our First Minister. In fact, she was one of his guests at the recent Commonwealth games opening ceremony. However, I think that the First Minister&#8217;s nose will be a bit out of joint because, since Jenny was interviewed by Nicholas McDonald for the STV programme, I am afraid that he is uppermost in Jenny&#8217;s mind. Jenny also does great buddying work with other young people at Yorkhill, which is important, and she runs a huge fundraiser every year called &#8220;Tea Jenny&#8221;, which takes place in September.</p><p>I could talk about the nominees for ever, but I am running out of time. It is particularly great that maw&#8217;s mafia from the hangout and Jenny Cook will meet up soon to give each other support going into the competition, because that is what the community of East Kilbride does and that is what it is like. I close by saying that, yes, East Kilbride has real heroes.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Real Heroes (East Kilbride)"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>I am particularly pleased to see the report&#8217;s plans for schools and colleges to join employers in sustained, fruitful partnerships, which will be to their mutual benefit.</p><p>There are already employers in East Kilbride that are interested in those ideas.

Commemorations will take place in communities throughout the country to mark anniversaries that are specific to our Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force and the exceptional sacrifices that were made in the first and second world wars. We should support our servicemen and servicewomen, past and present, full-time and reservists, which is why I am pleased to support the minister&#8217;s motion.</p><p>I particularly note progress with the appointment of a new Scottish veterans commissioner to ensure</p><p>&#8220;the highest level of services and support available&#8221;</p><p>for our armed forces community. I understand that that ambassador will work with services charities, local authorities and health boards to identify any areas and public services that could provide greater support to veterans, and help to shape future policy developments and opportunities.</p><p>Progress in that regard has been made across our public services. On health, the Scottish Government has put in place a raft of measures to remove disadvantages that members of the armed forces community face in accessing the national health service. There is priority NHS treatment for veterans and serving and retired reservists who have service-related conditions and&#8212;this is important&#8212;the Government has ensured that veterans can receive state-of-the-art prosthetic limbs, which are equivalent in standard to those that the defence medical services provide.</p><p>The minister mentioned specialist mental health services. Services have been enhanced by the introduction of a six-week intensive post-traumatic stress disorder treatment programme, through a partnership between NHS Scotland and Combat Stress. That is important, because although the effects of PTSD can be felt immediately after the trauma, the condition can manifest itself a long way down the line, so it is important that it is being recognised.</p><p>It is also important to have an armed forces champion in every NHS board in Scotland. We have such champions in local authorities, but I recognise what Alex Fergusson said about it not always being apparent that specialists are there to help to co-ordinate services. I hope that when the veterans champion or commissioner is appointed, the issue will be given much greater recognition.</p><p>On housing, guidance for landlords has been revised to highlight issues that former services personnel face, and to give landlords flexibility.

The presence of a veterans in custody support officer in each prison in Scotland is an excellent initiative, which will be supplemented by the work of the Scottish veterans prison in-reach group.</p><p>The support does not all go in one direction. The motion refers to the</p><p>&#8220;valuable skills, experience and sense of civic responsibility that ex-service personnel bring to society on returning to civilian life&#8221;.</p><p>That is true. The organisations that do excellent work to support our armed forces personnel are generally headed by ex-service people, as are the Army, RAF and sea cadets organisations in many of our constituencies&#8212;we have strong cadets organisations in East Kilbride&#8212;which offer excellent opportunities for young people.</p><p>Many other voluntary organisations are headed by people who have military connections. Global charities are often manned by people who use the skills and international experience that they gained in the services to help other people all round the world. I have unlimited respect for Mission Aviation Fellowship, which was founded by a former military pilot and involves many ex-service personnel, who work on the ground and fly to difficult parts of the world to help other organisations to take support and succour to people in need.</p><p>I recognise that our services personnel have valuable skills, and I acknowledge the debt of gratitude that we owe them.

At the previous election, a Sikh chap in East Kilbride got in touch with me to say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t know enough about our religion, our culture, our heritage and our history and it&#8217;s about time you did.&#8221; He was quite right. It is terrible thing to generalise about people, but it seems to me that the Sikhs are a pretty straightforward kind of folk, who tell things like they are. I started to learn about Sikhism and visited the gurdwara in Glasgow, where I was fascinated to learn about the history of Sikhism in the Indian subcontinent, and about the related history of Sikhs in the UK, which goes back a couple of centuries; I read in the briefing from the gurdwara that the first Sikh who came to Scotland did so in 1849.</p><p>We are talking about British citizens. We are talking about English Sikhs, Welsh Sikhs, Irish Sikhs and Scottish Sikhs who deserve justice. As Sandra White&#8217;s motion points out, it does not look as though they are getting much justice at the moment from the Government of the country in which they live.</p><p>From what we have heard, I can understand why members of the Sikh community were absolutely reeling when they learned that the UK Government had been involved in planning the 1984 Indian army attack on the Golden temple in Amritsar, and had advised the army on the plan to remove Sikh extremists from the temple. I can understand why people feel that it is time that the truth was uncovered, and why they feel strongly that a public inquiry should be held to bring everything out into the open.</p><p>I was aware that when the Prime Minister, David Cameron, visited the Golden temple just over a year ago, he declined to apologise for the 1919 massacre there, but said that we must &#8220;learn lessons&#8221;. That is fair enough. Let us learn lessons. Surely, one of the lessons that must be learned is that we have to be open and transparent about the truth when people in our own country&#8212;our own citizens&#8212;call for that and feel that they are being extremely unfairly treated.</p><p>There are issues with the report; there are events and documents relating to the events that were pivotal to the inquiry but which were not specified. There is a view that they have to be specified so that we can get full transparency. The report said that the reason why such documentation was not permitted is the practices of the Indian Government. That is a bit of a woolly statement. Practices are not law. If those are the practices of the Indian Government, the British Government does not have to agree with them. There is surely room for much discussion on that.</p><p>What really got to me was that no question was raised about the practical UK support for military operations. It was described as &#8220;an internal matter&#8221;. We have heard that over and over again, but it is a bit of a cop-out. Some time ago, the UK Government was sending arms to Indonesia under a so-called ethical foreign policy that said that those weapons should never be used for external aggression or internal oppression. However, the Government was still selling arms, even though people were being slaughtered in East Timor and West Papua. That lesson does not seem to have been learned.</p><p>I agree with everything in Sandra White&#8217;s motion and with the call from the Sikh community in Scotland&#8212;the Scots Sikhs&#8212;for an inquiry, because it deserves the truth. I would like the UK Government to agree that it will look for the truth and declare that lessons have been learned.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Operation Blue Star"}, {"date": "2014-05-21", "body": "<p></p><p>2.

Having looked at all the work that has been done during the bill process, I am not convinced that we could have put the requirement on the living wage in the bill.</p><p>I am really pleased with what the cabinet secretary has proposed; she is absolutely right that public procurement already has a complex and demanding set of rules, but the bill has achieved a balance. It has been a long time coming, since the cabinet secretary&#8217;s Government came in in 2007 and started to revise procurement&#8212;to make it better and to streamline it by cutting down on bureaucracy. It is wonderful to have that two-pronged approach: it is business-friendly as well as socially responsible, which is extremely important. Legislation is only one part of the reform agenda. I am glad to hear that we can look forward to more proposals, so that we can achieve our aims.</p><p>One of the things that I believe is business-friendly and socially responsible is the emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises in relation to public procurement in Scotland, which has defined localities and parts of local authorities doing a lot of public procurement. It means that the wellbeing of communities and the support for SMEs can be combined.</p><p>It is difficult in that we operate under European procurement rules, which can make it hard, but there are innovative ways of managing that. After all, small and medium-sized enterprises account for more than 99 per cent of enterprises in Scotland, more than 53 per cent of employment and 36.5 per cent of turnover. They are very important. There has been a lot of discussion about the possibility of breaking contracts into smaller lots in order that we can take best advantage of small and medium-sized enterprises, but European directives will have to be looked at carefully if we are to allow that to happen. We are, therefore, right to have fairly straightforward procurement legislation that allows us to look carefully at future directives in order that we can transpose them to the best possible advantage.</p><p>In East Kilbride, a task force has been set up by South Lanarkshire Council. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to go along to its meetings, because it seems to have a problem in respect of whether I can keep things commercially confidential&#8212;that is an argument that I will have with the council. I hope that the task force takes the issue on board and that South Lanarkshire, in looking at East Kilbride, considers the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises.

I thank all the members who signed my motion and who support the cause, and those who have stayed to contribute to the debate. I realise that it is all very hectic at the moment, so their time is appreciated.</p><p>I note that, sadly, the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment and the Minister for Environment and Climate Change have been called away on other business, but I am pleased to see the Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs, Roseanna Cunningham, standing in, as I know that she has taken a keen interest in the issue in the past in her previous life as an environment minister.</p><p>As a member of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, I have become increasingly aware of the challenges that Scotland&#8217;s pollinators face. I thank Craig Macadam of Buglife&#8212;the Invertebrate Conservation Trust and Dr Maggie Keegan of the Scottish Wildlife Trust for their help and advice on the subject, which is more complex the more we investigate it.</p><p>Buglife actively works to conserve the 40,000 invertebrate species in the United Kingdom, many of which are under threat as never before. Invertebrates from bees to beetles are vital to our planet and precious ecosystem. They underpin life on earth and are therefore pivotal for our own survival.</p><p>Insect-pollinated crops rely on invertebrates to carry pollen from one flower to the other, producing crops for many fruits, nuts and seeds. Buglife estimates that 84 per cent of European Union crops rely on insect pollination. To put that into perspective, it is estimated that every third mouthful of food that is consumed could be linked to pollination by bees.</p><p>Insect-pollinated fruits and vegetables that are grown in Scotland contribute significantly to our economy as well as to our ecosystem. For example, the output value of vegetables in 2012 was &#163;102 million, and the figure for fruits was &#163;62 million. In addition, the pollination that is provided by insect pollinators to wildflowers and garden ornamentals makes insect pollinators a vital component of our great biodiversity in Scotland.</p><p>Without pollinators, we could see a depletion of the foods that we grow and the beauty that we see in our wider countryside. Pollinator insects ensure food security and the continuation of biodiversity across Scotland. However, the fragility of pollinator populations means that, if they are not cared for, they will be easily damaged or diminished, or can become dysfunctional. The decline of pollinator insects in recent years is not easily determined by a single driving force, but has been caused by a multiplicity of factors, including environmental pressures, pests and diseases&#8212;for example, reductions in wildflowers, the intensification of land use, fertilisation, and harmful pesticides.</p><p>Unfortunately, I know a bit about harmful pesticides, having used without proper protection the organophosphate pesticide carbofuran on my father&#8217;s farm in the Western Isles when I was younger. I have paid the price health-wise. Carbofuran has long since been banned, but it is still used illegally to kill birds of prey.</p><p>That said, it is neonicotinoids that seem to have had a major impact on bees, so it is encouraging that the EU has imposed a two-year ban on them. Ideally, a permanent ban in Scotland would help pollinators such as bees to recover, it is argued, although, as the NFU Scotland highlighted in its briefing, any ban should be based on realistic field-based research.</p><p>Over the past 50 years, declines have been noted in the number of not only many pollinator insects but wildflowers across our countryside. The sustainability of the ecosystem depends on maintaining pollinator populations and their habitats. That is why the EU&#8217;s integrated pest management directive is so important. If we want our future generations to live in a Scotland that is buzzing&#8212;excuse the pun&#8212;with vitality and rich in foods and flowers, we must act now to preserve our landscapes and save our precious pollinators from extinction.</p><p>In &#8220;Get Britain Buzzing: A Manifesto for Pollinators&#8221;, Buglife outlined seven key principles that can guide our battle in rescuing our valued ecosystem, and 27 actions that can arrest the alarming decline of the pollinator population. Principally, all pollinators should be valued for the service that they provide to Scotland. They should also be properly monitored and understood, and there should be a commitment to conserve and incorporate them in our green infrastructure.</p><p>Unfortunately, I do not have time to list all the principles and actions that Buglife is calling for, but I commend &#8220;Get Britain Buzzing: A Manifesto for Pollinators&#8221; to members. If members would like to contact me, I can provide them with a copy of it.</p><p>Good work has already been done. I congratulate the Government on the excellent work that it has done so far in undertaking initiatives to halt bee decline over the past few years. For example, there was the Scottish Government project in 2009 that invested up to &#163;10 million in research to help to identify the main threats to bees and other insect pollinators. Government-backed agri-environment schemes that have offered payments to farmers to help them to maintain flower-rich areas for bees and other wildlife have also been an encouraging step forward in sustaining our pollinator habitat.</p><p>Recently&#8212;in June this year&#8212;the Scottish Parliament welcomed a new buzz to this busy and hectic environment by installing two beehives on site, demonstrating the real and practical way in which the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament have been committed to the nation&#8217;s environment. I am sure that other speakers will touch on our Parliament bees during the debate.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Pollinator Population"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>Yes. I am not asking members to do that personally.</p><p>Although previous actions that have been taken are commendable, we must do more to address this serious issue. The Government actions that have been prescribed must be taken in conjunction with a responsibility for local government, for example, to facilitate initiatives in their areas that preserve Scottish wildlife and conserve our pollinator population.</p><p>As MSP for Falkirk East, I have seen at first hand in my constituency the great work that communities can undertake. The Jupiter urban wildlife centre is a fantastic example of how wildlife can be preserved. What is unique about the centre is that it is an urban green space that has been created from wasteland in the middle of industrial Grangemouth. My constituents, together with non-governmental organisations, have done an excellent job in constructing a reserve that both facilitates pollinator populations and encourages the community to invest in sustaining the pollinator habitat. Providing both educational and community resources, the Jupiter urban wildlife centre is an invaluable hub that we hope to see replicated in many other parts of Scotland. I very much look forward to visiting the centre tomorrow morning to officially open, along with local schoolchildren, the upgraded wildlife gardens there.</p><p>In closing, I encourage all my fellow MSPs to add their support to the Buglife cause. Collapses in pollinator populations in China and parts of the United States have had big and visible impacts on their ecosystems and economies, but Scotland could lead the way in conservation and the sustenance of pollinators if we choose to act now and refuse to let species struggle to survive. Our rich, beautiful and vast countryside and vegetation depend on us to actively work to protect them. I therefore hope that stakeholders, including scientists, farmers, regulators, beekeepers and environmental NGOs will all work together to ensure that Scottish farming and bees can co-exist and have a sustainable future.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Pollinator Population"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p></p><p>3.

I grew Kerr&#8217;s Pinks on the family farms up in Stornoway for the Outer Hebridean market, where their floury dry texture goes so well with local delicacies such as salt herring and guga. Guga, of course, is salt baby gannet, and it is something for which, half a century on from being born on the Isle of Lewis, l have still not managed to acquire a taste. I can say that without worrying about damaging the guga industry, as demand greatly exceeds supply.</p><p>My association with the humble spud continued when I trained as a livestock auctioneer with United Auctions in Stirling, where we would regularly hold seed potato sales and where I learned about hundreds of varieties that I had never heard of before. As a trainee auctioneer, I would, after the sale, have to phone in the sale report to The Herald, The Scotsman, The Press and Journal and The Courier. As that was in the days before e-mail and fax, I had to spell out each of the varieties to the copy girls, and I now have varieties such as Desiree, Pentland Javelin, Osprey and Russet Burbank etched on my mind. I am also sure that there are many retired copy girls out there who are extremely relieved at no longer having to type endless lists of potato varieties for hours on end.</p><p>Potatoes with colourful names such as Pimpernel, Galactica, Fontane, Asterix and Sylvana are just a few of the 700 varieties held by the Scottish Government in its national potato collection.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Potatoes"}, {"date": "2014-06-04", "body": "<p>Absolutely. The Scottish Government&#8217;s tonnage figures show that only a handful of varieties are used, and there are many other brilliant varieties out there that people are not but should be made aware of.</p><p>Scotland produces 600,000 tonnes of potatoes each year. That tonnage is valued at around &#163;180 million, and around half of it is made up of our world-class seed potatoes, which are clearly the foundation of our potato industry. Scottish seed potatoes are exported to more than 50 countries outside the EU and generate &#163;35 million for the economy; Egypt is the largest seed export destination, with demand up 20 per cent on previous years, and Scotland has now overtaken the Netherlands as the largest seed supplier to that country.</p><p>There is lots of good news out there about Scottish potatoes&#8212;and, indeed, there is even more. A recent study published in the British Nutrition Foundation&#8217;s Nutrition Bulletin on the nutritional values of potatoes and potato products in the UK diet revealed that choosing to consume potatoes in place of more energy-dense foods could have a significant impact on reducing calorie consumption and improve nutrient density, potentially contributing to the avoidance of obesity. I am certainly taking note of that. In addition, potatoes as a white vegetable play an important role in enriching the diet by providing important micronutrients as well as dietary fibre and unsaturated fatty acids. Potato consumption is declining slightly, but it would seem that it should be encouraged, particularly given that, according to the study, potatoes provide on average more fibre, more potassium, more vitamin C, more folate and more magnesium compared with their energy contribution. In other words, potatoes increase the diet&#8217;s nutrient density and play an important role in improving our diet. They are not only a source of dietary fibre; they provide the micronutrients that I mentioned earlier. In short, provided that care is taken over the amount of added fat and salt, the consumption of potatoes, as white vegetables, should be encouraged alongside the consumption of coloured vegetables as part of a healthy, balanced diet.</p><p>My time is limited, but I will squeeze in a bit of praise for the Scottish Rural University College and the work that it continues to do on blight-resistant varieties. Late blight costs Scottish farmers around &#163;500 per hectare, or up to half of all production costs. The SRUC believes that using newer blight-resistant varieties could help to control blight in a more cost-effective way.</p><p>It is clear that a lot of work is going on at all stages in the potato industry, from research to growing to marketing.

In addition, primary and secondary schools from all across the Falkirk Council area come for formal education sessions, with an estimated 18,000 local schoolchildren having visited the centre over the past 22 years. In addition, students from the Falkirk and the Alloa campuses of the local Forth Valley College spend a lot of time there over the winter.

I recognise that the minister cannot comment on live applications, but it is clear that the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment in the new Scottish planning policy to introducing buffer zones between unconventional gas developments and communities is very welcome for communities that would be affected. However, can the minister confirm that local authorities will be able to take action retrospectively in respect of buffer zones for applications that have been received during the existing SPP?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Planning (Falkirk Council)"}, {"date": "2014-05-01", "body": "<p>I extend my thanks to Caroline Wilson, who brought the petition to the Public Petitions Committee on behalf of the Evening Times and Kidney Research UK (Scotland). As we heard from the convener, the petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to introduce an opt-out system of organ donation to help to save more lives. Saving lives is the crux of the matter. Organ donation saves lives, so increasing the rate of donation will allow us to save more lives.</p><p>NHS Blood and Transplant reports that, as of 8 April, 595 patients in Scotland were waiting for a transplant. Last year, unfortunately, 34 people died in Scotland while waiting for a transplant. More are taken off the waiting list as they become too ill to receive an organ.</p><p>A conservative estimate from the British Medical Association is that around 70 per cent of people are willing to donate their organs after death, but only 40 per cent of the population in Scotland are registered as organ donors. I am both proud and ashamed of that figure. I am proud because, for the past five years, as the minister said, the number of transplants has gone up and the waiting list has got smaller. The proportion of registered donors in Scotland is now about 8 percentage points higher than in the UK as a whole.</p><p>Those improvements are a result of the efforts of the Scottish Government and the regional health boards in implementing the recommendations in the organ donation task force&#8217;s 2008 report. However, I am concerned that lives are still being lost unnecessarily because people who are willing to donate organs after their death simply never get round to making their views known. That results in relatives making a decision without knowing that the deceased was willing to donate. For that reason, I believe that it is essential that we consider ways in which the organ donation system can be improved further to reduce the number of avoidable deaths.</p><p>Since 2008 and the implementation of the organ donation task force&#8217;s recommendations, significant improvements in the infrastructure have been made and donor rates have increased. Now that that has reached fruition and the new systems and arrangements have become settled, we need to decide as a society and as a Parliament what the next steps should be. We have a well-organised, well-funded and comprehensive infrastructure in place to facilitate organ donation, but there is clearly still a great deal of scope for improvement.</p><p>The organ donation task force commissioned the University of York to undertake a systematic review of all relevant published data on an opt-out system of organ donation. In the countries that were looked at, the review found that opt-out law or practice was associated with an increase of 21 to 30 per cent in the rate of donation following the introduction of an opt-out system. However, it would be misleading of me not to inform Parliament that the study found that a number of other factors appear to be associated with improved organ donation rates, such as transplant capacity, health expenditure per capita and public awareness. I believe, though, that those areas have already been improved on. Indeed, the 2013 publication &#8220;Taking Organ Transplantation to 2020&#8221; follows up on the previous organ donation task force 2008 report and shifts focus to donor apathy. The new strategy builds on the achievement of an increase in donor registration and focuses on reducing the high family refusal rate, which at 43 per cent is one of the highest in the western world.</p><p>If Scotland was to move to an opt-out system of organ donation, we would not be starting from scratch. As well as having examples to draw on from the well-established opt-out systems in Spain, Austria, Portugal and Belgium, some of which have been referred to, the Scottish Government can follow the precedent that has been set by the National Assembly for Wales. The Welsh legislation, which received royal assent on 10 September last year, introduces a soft opt-out system. The Public Petitions Committee was pleased to take evidence from Mark Drakeford AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services, during a useful videolink session. I had hoped to cover the points that were raised during that session, but my time is limited.</p><p>I welcome Michael Matheson&#8217;s assurance that he will follow progress in Wales with interest, although I believe that it will be at least two years before we can judge whether it has been successful. I take on board the minister&#8217;s view that the Scottish Government is not yet convinced of the benefits, but I believe that it is clear that an opt-out system is an effective mechanism to increase availability of organs for transplant and ultimately save the lives of people with end-stage organ failure who have no other treatment options available to them.</p><p>An opt-out system of organ donation should be considered as part of the Scottish Government&#8217;s broader strategy to improve donation rates. Under the system, individuals would have exactly the same choice as in an opt-in system&#8212;to donate or not to donate. I therefore look forward to the issue being debated further in Parliament, with a view to progress being made on the issue, which I hope will be at some time in the not-too-distant future.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Organ Donation"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/25094.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "image_width": 78, "person_id": "25094", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Angus MacDonald", "member_id": "80414", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Falkirk East"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Matheson", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>The total annual service charge payable to Consort Healthcare in respect of the Edinburgh royal infirmary for 2013-14 was &#163;47 million.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (Annual Service Charge)"}, {"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>NHS Lothian is in the process of establishing an expert review group that will look at the contract in great detail.

As every member who has spoken has also done, I recognise the fantastic job that our general practitioners do. They provide a vital service that lies at the heart of our vision of delivering an integrated health and social care system. In recognising the key role that GPs play in our system, it is important that we ensure that we have in place processes that allow them to maximise their potential in helping to shape health and social care in a community setting.</p><p>Alison McInnes and Malcolm Chisholm recognised the stark challenges that the demographic shift we face presents us with. By 2033, the number of people who are over the age of 75 is likely to have increased by almost 60 per cent, and with age, as with poverty, comes a higher chance of having a long-term illness. Many individuals will have such a condition at that point in their lives. Those are real challenges, and we need to ensure that we do the right work to support the general practice profession and the NHS so that they can meet them.</p><p>I want to outline some of the actions that we are taking to support our GPs in meeting those challenges. We have been working closely with the profession to modernise the GP contract and to transform our approach to the delivery of primary care. The 2014-15 general medical services contract in Scotland has been negotiated and agreed with the Scottish general practitioners committee. As well as bringing direct benefits for patients, it will reduce bureaucracy for GPs through a 30 per cent reduction in the QOF, which Malcolm Chisholm referred to. The transfer of around &#163;36 million from the QOF into the core contract will help to provide greater financial stability for practices and will give GPs a greater opportunity to make judgments about how that resource should be used. It will also give them greater flexibility to make clinical judgments on how they can best meet the needs of their patients.</p><p>The contract enables each GP practice to become involved in integration planning and decision making through a lead GP who will link with the local partnership organisation. That is a key element of the role that general practice needs to perform in the future. As part of the contract, each practice will undertake a review of access and will participate in a programme of quality improvement.</p><p>The 2014-15 contract also places greater trust in the professionalism of GPs. I believe that it gives us a good platform for some of the further development work that needs to take place if we are to create sustainable general practice provision in Scotland. Overall, the Government&#8217;s ambition is for a GP contract that gives GPs the time to do what they really want to do&#8212;to work with individuals to ensure that their medical care is right for them, their families, their carers and the local environment.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Your GP Cares Campaign"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>We have agreed how we can build on the 2014-15 contract and how, moving forward, we can ensure that we shape the contract so that it reflects the needs of general practice in Scotland. We will do that with the Scottish general practitioners committee, so that we can develop the contract to ensure not only that it reflects our values and needs but that it tackles issues such as recruitment and retention, which Alison McInnes and Nanette Milne highlighted.</p><p>In addition, a range of work can be done outwith the contract to modernise general practice. It should be recognised that a tremendous amount of innovative improvement exercises are already being undertaken at local level. We are working with a number of practices to understand what works and how it works.</p><p>We have also provided &#163;1 million this year to the primary care modernisation programme to look at how we can build on areas where good practice has been identified. The first stage of that programme is the strategic assessments of primary care that boards will conduct at a local level and which should form part of their local planning process for 2014-15. We are also co-funding a programme of work that is being led by NHS Highland to develop and test models of healthcare delivery that are sustainable in remote and rural areas. We have provided &#163;1.5 million to allow the programme to test different models of how we can meet the challenge of recruitment and retention, particularly in rural areas, and assess what model of care can best meet the needs of those local communities.</p><p>Nanette Milne referred to a point that Alison McInnes made about the planning of housing developments and the pressure that they can place on local service delivery. Health boards are key participants in developing local development plans. That is to allow the planning of sufficient healthcare provision in relation to any local development plan that is being taken forward by a local authority. Scottish planning policy makes it clear that local authorities must take account of the availability of public services and infrastructure, including primary healthcare provision, when assessing sites for new housing developments. That must be seen as being part of the core purpose of carrying out the local assessment process.</p><p>Nanette Milne rose&#8212;</p><p>I will give way to Nanette Milne.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Your GP Cares Campaign"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>That is why the planning of primary healthcare provision is a key part of local authorities&#8217; local planning processes, which look years ahead.

I have listened with real interest to members&#8217; contributions this evening. Perth royal infirmary is a key member of the NHS Tayside family, and the Government&#8217;s ambition is that it should continue to go from strength to strength, to ensure that high-quality services and care are delivered for the people of Perth and the surrounding area.</p><p>In the course of tonight&#8217;s debate, I would like to pay tribute to the dedication and professionalism of the staff, both past and present, who work day in, day out to deliver those vital healthcare services and to make the experience of their patients as good as it can be. It is quite right that we should mark the 100-year anniversary of healthcare provision on the site and we should celebrate that. As Liz Smith said, there will be a range of planned activities including a local health fair with a special birthday cake, an exhibition of photographs and historical artefacts, a day of historical programming on Perth hospital radio, and a ceremonial re-laying of the original royal plaque by the NHS Tayside chair, Sandy Watson, which will take place on 10 July.</p><p>Members may be interested to know that the hospital is getting its very own biography. Bruce Leckie, a member of staff at NHS Tayside who previously worked at PRI, has produced a book documenting the building and the royal opening. Mr Leckie, who has kindly joined us tonight, has indicated that any profits from the sale of the book will be donated to the PRI endowment fund. On behalf of the Scottish Government, I offer my thanks to him for undertaking that piece of work and for his generous donation to the endowment fund.</p><p>In celebrating the proud history of PRI and the contribution of its current and former staff, it is important that we look ahead to the use of PRI and the provision of NHS services in NHS Tayside overall in providing 21st century healthcare to the local people. I am sure that all members recognise the challenge that is presented by an increasing and increasingly elderly population, and we are aware that that is particularly relevant in Perthshire. Members may be aware that the total population of Perth and Kinross is projected to increase by 20 per cent between 2012 and 2033, which is more than twice the national average of 8 per cent. However, the population of those aged 65 and above is projected to increase by 52 per cent in the same period, and of those aged 75 and above by 75 per cent. That is precisely why we published our equality strategy and the 2020 vision with its accompanying route map to ensure that the 2020 vision is taken forward at local level, allowing individuals to live healthier lives in their own homes or in a homely setting.</p><p>Part of the work to deliver the 2020 vision is the exciting work that is being done in the NHS Tayside area, including at PRI, with the creation of the rapid assessment model of care for unscheduled medical patient admissions, which will enable a new model of care to meet the needs of the local population. The early work on that project has been developed by listening to the views of staff and patients on what they felt would make a difference to the care environment in the hospital, including seven-day multiprofessional team working, timely patient discharge and an expansion of the role of volunteers.</p><p>However, we all know that good-quality healthcare is not just about new initiatives in themselves; at times, it is about just doing the day job really well. In emergency care, Perth royal infirmary is part of a single system of emergency care that operates across the Tayside region to ensure that patients who require urgent care are seen at the right place, at the right time, by the right person. NHS Tayside&#8217;s performance in that area is among the best in Scotland, with more than 98 per cent of patients meeting the four-hour accident and emergency standard every year since 2008-09. It is the only mainland board with such a consistent record in that area.</p><p>NHS Tayside has more than halved the size of its in-patient and day-case waiting lists by treating patients faster. The numbers have gone from 7,264 patients waiting in March 2006 to 3,031 in March 2014. We now have just over 91 per cent of patients being seen and treated within 18 weeks of first referral at March 2014, compared with only 86 per cent in the quarter ending March 2007, despite a rise in the number of in-patient and day cases of more than 5.9 per cent in 2012-13. In addition, 99 per cent of patients were waiting at 31 March 2014 for less than the 12-week standard for first out-patient consultation, compared with 87 per cent in the quarter ending in March 2007. Those figures demonstrate the quality of the care that is being delivered in NHS Tayside, including in PRI, and the dedication of the staff in helping to achieve that.</p><p>There has been significant capital investment over recent years. My colleague Annabelle Ewing referred to the palliative care cancer unit at Perth royal infirmary&#8212;a &#163;6&#160;million investment with Macmillan Cancer Support that was completed in 2010&#8212;which has made a real difference. In addition, &#163;75&#160;million was invested in the new Murray royal hospital in Perth and there is the &#163;23&#160;million Rohallion unit there, which is a specialist unit for those with mental health issues.</p><p>As a Government, we recognise the important and valuable role that PRI has played over the past 100 years. It is important that we recognise and celebrate that. However, we also see PRI as an important setting for the delivery of high-class, quality services going forward. As a Government, we are determined to ensure that that continues to be the case.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;19:42.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Perth Royal Infirmary&#8217;s Centenary"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>I want to start with a recognition&#8212;no action that I can take today or words of comfort that I can offer will ever truly salve the pain of families who not only lost their precious children, but had to bear the burden of doubt about what happened to the ones they loved. That said, I offer my heartfelt condolences as a minister, as a member of this Parliament and as a father.</p><p>Since this issue first came to light, I have been clear that two areas need to be addressed and that steps have to be taken to ensure, first, that what happened can never be repeated, and secondly, that, as far as is possible, families who seek answers in their own cases can get them. The foundation for putting those safeguards in place has been the work of the infant cremation commission under the leadership of Lord Bonomy, and I take this opportunity to thank all the commission members, and those who submitted evidence to it, for their efforts. Lord Bonomy provided the commission&#8217;s final report to the Scottish Government last Thursday afternoon and it was published in full this morning.</p><p>During the process, Lord Bonomy visited a number of crematoriums across Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom and spoke to professionals across the health, funeral and cremation fields. The commission itself has analysed a large volume of documentation and information, and it has made 64 recommendations to prevent any repetition of these events. The Scottish Government has accepted those recommendations in full and without reservation.</p><p>Lord Bonomy made certain that parents had a voice in this process. He met parents on a number of occasions, including in the last month, when he shared with them a draft of his report for comment. The central focus on the bereaved family is reflected in the commission&#8217;s very first recommendation, which clearly states that the interests of the child and the bereaved family should be the central focus at all times.</p><p>Today we have published a response to each and every recommendation, setting out what we will do and when we will do it. Although not all the recommendations are directly for Government, our role will be to ensure that progress is made. The proposals that I am about to outline to the Parliament were agreed this morning by the Cabinet, which was chaired by the First Minister from Kirkwall, a commitment that he had made to the parents with whom we met on Thursday.</p><p>We will take forward a number of actions immediately. A number of recommendations highlight the need for a renewed legislative framework, not least in respect of the current definition of &#8220;ashes&#8221; as set down in the Cremation (Scotland) Regulations 1935. That definition is not fit for purpose; indeed, Dame Elish Angiolini identified the same issue in her report on Mortonhall.</p><p>It is likely that most, if not all, of the changes to law will require primary legislation. We are already committed to bringing forward a new burials and cremations bill, and we will publish a consultation on that new legislation by the end of this year. In the meantime, we will act to ensure that the operation of all crematoriums will already be compliant with the new legislative provisions when they come into force. Good practice does not need to wait for legislation.</p><p>The commission also recommends the establishment of a national committee, chaired by the Scottish Government, to have oversight in this area. We will begin work on establishing that committee immediately, with the first meeting taking place, if at all possible, over the summer. Affected parents will be key members of that group; indeed, they will be involved in all the activities that we undertake to respond to the commission&#8217;s recommendations.</p><p>A key first task will be to respond to recommendation 61, which asks the national committee to develop a code of practice for infant cremations. That will set out the minimum standards and best practice in relation to infant cremations. As I have already said, good practice does not need to wait for legislation, so the work on the code of practice will be prioritised. The code of practice will provide a robust foundation for all activities in this area.</p><p>The commission has also recommended that an inspector of crematoria be appointed with responsibility to monitor working practices at crematoria and with the authority to investigate complaints. I fully support that, and we will work to put the role in place as quickly as possible. Through the proposed legislation, we will also create powers to extend that inspection function to the funeral industry, as the commission recommends, to ensure that all parts of the cremation process are subject to independent scrutiny.</p><p>That work for the future is crucial, but for many parents questions remain about what happened in the past. Just last week, we learned about further allegations emerging in relation to Hazlehead crematorium in Aberdeen. Last year, Lord Bonomy published guidance for local authorities and private crematoria, advising how they should establish independent investigations where they were required, just as the City of Edinburgh Council established the independent investigation by Dame Elish Angiolini into the cases and practices at Mortonhall. It is very disappointing that every other affected cremation authority did not follow Lord Bonomy&#8217;s guidance and launch an independent investigation in the same way that Edinburgh did.</p><p>As I said earlier, the First Minister and I met some of the parents last week, and I welcome that a number of those parents are in the Parliament today to hear this statement. Last week, the parents told me that many of them still did not have the answers they needed about their own case. They spoke about having nowhere to go and not knowing where to turn, and they spoke very movingly about having to carry the burden of trying to find out what happened to their babies.</p><p>Every parent who has concerns must have their case investigated and they must get the individualised response that they need. The Edinburgh investigation provided that for the families affected by Mortonhall, and I believe that every family must have this same opportunity. For that reason, I am announcing today that we will launch an independent national investigation team, and I am grateful that Dame Elish Angiolini has kindly agreed to lead this work for us. Dame Elish and her team will be able to look at every document and every record. They will interview every concerned family and will expect to speak to any officials or staff members who may hold information. They will be able to investigate cremations in local authority crematoria and private crematoria. They will be able to look at the national health service and funeral directors as well as crematoria. Parents can be reassured that every step will be taken in order to find out what happened to their babies.</p><p>In addition to the investigation of individual cases, following last week&#8217;s announcement by Aberdeen City Council, I believe that there is now particular concern about practices at Hazlehead crematorium. Accordingly, Dame Elish has agreed that her investigation will look more broadly at practices there. If issues emerge in the course of the investigation about other crematoria, those too will be interrogated.</p><p>I should add that the remit for Dame Elish&#8217;s investigation will also include the requirement to refer to the Lord Advocate any evidence of criminality for investigation by Police Scotland. That is in keeping with the Mortonhall investigation remit.</p><p>The national investigation team is in place now, and parents can, from today, notify us if they wish their case to be investigated. They can do that by completing a simple form that is available on the Scottish Government website or that can be sent to them by post. It is difficult to know at this point how many parents will come forward, but we will support this work however long it takes.</p><p>This is not the end of the road, but the Mortonhall investigation and the cremation commission report are significant stepping stones along the way to where we want to go. However, we are not there yet and there is much still to be done. There are new laws to make, there are procedures and processes to update and there are individual cases and crematoria that we will now investigate.</p><p>Sadly, some parents will never know what happened to their children, but I hope that those parents recognise that we will do all that we can for them to get the answers that are available. I hope that all parents will recognise that the important legacy of the past 18 months is that this will never be able to happen again.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Infant Cremation Commission (Scottish Government Response)"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>I thank the member for his support for Lord Bonomy&#8217;s report. We should all be grateful for the work that the commission has undertaken and the way in which it has conducted the process of engaging with families.</p><p>The member spoke about sharing good practice across the UK. As he will be aware, Lord Bonomy has highlighted the issue of whether we should share the report&#8217;s advice and information with our counterparts in the rest of the UK, and we are more than willing to do that in a proactive way to ensure that they consider our findings and the work that we are undertaking to see whether they can learn any lessons. We do not want to see what happened in some of our crematoria in Scotland repeated anywhere else.</p><p>The establishment of the national committee is a key recommendation of Lord Bonomy&#8212;it is recommendation 57 in the report&#8212;and it is important that we achieve that as quickly as possible because of the role that the committee will have in developing an action plan for implementing all the recommendations. We want that committee to be made up of all the different stakeholders, including those parents who can be involved in it, and I am more than happy to look at the geographical spread of the parents who can be members of the committee. I also want the membership to include representative organisations from health, the funeral industry and local authorities, all of which have a part to play in taking the agenda forward.</p><p>An important part of the national committee&#8217;s early work will be the code of practice. If we establish that code of practice at an early stage, the measures that we will implement through legislation will already be in place.

I am keen to accept Lord Bonomy&#8217;s recommendation that we should look at how we can extend that inspection role to the funeral industry more generally, but that will require primary legislation. We will take that forward in the burials and cremations bill when it comes before the Parliament.</p><p>The member&#8217;s final point was about a public inquiry. It is extremely important that the families can have a full, thorough and rigorous investigation into their circumstances carried out. As I said in my previous statement on Mortonhall, a public inquiry would not deliver that for individual families. However, the national investigation unit will be able to ensure that a detailed, forensic examination is carried out in each case.</p><p>Of course, if something comes to light in the course of Elish Angiolini&#8217;s work that leads us to think that more must be done, we will consider that, but I believe that the very detailed work that Lord Bonomy has undertaken, along with the investigation work that Dame Elish Angiolini will now undertake, will provide us with a comprehensive picture of what has and what has not happened effectively in our crematorium system in Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Infant Cremation Commission (Scottish Government Response)"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>I welcome the member&#8217;s comments.

In spite of the social and economic barriers that have constantly worked against them, we have testimony of some seriously impressive heroines who have blazed a trail that we are rightly proud of.</p><p>Let us take a brief look back&#8212;further back than Christine Grahame went in her speech&#8212;at a few of our historical sisters. St Margaret of Scotland was born in exile in Hungary. She arrived, via Northumbria, in 1068, at what we now know as St Margaret&#8217;s Hope near North Queensferry, and married Malcolm III. Driven by her faith, she served the orphans and the poor every day before she ate. She established the Benedictine order&#8217;s monastery at Dunfermline, as well as the ferries between Queensferry and North Berwick. She was the power behind the restoration of the monastery at lona, too.</p><p>The opportunities for women to make an impact in Scotland in the 11th century were limited. My namesake, Christina, the sister of Robert the Bruce, moved matters along a bit a few centuries later. She commanded the garrison of Kildrummy castle and successfully held out against pro-Balliol forces led by David of Strathbogie, prior to their defeat by her husband, Sir Andrew Murray, at the battle of Culblean.</p><p>There is no lack of feistiness among our Scottish ancestors. Mary Slessor came out of the slums of Dundee and became a skilled jute worker before she decided to follow in the missionary footsteps of David Livingstone. She transformed the role of women in Nigeria, especially in her work with twins, who were regarded as an evil curse, rescuing hundreds of them. She adopted every pair that she found abandoned, taking a surviving twin&#8212;a girl&#8212;as her own daughter.</p><p>Elsie Inglis was an innovative Scottish doctor and suffragist who was not to be held back by tradition. Her dissatisfaction with the standard of medical care available to women led to her becoming politically active and playing an important role in the early years of the Scottish Federation of Women&#8217;s Suffrage Societies.</p><p>There are dozens more Scottish women worthy of mention, but I especially want to show how far forward we have moved and how much further we can travel in an independent Scotland.</p><p>Independence is about opportunity, prosperity and a mission for a sustainable economy. The word &#8220;mission&#8221; has broadened its meaning since Mary Slessor&#8217;s time but I am certain that she would understand the mission for equality that we are now striving for.</p><p>Professor Ailsa McKay, who died a few months ago at the age of only 50, taught me a lot about making a difference and about just how tenacious we need to be to succeed in making that difference.</p><p>Ailsa&#8217;s voice was crucial to the current SNP Government&#8217;s decision to commit to hugely extending childcare in Scotland in order to encourage more women to join or rejoin the workforce. She not only changed the culture at the University of Glasgow but worked very hard at helping to draw up Scottish Government policy on equality.</p><p>Westminster seems to take an entirely different view. Labour MP Austin Mitchell thinks that women prefer to discuss family and social issues rather than the big questions such as whether we should invade Iraq, and he does not think that there should be more women in Parliament because they would be preoccupied with family and social issues. Women MPs are, he says, &#8220;more leadable&#8221;, and the feminisation of Parliament will make MPs</p><p>&#8220;more preoccupied with the local rather than the international ... and small problems rather than big ideas and issues.&#8221;</p><p>If he seriously imagines that the big-ticket issues of the economy, austerity, jobs, investment, international affairs and future prosperity are of less concern to women than men, it would be a good idea for him to attend a few of the yes meetings that I have been at. Mr Mitchell is another glaring example of how Westminster is failing Scotland. More of that is what a no vote guarantees, and any woman in this chamber who does not see that is seriously kidding herself on.</p><p>Let us look at the previous and current generations of Scottish political women. I am talking about people such as Winnie Ewing, Margo MacDonald, Nicola Sturgeon, our very own Angela Constance and Roseanna Cunningham and, indeed, the rest of us MSPs&#8212;yes, I include all of us&#8212;who are determined to improve and are committed to improving the lives of our constituents and broader Scotland itself.</p><p>Earlier this week, I held in my arms a baby girl who was born in my constituency.

I especially want to commend her to our future Scotland, the one that recognises women and which, instead of seeing them as also-rans, realises that we are in there fighting for the same causes as the men. We are not that different; we are all driven by the same issues of fairness and equality and the same belief in our right to make our own decisions for ourselves. I am confident that Blair, who will be just a few months old when her parents vote on referendum day, will be an icon for our new generation of independent Scottish women.</p><p>We must put women in the space claimed by our ambassadors&#8212;the women whom I highlighted in my 1,000-year history of Scotland&#8212;but we must do it with a yes vote.

A freedom of information request to the MOD revealed that there had been 70 safety lapses across the UK in five and a half years.

Is anyone seriously suggesting that nuclear weapons will act as a deterrent to the Taliban?</p><p>I am not pretending that aggression is not a risk against which we must equip ourselves as far as practicable. I am saying categorically that nuclear weapons are not the way to do that. The reason that most countries in the world are trying to stop nuclear proliferation is very simple: they recognise that the more weapons of mass destruction are available, the more they will proliferate. Countries that had not considered acquiring the capacity start to feel under pressure. They think that they have to acquire it because everyone else is doing so. You know what? Halliburton will do them a great deal. That is not a good base upon which to build defence policy.</p><p>We have spent too long in enforced silence.

That takes me to another adventure. In 2008 I was very blessed to be able to join the Westminster Foundation for Democracy on a visit to Malawi, to encourage women to stand in the elections. We are delighted that some of the women that we know in Malawi have been re-elected and are still involved in Government and politics. I am equally delighted that the Scottish Government has announced its development fund to empower women in Malawi, which is important. Members of all parties and none in the Scottish Parliament have always had a commitment to the issue.</p><p>My travels took me from Lilongwe to Nkhata Bay and I was able to see many projects, which are run on different funding models. My attention was attracted to projects that have been supported by the Scottish Government, from support for cassava growers and sweet potato growers to projects to set up fish ponds. I saw villages that run on a truly co-operative system, trading in food and creating commerce, jobs and the freedom from poverty that Murdo Fraser talked about. It was interesting to watch the trade between villages&#8212;there would be arguments about who had the best fish or cassava pod, whether a big fish was worth two pods and so on.

If that can be continued, it will only be to the benefit of armed forces service personnel and their families.</p><p>The ASAP service started on 1 July 2010 and has had a total of 4,745 individual clients, which is a huge number. The clients&#8217; financial gain from the service ensuring that they get the benefits and payouts that they are entitled to now sits at &#163;3,241,000, which is a return of &#163;3 for every &#163;1 of funding that the project has received over the period. The people who come to the project have complex support needs and are seen on multiple occasions. Some of them have issues around debt and addiction, and the advice staff work on many complicated situations. Approximate figures for the issues that the project has dealt with over its four years show that 39 per cent were about benefits, 19 per cent were about debt, 8 per cent were about housing, 10 per cent were about financial issues, including grant applications, and 7 per cent were about employment. Members can see from that the work that the project does and the wraparound care that it provides to ensure that people get the right support.</p><p>Interestingly, the figures on referrals to the project have changed slightly. The total figure for self-referral and word-of-mouth referral is now 40 per cent, which is where we would want it to be because that is sometimes the best type of referral. Referrals from CABx are now at 11 per cent and those from SSAFA are at 8 per cent. The referral figures from the Veterans Welfare Service, the Royal British Legion Scotland, Poppyscotland and the armed forces welfare service are around 2 or 3 per cent. The 40 per cent self-referral figure probably comes from men and women veterans who are transitioning out of the armed forces talking to each other, which can only be a good thing.</p><p>I lodged a motion in Parliament a few weeks ago about the new ASAP service&#8212;I hope that all members have taken the opportunity to sign the motion&#8212;that involves working with Police Scotland. Alex Fergusson mentioned that 40 per cent of veterans land in prison. I hope that the new service will prevent some of that.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Armed Forces and Veteran Communities"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>Sorry.

However, the new service will address the people whom Alex Fergusson spoke about.</p><p>ASAP is working with a wide range of organisations, including Police Scotland, which will now help people to access the ASAP helpline. Police Scotland deals with people in a wide range of situations, but the biggest issue is keeping people safe. Some veterans come to the attention of the police because of issues in their community, but it can become apparent that they have mental health issues or suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. The police can now refer such people directly to the ASAP service, which can only be a good thing. Early indications are that the service is working extremely well.</p><p>In this year of the 100th anniversary of the start of the first world war, I finish by quoting from a statement to the House of Commons on the declaration of war.

In the first place, to fulfil a solemn international obligation ... an obligation ... of honour, which no self-respecting man could possibly have repudiated ... secondly, we are fighting to vindicate the principle ... that small nationalities are not to be crushed, in defiance of international good faith, by the arbitrary will of a strong and overmastering Power.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, House of Commons, 6 August 1914; vol 65, c 2079.]</p><p>I think that the armed forces commissioner will uphold all those standards and support and respect all our service personnel.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Armed Forces and Veteran Communities"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>One of the key themes of today&#8217;s debate has been inconsistency.

I want to focus on the issue of showing humanity and what that means.</p><p>About 13 years ago, when I was a Unison steward, I had a briefing from Margaret Wood of the Glasgow campaign to welcome refugees, and from that moment on I was involved in the campaign. At the same time, the Scottish Refugee Council started raising awareness, and I am very proud of this Parliament and this nation for marking refugee week every year.</p><p>One thing that was drawn to my attention when I worked in social work in Glasgow was the checks that young refugees were put through to determine their age. I do not mean to be totally alarmist, but the checks would have put Nazi Germany to shame, because wrists were measured, X-rays were taken and dental work was checked in order to determine a young person&#8217;s age&#8212;instead of just speaking to them and treating them as human.</p><p>Then we had the group who were fondly known as the Glasgow girls, whom we should all be very proud of, and their campaign against dawn raids. We witnessed on our tellies almost every night the people of Drumchapel, Castlemilk, Springburn and Sighthill standing up to UK Border Agency detention vans. Women in those areas were presented with Scottish women of the year awards. That shows a different Glasgow that is humane. Was the treatment of the refugees humane? That is the question.</p><p>I turn to the issue of Dungavel. For many years I have attended vigils at Dungavel run by justice and peace organisations from Lanarkshire and Ayrshire. The detention of innocent kids in Dungavel was brought to my attention because they were put next to some of the most notorious child traffickers in the world, who were awaiting deportation. Is that humane? I do not think so.</p><p>We should remember that those children are not criminals. I say to Alison McInnes that, although the Lib Dems ended the detention of children at Dungavel, the children just get shipped to Yarl&#8217;s Wood, Colnbrook or another centre. That is not a last resort. If members just listen to the testimony of people I know, they will hear that that is not a last resort.</p><p>UK Governments of all colours have been playing top trumps to see who is the hardest on immigrants, who is the hardest on asylum seekers and who is the hardest on refugees. Some of the things that I have seen over the years make me sick to my stomach.</p><p>Successive UK Governments have refused to sign up to EU directives to protect people, whether they are on asylum, men&#8217;s violence against women and children or trafficking. We have had go home vans and adverts. How disgusting.</p><p>The UKBA determines asylum status along with trafficked status and can deny a person protection all in the one envelope. That is disgusting and is not humane.</p><p>We have people who have been forced into destitution. We had the obscene pictures on our telly of Jacqui Smith chartering a plane, rounding up women and children at Brand Street in Govan, sending them back to the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo and telling them, &#8220;There, there&#8212;it&#8217;ll be all right once you&#8217;re home.&#8221;</p><p>We have the situation of young women from Moldova. Last week, we in the Parliament viewed the film &#8220;Nefarious: Merchant of Souls&#8221;. A young woman who was trafficked across Europe in horrific circumstances was brought to London. She was saved by the Poppy project, but she was denied refugee status and trafficked status and was sent back to Moldova. The decision was that she was not at risk. When she got there, the traffickers caught up with her. They abused her, beat her and did horrific things to her. A few months later, where was she? She was trafficked back to London. Is that humane? No.</p><p>Having an independent Scotland is one way to change that. We can have a humane system&#8212;a new asylum model that separates immigration from people who seek sanctuary. One of the most disgusting things about the process is the fact that people conflate those things, which dehumanises the individuals who are involved.</p><p>I want a system that provides protection, shows compassion and gives people dignity and support. I want a Scottish asylum agency that is underpinned by all those values and based on human rights. That is humane. That is the kind of Scotland that I want to live in.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers and Refugees"}, {"date": "2014-06-05", "body": "<p>There are now more female than male graduates, so it is shocking that young women should still be victims of outdated and ingrained chauvinism. At least half of the skills base for a new independent Scotland lies with women, whether they are graduates or not, but too many are still frightened to test out their entrepreneurial talent. One young woman told me that it is almost as if the culture is willing us to fail, that setting up a business is too big a gamble, and that we are somehow bound to fail.</p><p>That is an attitude that we have to take on head-on and break. Young women should go on, try it, and start out on their own. The worst that can happen is that their first attempt does not work out, but they might end up as the next Anita Roddick, for example. It is not so different from a first job, and it might not be where someone stays for all their life, but the experience gained will take them to the next turning in their life.</p><p>Increasing the number of women entrepreneurs to match the number of men would generate more than &#163;7 billion for our economy, which would have a huge impact. The Government wants to achieve that goal, and to make sure that the infrastructure is in place to encourage women, especially young women, to pick up and run with their entrepreneurial ideas.</p><p>Last week, at an event in the garden lobby that looked at aids and adaptations, I met Catherine Bland. Catherine had an accident that meant that she had to use crutches for a number of months. Not letting having crutches get in the way of her busy life, she developed a homemade product that she called the Hopper. It is essentially a big belt or apron with lots of pockets in it that holds everything needed for a busy day. She likes to bake, so she could carry all her baking stuff. When she wanted to read, she could carry her magazines and her phone. Other people could use it to carry their medication and other things. It is a brilliant idea, and Catherine developed that idea into a product that has helped to transform the lives of many people who have had injuries or have disabilities. It is a simple idea, but it is a brilliant idea.</p><p>There is a 13 per cent gap between men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s full-time hourly rates of pay, and a 33.7 per cent gap when we compare women&#8217;s part-time hourly rate with men&#8217;s full-time hourly rate. If we had any doubt that women are undervalued, what about the fact that parental childcare is not counted towards the gross domestic product and is considered to be leisure? Let us test that out. Many members will have brought up toddlers or spent time with them&#8212;did they call it leisure? In some cases it was, but a lot of it was hard work, and our skills in people management and negotiation are well honed in that situation.</p><p>Just seven of Scotland&#8217;s top 30 listed companies had a female executive two years ago. Only 37 of 242 board positions, executive and non-executive, in the top 30 companies were occupied by women in 2012. Even though there are annual increases, 27.6 per cent was the figure in 2012, which left 84.7 per cent of seats being filled by men.</p><p>Scottish women make up 52 per cent of the population, and in October 2013, female employment in Scotland reached its highest level since 1992 at 69 per cent. Let us look at the progress on that. Female self-employment has increased in recent years from 80,800 in 2008 to 93,900 in 2013, which is an increase of 16.2 per cent. At the moment, only 21 per cent of small and medium-sized enterprise employers are women-led, and only 31 per cent of self-employed Scots are women.</p><p>To address that enterprise gap, in 2013 the Scottish Government established a series of workshops chaired by Professor Sara Carter, former head of the Hunter centre at the University of Strathclyde, and Jackie Brierton of Women&#8217;s Enterprise Scotland. That is a great advance, and such a can-do attitude reaps great rewards.</p><p>As I said earlier, women now make up the majority of university graduates but we do not see that reflected in our boardrooms. The Scottish Government does not have the power to change that situation. We have some and we are doing what we can, but we need that yes vote to take it further. My colleague, cabinet secretary Shona Robison, says in her report &#8220;Women on Board: Quality through Diversity&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;Our aim for Scotland is to make the best use of talents of all of our people, regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or religion.&#8221;</p><p>I do not think that those are just words. The actions are being taken just now, and I believe that members from across the chamber support that.</p><p>By taking action on these issues and removing the barriers that stand in the way of women realising their potential, we will improve economic participation&#8212;&#163;7 billion-worth of economic participation. We will also contribute to making Scotland a wealthier and fairer place, which we all want, and ensure that no one is held back because of their gender and that public bodies are more fairly reflective of society as a whole.</p><p>We can improve the situation. We are already very active in listening and in challenging assumptions&#8212;I think that we all do that every day of our lives. We are encouraging employers to offer more flexible, home-based and part-time work. We are also seeking to get rid of the stereotyping that goes on in the modern apprenticeship programme: the cabinet secretary will be very well aware that one of my bugbears is seeing posters that show men with ladders, because they are building, and women with scissors, because they are cutting hair. I would like to swap that around. Let us give the women the ladders and the hard hats and the men the aprons and the scissors. I think that that would be great, but that is just a wee aside from me. We know that we have made great strides in apprenticeships and we continue to make those strides, but getting women into apprenticeships has to be a priority.</p><p>The most crucial and obvious change is in the transformational childcare policy. Once we raise the money to do that, the difference that it will make to the opportunities for women is threefold. There will be more women in work, which increases the tax take; more job opportunities in childcare to meet that aspiration; and a more positive, motivated outlook for women and their children.</p><p>History has dictated that women stay at home minding the children or elderly relatives. Not only do they not get paid for that; they give up any right to the career that they previously had. Poor supply and high costs of childcare prevent women from working. It is in recognition of that reality, and the follow-on truth that their absence constricts our economic growth, that this Government has promised an entirely different approach to childcare that will make that difference. We have the foresight to see that if we open the doors, women will come through into the workplace with competence and confidence. If we create those opportunities, the results are endless.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Improving Entrepreneurship among Women and Young People"}, {"date": "2014-06-04", "body": "<p>When last December the European and External Relations Committee started out on its inquiry into the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals for EU membership, I, like the rest of the committee, was very keen that we provide voters with a source of valuable information on the subject of EU membership itself. I recognised that some would be more persuaded by certain arguments than others, but my key objective was for the report to help voters understand more about the EU and what EU membership would mean for an independent Scotland. I did not expect the committee to agree on a number of the issues under consideration, but I hoped that a report would allow voters to find out more about EU membership and to make up their own minds.</p><p>All of the committee members have seen vast amounts of evidence and have listened to many excellent speakers, including academics, European Commission representatives, former senior civil servants and representatives of EU institutions across Europe. That evidence has been distilled into the committee&#8217;s second report, which was published on 23 May and with which I am sure colleagues are very familiar.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s inquiry lasted from last December until April and involved taking evidence from a wide range of experts on the EU, including former officials, academics and lawyers. We heard from those who supported the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals and those who did not, and we took evidence on a considerable range of issues related to the inquiry&#8217;s three themes: an independent Scotland in the EU; the road to EU membership; and the impact of small states in the EU. Indeed, our approach was so comprehensive that&#8212;as I was very flattered to note&#8212;the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee, which sat for one day on this topic, drew significantly on our evidence for its own report on Scotland&#8217;s membership of the EU.</p><p>As I think we have all learned over the past month, our membership of the EU is not by any measure a lightweight subject, and the historic challenges and accusations about too much bureaucracy, the waste of money, the ineffective policies and the overpaid civil servants continue to blight more intelligent debate on Europe. I thank all the witnesses who gave evidence to the committee, many of whom travelled from other EU member states to appear before us, and I also thank the organisations and individuals who made the great many written submissions that our inquiry received. They helped to ensure that the committee could draw on a rich seam of evidence. Finally, I thank the committee&#8217;s adviser, Dr Daniel Kenealy, for his expert advice and briefings.</p><p>Finally, I thank our clerks Clare O&#8217;Neill and Jenny Goldsmith, who were ably led by Dr Katy Orr. They put an amazing amount of work into this inquiry, using up some of their weekends to do so, and organised everything that we needed to inform what is a very comprehensive report.</p><p>The debate is topical, as it is being held shortly after the European elections, which saw the election of a large number of Eurosceptic members of the European Parliament in a number of countries across Europe, most notably in the United Kingdom, France and Denmark, but also in Austria and the Netherlands. In light of the European Parliament election results, I turn to the first theme of the inquiry, which was one of the three key themes that the committee explored: the value of EU membership to Scotland.</p><p>The evidence that the committee heard overwhelmingly supported an independent Scotland being a member of the EU, regardless of the witnesses&#8217; views on independence. We had many witnesses from both sides of the argument, but they generally agreed that being in the EU is a good thing.</p><p>The reality is that the EU is the main destination for Scotland&#8217;s international exports. In 2011, it accounted for around 46 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s international exports, with an estimated value of around &#163;11 billion. Those exports support a total of 110,000 full-time equivalent jobs. I draw members&#8217; attention to the importance of free movement and free trade, which helps to protect jobs in Scotland, and to the massive economic benefits that free trade in a market of more than 500 million people brings to us.</p><p>Many witnesses brought up all those topics, and many stressed the importance of EU membership in a very interconnected and globalised world. For example, Jim Currie, who is a former European Commission director general, stated:</p><p>&#8220;We live in a very interconnected world, in which one&#8217;s interests, whether they relate to trade, environmental standards or anything else, really depend on being part of something bigger, particularly if one is a small country on the edge of Europe.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, European and External Relations Committee, 20 February 2014; c 1806-7.]</p><p>That is notwithstanding the fact that many small countries on the edge of Europe are independent.</p><p>Other witnesses stressed the value of the European single market, which provides for the free movement of goods, people, services and capital within the EU, and gives individuals the right to live, work, study or retire in another EU member state. The impact of the EU single market in Scotland can be seen in a number of areas. Some 160,000 EU citizens from other member states now live in Scotland. They have helped to reverse Scotland&#8217;s population decline and make Scotland a more vibrant and multicultural society. Students from all over the EU are attracted to study in Scotland&#8217;s 19 world-class universities.</p><p>For Scottish businesses, the EU represents the main destination for Scottish exports, which have an estimated value of &#163;11 billion. As I said, they support 110,000 full-time equivalent jobs. Furthermore, Scotland benefits from the bilateral free trade agreements that the EU has negotiated with more than 50 partner countries all over the world. That is notwithstanding some of the challenges that have been raised with the transatlantic trade agreement, which we will perhaps consider at a later date.</p><p>We should not forget the EU&#8217;s contributions through its social agenda. The principle of equal treatment guarantees EU citizens minimum standards in legislation in relation to employment, with parental leave and sustainable working hours underpinned by EU legislation. The more common term that is used is &#8220;the social chapter&#8221;. There is also the commitment to non-discrimination, which is enshrined in article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. That states that the EU will</p><p>&#8220;combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.&#8221;</p><p>As members know very well, all those issues are very close to my heart.</p><p>Finally, we should not forget the benefits that EU funding has brought to Scotland over the years. I am sure that everyone in the chamber is familiar with projects&#8212;whether they are employability, infrastructure or research projects&#8212;that have been funded by European moneys. In the previous funding period, between 2007 and 2013, Scotland received &#8364;4.5 billion in common agricultural policy funding and around &#8364;800 million in European structural funding.</p><p>During the inquiry, we were reminded of how the European Union has brought stability to Europe. As Professor Sir David Edward told the committee, the European project was initially related to the prevention of European wars and bringing stability to the continent. Many witnesses raised the interesting proposition that, as individuals in the EU, we have rights conferred on us as EU citizens. That is a separate seam that should be investigated a bit further.</p><p>The committee sought to explore public attitudes to EU membership in Scotland with a view to establishing whether Scots support EU membership. I will draw on the 2013 Scottish social attitudes survey to consider that question. That survey asked respondents whether, in the event of independence, Scotland should be a member of the EU. Some 34 per cent said that Scotland should definitely be a member of the EU; 34 per cent said that it should probably be a member; 12 per cent suggested that it should probably not be a member; and only 12 per cent considered that it should definitely not be a member. That seems to provide clear evidence of support in Scotland for EU membership.</p><p>In considering the value of EU membership to Scotland, we did not neglect to take evidence on the alternatives. We heard very interesting evidence from officials from the European Free Trade Association on membership of the European economic area. We took most of that evidence by videoconference, but some of the officials came over to Scotland to give evidence.</p><p>It was great to explore what EFTA means, how we can understand it and how it works. In addition to the views of other witnesses, that evidence pointed to the lack of formal opportunities for Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein to influence EU decision making, despite the fact that they need to implement large proportions of EU legislation to access the single market and contribute to the EU budget. Thus, being a member of EFTA and the European economic area does not represent a desirable alternative for an independent Scotland. I am sure that there are others who will disagree with that, but the weight of evidence suggests that that is not desirable.</p><p>The second theme that the committee considered as part of its inquiry was the road to EU membership&#8212;it was probably the hottest topic in the inquiry&#8212;and how Scotland would become a member state in its own right. This theme was the subject of the majority of evidence that was received and the one on which there were the most divergent views. As one of the witnesses joked, if you get four lawyers in a room you will get eight different opinions on what might happen.</p><p>Much of the discussion focused on whether article 48 or article 49 of the Treaty on European Union provided the legal basis for an independent Scotland&#8217;s membership of the EU, but there was also a considerable amount of evidence that suggested that the legal route would be tailored to the situation at hand. Many witnesses suggested that the UK and EU would find a way to sort any problems, as the EU is very pragmatic in that regard. For instance, Professor Laura Cram argued that</p><p>&#8220;the lawyers will come up with a compromise. We may have an article 49 process that, in practice, looks more like an article 48 process.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, European and External Relations Committee, 16 January 2014; c 1660.]</p><p>I suspect that the legal route for membership will be a key focus of the debate today, and I will leave other members to debate that. However, I think that it is important to be aware of the many examples of pragmatism in the history of the European Union. I draw members&#8217; attention to evidence that Mr Graham Avery gave in that regard to our committee and to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. An RSE report stated:</p><p>&#8220;Mr Avery called it &#8216;absurd and unlikely&#8217; that an independent Scotland would have to go through the same EU accession process is a non-member state, and proposed to outline &#8216;a common sense approach&#8217; to Scotland&#8217;s accession to the EU.&#8221;</p><p>The third theme that the committee took evidence on as part of the inquiry was that of the role of small states in the European Union. We had an evidence session with members of&#8212;I might not get this pronunciation right&#8212;the Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, who provided examples of the success that Ireland has had over the years in influencing EU policy making, particularly when it held the presidency of the European Council. I am sure that there are very few people across Europe who would not describe that presidency as very successful, because many issues that had taken a while to come to fruition were finally resolved.</p><p>We also heard of examples of the ways in which small member states have successfully focused their efforts in order to influence EU policy. We heard that small states work together to solve problems that individual states could not solve on their own. There is a lot of collaborative working among them, but each state maintains its independence and policy pragmatism. For example, we heard how Denmark had pursued the development of labour market policies and how Luxembourg&#8217;s priorities were linked to the financial sector.</p><p>It was suggested that Scotland, as a member state, could contribute in the fields of research, agricultural policy and energy policy, particularly in relation to renewables, which held a lot of interest for the witnesses whom we had at committee. They were very keen to point out the clear benefits of renewables, the areas where Scotland is leading the way in them, and how we can continue to do that.</p><p>I hope that I have given members a taste of some of the evidence that emerged from the inquiry. I would strongly recommend the committee&#8217;s report to anyone who is interested in learning more about an independent Scotland&#8217;s membership of the EU. The report is comprehensive but very straightforward.</p><p>Again, I thank everyone who was involved in the report: committee colleagues, committee clerks, everyone who gave evidence and our adviser. I commend the report to members.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Independent Scotland (European Union Membership)"}, {"date": "2014-06-03", "body": "<p>I thank all colleagues across the chamber who have signed the motion and supported the great work of One Parent Families Scotland, which has allowed us to have the debate.

I was enormously impressed when, in my constituency, I heard the stories of young single mums who had been benefiting from the mentoring of folk from One Parent Families Scotland on its transforming lives programme.</p><p>That programme really transforms lives. The young mums go from the start of the process to the awards ceremony. They make progress, they have aspirations, they set goals and they form strong bonds with the women they meet on that journey.</p><p>The young mothers I met at Whitehill neighbourhood centre in Hamilton were a testament to the difference that it makes when people have strong local support in their life.

One of the main things that I have seen at awards ceremonies is the confidence and trust that young mums have developed in Margaret and her team. They trust them implicitly, take advice, guidance and support and make lifelong friendships. As Margaret has said:</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about being smart or academic, it&#8217;s about real life; about having the opportunities that will allow you to make a real contribution for yourself, for your child and for the wider community too.&#8221;</p><p>Benefits in the United Kingdom are tightening all the time and young mothers are an easy target for Westminster&#8217;s austerity regime. The Scottish Government believes that this country&#8217;s children are our future, and we are proving that with our commitment to transformational childcare. That was the word &#8220;transformational&#8221; again. The word &#8220;transformation&#8221; is a very important word in the debate.</p><p>Today&#8217;s Daily Record reveals that, after asking for the Scottish Government&#8217;s input to a report on implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Westminster Government withheld the Scottish Government&#8217;s position from the final report. In that final report, the Westminster Government claimed that welfare changes will help to reduce child poverty. It completely failed to include any reference to the Scottish Government&#8217;s position that Westminster&#8217;s welfare cuts will only make child poverty worse.</p><p>Last week, Save the Children warned that the number of children who live in poverty in the UK is set to rise by 41 per cent, from 3.5 million to 5 million, by 2020 as a result of flat wages, cuts to benefits and the rising cost of living. That is an amazing and unbelievable figure. Every single one of those 5 million is a small child.</p><p>Poverty is a man-made problem, but it can be unmade, too. However, the Westminster Government seems hell-bent on continuing its destructive policies, and the children here are the biggest losers.</p><p>We should contrast that with the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach. Through the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014, we are already increasing the available free hours to 600 a year. Come independence, the Scottish Government will go much further: if we are re-elected, we will introduce 1,140 hours of free childcare for pre-school children. That is the equivalent of a full school week, and that will help not only to close the attainment gap; it will help mothers and fathers to fulfil their own ambitions with the support of our society behind them.</p><p>The amazing women I met in Hamilton are excited by that prospect. They see how it can open opportunities for both them and their children. They were amazed when I told them that, in Norway, the economic impact of women in the workforce is equivalent to that of the country&#8217;s oil income.</p><p>Scotland cares about its future generations and we want to see every child, as well as every parent, fulfilling his or her hopes and ambitions. I have no doubt that many of my colleagues across the chamber feel the same, although perhaps we disagree on the method of achieving that aspiration and transformation for our children.</p><p>With a yes vote in September, we can look forward to building on the fantastic support services that One Parent Families Scotland already has in place and to truly transforming the lives of mums and dads, and more important, the lives of our children.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: One Parent Families Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>The topic of immigration preoccupied most of the UK during the European elections. With the wall to wall media coverage of the UK Independence Party, we in Scotland have been subjected to a tirade of one-subject campaigning. All that completely distorts the reality here.</p><p>Only since 2003 has the number of people coming to Scotland consistently exceeded the number of those leaving, and it will take us quite a while to make up the deficit. Natural population growth has not helped to make up for the loss of people to emigration.</p><p>Interestingly, England&#8217;s position is diametrically opposed. Although we added an average of just 2,667 people a year during the past three decades, net migration into&#8212;mostly&#8212;England was 2.92 million in just one decade between 2001 and 2011.</p><p>We need people, especially young people, to come here and make a positive contribution to our culture, our economy and our communities. Without immigration we are going to find it hard, if not impossible, to sustain a workforce large enough to help to pay the pensions of those retiring. Some of us here may be a bit closer to retiring than others.</p><p>However, Westminster seems utterly determined to restrict the number of people coming to the UK in any way that it can. The UK has dumped tier 1 post-study work visas and replaced them with graduate entrepreneur visas, which have been capped at 1,000 students and made it increasingly difficult for non-EU citizens to work here.</p><p>Many of those students take courses in modern business methods, including MBA degrees, but rather than offering them an easy opportunity to start their careers in Scotland we are sending them straight back into the arms of our competitors abroad. It is a crazy policy that is driven by a perceived problem that does not even apply in Scotland.</p><p>Of course, as we know, immigration policy is reserved. If the Home Office wants to festoon Scottish buses or visa offices with advertisements telling people to go home, there is absolutely nothing we can do about it. If any Westminster Government wants to take back or stop any policy it has implemented, it can do so at any time. That is the point of this whole debate: we can develop new and appropriately designed policies only with the leverage that comes with independence; without that independence, we cannot stop the Tory Westminster Government taking away the fresh talent initiative, capping student visas or anything else. This is yet another example&#8212;a big and crucial example&#8212;of how we are definitely not better together.</p><p>At an economic level, evidence in the Institute for Fiscal Studies report&#8212;it is in chapter 4&#8212;has established that a Scottish migration system could improve our fiscal balance by &#163;1.6 billion a year. Just last month, the principal of the University of Glasgow&#8212;we have heard a lot about him today&#8212;criticised Westminster&#8217;s approach to migration legislation, saying that the universities&#8217; links across the world were under threat. He pointed out that</p><p>&#8220;you begin to see how people have perceived what the UK has been doing in the immigration space so negatively&#8221;,</p><p>and he suggested that it was like putting up a sign saying &#8220;Closed for business&#8221; or &#8220;Closed for education&#8212;don&#8217;t come here&#8221;.</p><p>Those are strong and powerful words from the principal of the University of Glasgow, an institution with a centuries-long tradition of providing education. We know that in Scotland we punch well above our weight with regard to equality and the ambition of our further and higher education institutions. As for research grants, I must point out that they are based on merit, not geography. Can we just get rid of that red herring here and now?</p><p>Scotland has been an educational leader since the early part of the 15th century, and it is home to some of the world&#8217;s oldest and most prestigious universities as well as some of the finest specialist vocational and modern institutions. Highly educated working-age graduates who are likely to be keenly ambitious generate more taxes, and they will settle and have their children in this country and contribute greatly in many ways&#8212;not just financially&#8212;to it.</p><p>Each year, Scotland attracts more than 40,000 students from across the world. During their studies, they are net contributors to the economy&#8212;indeed, they contribute &#163;779 million annually&#8212;but most are compelled to return home once they graduate because of a daft short-sighted policy that ensures that their brains do not get used. In an independent Scotland, we could create incentives to encourage these young people to establish themselves in Scotland. By having an international mix of identities, we would, as a nation, benefit not only economically but across the cultural and social spectrum.</p><p>Westminster is damaging our economy. Both Universities Scotland and the University and College Union Scotland have criticised its draconian approach to immigration and student visas. It makes no sense to train experienced, gifted graduates in Scotland only to force them to leave as soon as they have qualified.</p><p>I will finish on this point: the can&#8217;t-do attitude of the better together parties in the chamber today epitomises the very reason why we need independence.

Like many others, I shared the surprise when the judges decided that Motherwell&#8217;s Reece McFadden, who should have been on his way to gold, would have to settle for a bronze medal.</p><p>Last, but definitely not least, I thank the volunteers, who all did such a magnificent job, and everyone who worked with the national teams or at events and who was out and about helping the public to make the most of the games.</p><p>Of course, we hope that all the success, added to the experience of those who visited and those who watched around the world, will have a lasting legacy. As the minister said, there are good reasons to hope that that will be the case, not least of which is the way in which the Commonwealth games took advantage of the Olympic games in London that preceded them. That helped with the development of facilities and the performance of sportspeople throughout the UK. North Lanarkshire&#8217;s facilities will, I hope, bring the British transplant games here in 2017. I am sure that the Parliament will join me in wishing the council every success in its bid.</p><p>Many sports are supported at a UK level, with UK-wide facilities. There is also tremendous UK co-operation and camaraderie in all sports. The Olympics provided the template and the platform for the games and both were utilised in the planning of Glasgow 2014; it also encouraged the growth of public interest in a wide range of sports.</p><p>These really were the friendly games, as all competitors were given great support and all visitors warmly welcomed. That was often especially true for the supposed auld enemy, with English athletes being rousingly cheered to victory. We now have to take the combined achievements of the UK and its nations, competing together and in friendly rivalry, and build on that to take Scottish and UK sport to the next level.</p><p>The Commonwealth games legacy for Scotland exists at many levels. There are the obvious and often highlighted economic aspects, such as regeneration, tourism and international trade, as well as the benefits for sport and the consequences of that for better health. Some of the benefits are not so obvious, such as boosting social capital. That is one part of the legacy that has to be harnessed&#8212;not tomorrow, next week or after the referendum but immediately.</p><p>Some of the volunteers will be involved in various forms of activity; for others I heard talking about the games, it was an invigorating new experience.

At Braidhurst high school there is a school of football, which involves Motherwell Football Club Community Trust. There are also youth and arts programmes, such as SPL music box, which also involves Motherwell FC.</p><p>The new opportunities project in north Motherwell is a good example of how cashback can benefit communities. It was set up by North Motherwell parish church minister Derek Pope and his wife and project worker Helen, and it involves St Bernadette&#8217;s church. It is funded through Inspiring Scotland&#8217;s programme, link up.</p><p>The project draws on strengths in the community, building on the many skills and talents that local people have to offer. It has about 50 regular volunteers, who run a community cafe, a running club, a youth club and groups for arts and crafts, women and parents and toddlers. The project engages with about 200 people per week and can evidence the benefits of developing networks and friendships, tackling isolation, building confidence and self-esteem, contributing to health and wellbeing and enabling volunteers to acquire skills that will help them to gain employment. The project is inclusive. Last month it held an international women&#8217;s evening, which brought together 80 women from six different nationalities.</p><p>That is the good news. Let us just think how much better it could be if we tackled the very poor record on asset recovery. The figures for the UK show that just a quarter of 1 per cent of criminal proceeds are confiscated, with only 2 per cent of confiscation orders paid in full. As Graeme Pearson said, the Scottish Government is unable to say whether the Scottish figures are better or worse.</p><p>If we had the figures, we would be able to see whether we are making progress. Work needs to be done on that, but I am concerned that the issue will be parked until after the referendum, as is happening with other important issues. Perhaps when he sums up the debate the cabinet secretary will tell us when work will start.</p><p>There are also questions about the distribution of the money that is recovered. Are funds distributed on the basis of who shouts loudest&#8212;or even who knows how to ask&#8212;rather than on the basis of need? If we take child poverty as a measure of need, North Lanarkshire Council is not in the worst position. Its rate is 21 per cent, which puts it in eighth place in the list of local authorities, just behind other authorities that have been mentioned. However, there is significant variation in the council area, which includes areas of very high deprivation. Despite that, per capita expenditure from cashback has been just 85 per cent of the Scottish average. Although North Lanarkshire is in the top quarter of local authorities in relation to need, it ranks 22nd&#8212;just outside the bottom quarter&#8212;in expenditure per young person.</p><p>That works out at just over a fiver a year per young person. North Lanarkshire had only 3.9 per cent of the total activities and opportunities that were funded&#8212;to put it another way, in the course of six years there has been less than one opportunity per young person. Only one area had fewer activities in terms of the population that it serves. North Lanarkshire is an example of how the system is not targeting funds in the way that it should be doing.</p><p>The amount recovered might be a lot less than we hope, but even then, is what we do recover getting through to the intended users? We have heard that it is getting diverted to areas that should receive direct funding, replacing funds that were previously met by the Scottish Government. In particular, is the Scottish Government planning to use the proceeds of crime to fund policing? Are the proceeds of crime already being used to plug the gaps left by Government cuts? Again, the cabinet secretary might want to answer those questions in his summing up.</p><p>I note that funding enhanced recovery was mentioned in a response to a parliamentary question that confirmed that the Scottish Government had advised that it is content to proceed with a budget that includes the receipt of POCA money. Are the police recovering money to pay for the police who are recovering the money?

It was backed by service users, carers, clinicians, NHS managers, council partners, voluntary organisations and on several occasions by the health secretary at the time, Nicola Sturgeon, who saw the improvements that that robust plan would bring across the board, including to Monklands. They saw the bigger picture.</p><p>The plan would have funded a new intensive psychiatric care unit for NHS Lanarkshire, which was the only mainland board without one. It would also have supported the development of intensive home treatment and young people&#8217;s services, greatly expanded community mental health, and provided a safer and more sustainable medical rota.

Yes, we want to modernise Scottish courts; yes, we want to make the system more efficient; and yes, we want it to be less expensive and more accessible to users. However, it is not the stated aims but the measures that are supposed to deliver them that require scrutiny. I am concerned that some of the bill&#8217;s proposals appear to erode rather than strengthen users&#8217; rights. Of course, that issue can be addressed at stage 2, and I hope that the Scottish Government will be consensual and accept Opposition amendments.</p><p>One of the main areas of dispute in the bill is the value of cases to be moved from the Court of Session to the sheriff court&#8212;a matter that was reviewed by Sheriff Principal Taylor. With regard to the proposal for the sheriff court to have a privative jurisdiction of &#163;150,000, Sheriff Principal Taylor admitted that the figure was not chosen on the basis of the percentage of cases that would be moved from the Court of Session to the sheriff court; instead, he referred to it as &#8220;a judgment call&#8221;. In other words, it was simply what he considered to be appropriate for determination by a sheriff, and the highest amount that would be appropriate for the sheriff court. It was not chosen after consideration of the practical consequences for the functioning of courts.</p><p>Sheriff Principal Taylor also told the committee that, although the average sum that is sued for is more than &#163;150,000, the average sum that the pursuer receives is less than a third of that. We can see from the figures the number of cases that would transfer and the pressure that that would put on the sheriff courts.</p><p>There are significant doubts about whether funding and resources are adequate to back up the proposals. If they are not, it could result in delays for those who use the courts system, and it could have other adverse impacts. I therefore call on the Scottish Government to give assurances that it will address that issue if the figures in its financial memorandum are shown to be overly optimistic.</p><p>We must also address inequality of arms. The restriction of litigants&#8217; access to counsel is a matter of widespread concern, and many people would be happier if the bill were amended to ensure that it will not introduce obstacles to achieving equality of arms. Trade unions and solicitors have argued that, particularly in personal injury cases, victims of every workplace injury and disease must be entitled to raise their actions at the specialist personal injury court and have the automatic right to access, or a presumption in favour of accessing, representation by counsel.

It is understandable that, at a time when high-profile millionaire celebrities and multinational companies have been highlighted, the focus of deliberations on taxation is on that issue. It has become apparent that the public care more deeply than ever that we do not have a tax system that permits freeloaders.</p><p>The Scottish Government has got the balance just about right in legislating on how revenue Scotland will be tasked with dealing with avoidance and evasion within its responsibilities. There is flexibility in the rules but enough clarity to ensure that the rules are firm enough to follow. The amendments that the cabinet secretary has made and accepted have helped to clarify some areas in which there was originally some doubt. We had to get it right, because tax avoidance could have serious implications for business as a whole. There could also be implications for the public perception of our tax system. The system must maintain public confidence, and the perception that others can avoid their responsibilities can damage that confidence.</p><p>The clear view of the tax professionals who gave evidence to the Finance Committee was that the level of public scrutiny 10 years ago was much less than it is now. We heard that tax avoidance is not necessarily any greater than it was in years gone by, but that the greater public awareness of all the issues means that, when certain individuals or companies do not contribute their fair share to the public purse, there is a heightened sense of outrage. Those concerns are justified, which is why, when avoidance occurs, we have to make it easier to take action. I believe that the bill will do that.</p><p>In relation to the landfill tax, any avoidance could create economic distortions, as a business could seek a competitive advantage by acting illegally to avoid paying tax. I have visited the new Scottish Environment Protection Agency premises at the Maxim Park development at Eurocentral in my constituency and was pleased to meet the dedicated team of investigators who have been tasked with pursuing companies that, by many and varied means, seek to avoid paying landfill tax. That effort is already bearing fruit and I am confident that, increasingly, we will clamp down on those who try to dodge their responsibilities.</p><p>I therefore have no hesitation in endorsing the bill and I congratulate the cabinet secretary on guiding it so effectively to this point.

I will ask a question that has occurred to me. This bill and the two others that resulted from the further devolution of tax powers under the Scotland Act 2012 sailed through the legislative process on a sea of good will and widespread agreement. When the cabinet secretary came to the Finance Committee last week, his exasperation was evident that closure on the technical details of the block grant adjustment that is required under the new tax laws has not yet been achieved.</p><p>If the cabinet secretary cannot conclude in 18 months the process for a system that covers only 1.7 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s income, with all the parties involved in total agreement on its desirability and efficacy, how on earth does he expect to negotiate, agree and deliver an entire transfer of powers, set up and conclude applications for membership of NATO, the European Union and other bodies and set up a currency union all within 18 months of a yes vote in September? I do not expect the cabinet secretary to answer that, or to have to answer it, because it is a purely hypothetical question.</p><p>I thank him for his efforts in bringing the devolved taxes to fruition and I look forward to seeing how revenue Scotland uses the powers that have been given to it to the betterment of our system of taxation in Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>I welcomed the prospect of this debate on welfare when I learned that it had been scheduled, because it is absolutely right that the people of Scotland should hear from the Scottish Government how it plans to introduce its robust, effective, reliable and affordable welfare system in an independent Scotland.

Recently, I was reading about the work of Ron Kramer, a sociologist at Western Michigan University who has been studying how sociological factors are preventing Americans from acting on climate change.

First is &#8220;literal denial&#8221;, which is</p><p>&#8220;the assertion that something did not happen or is not true.&#8221;</p><p>Secondly, he explains &#8220;interpretive denial&#8221; in which the basic facts are not denied but</p><p>&#8220;are given a different meaning from what seems apparent to others.&#8221;</p><p>Thirdly, he outlines &#8220;implicatory denial&#8221;, which covers how</p><p>&#8220;knowledge itself is not an issue ...the challenge is doing the &#8216;right&#8217; thing with this knowledge.&#8221;</p><p>A short time after reading about that thesis on climate change denial, I came to read the European and External Relations Committee Report that we are debating this afternoon.

I believe that the arguments of Professor Kenneth Armstrong and Jean-Claude Piris outweighed those of Graham Avery. They all provided weighty evidence, but one side outweighed the other. I am left in no doubt from reading the report that the direction from the European Court of Justice points to article 49 as being the appropriate legal route to membership, rather than article 48.</p><p>Article 48 deals with treaty revisions between member states, but Scotland is not a member state. It is important that opening up the Treaty on European Union could result in other revisions being proposed by other member states, which could delay the process of accession very considerably.

To be fair, there was plenty of both, but there was also the fun of watching lawyers and accountants arguing against one another to see who should have the greater right to make money out of advising people on how not to pay as much tax as they might otherwise. Had we taken evidence on the bill from a librarian and added it to what we heard from the lawyers and accountants, we would certainly have had all the information that we needed, but we would not have understood a word of it.</p><p>In truth, though, all the witnesses we heard from recognised that the bill is well drafted and in general delivers what is expected of it, so great credit is due to the team that prepared it. The fact that the lawyers as well as the accountants were left slightly disappointed is the best indicator that I could see that the right balance has been struck.</p><p>It was probably inevitable that in our evidence sessions most of the attention focused on the general anti-avoidance rule. It appears to be sufficiently robust for us to have confidence in it but, as is ever the case, much will depend on the guidance and regulations that follow. Of course, there can be no guarantees that a good tax accountant could not still have a loophole named after them.</p><p>Mr Swinney has underlined again today the Scottish Government&#8217;s intention to take a tough stance on tax avoidance and there is a widespread welcome for that, and an acceptance that the approach must be robust. However, I remain uncertain that the cabinet secretary has clarified entirely that principles-based drafting of any future Scottish taxes will alleviate the need for a targeted anti-avoidance rule in respect of the taxes. We took plenty of evidence on that.</p><p>I understand that it is desirable to keep complexity out of reliefs and exemptions, and there is a strong view that that will minimise the scope for avoidance activity, but I remain sceptical that parliamentary statements and guidance on the intention behind tax legislation are sufficient to ensure that tax tribunals and the courts can impose the spirit as well as the letter of the law. That will depend on how the board and related bodies work with one another. The committee asked whether it could get further clarification and we still require to explore that issue further.</p><p>That is not to say that I believe that the bill is flawed; it was merely a comment on a difference of opinion on the desirability of relying solely on the GAAR rather than having a plan B, and a targeted anti-avoidance rule. If we had a TAAR from the outset, we could look forward to the devolution of more tax powers over time and be confident that a principles-based rather than a rules-based approach could be developed as we move forward.</p><p>There has been much discussion this afternoon about Adam Smith&#8217;s maxims and the principles-based approach. That leads me to a small point that I raise in order to bring something different to the debate. It is not a serious disagreement with the cabinet secretary, but he is aware that I think that he is wrong in his decision not to include the amount of tax that Scots will pay through the Scottish rate of income tax in their pay slips.</p><p>I appreciate that that information will be provided in someone&#8217;s P60, but all tax paid can be found on that form. Scots should not have to wait until the end of the tax year to know in respect of the SRIT what they know from week to week or month to month in respect of their income tax. I have no evidence to back up what is nothing more than a gut feeling that there is something inherently wrong in people not being able to see in their pay slip what they are paying in tax. A lot of people have worked on that principle.

We can hold Governments to account in many ways, one of which is by knowing how much we are being taxed.

Amongst others I have worked with are my good friends Jeremy Corbyn MP of Labour and the Liberal Democrat Baroness Sue Miller. I have worked with them and spoken to them at many international conferences overseas on achieving our joint aim of a world without nuclear weapons.</p><p>With that in mind, I believe that we should all see today as an opportunity to think about how Scotland, as the sole repository of the entire UK nuclear weapons arsenal, should look towards the removal of Trident and the timescale for that. As a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the UK has a duty to work towards ending these weapons of mass destruction. It is our duty here, whether as unilateralists or multilateralists, to work in honest good faith to achieve that end, not just to talk about it.</p><p>That must mean not upgrading or replacing Trident, at a cost of up to &#163;100 billion, with the intention&#8212;because it is the intention of the British Government to do so&#8212;to maintain that system for the next 40 to 50 years. That does not demonstrate good faith with the NPT. It is our duty to work towards nuclear disarmament as quickly as possible. That is because we represent not only the people of Scotland but people around the world who believe that nuclear weapons are a danger to us all.</p><p>Why not continue to keep established nuclear weapons such as Trident? One or two voices in the wilderness are crying out, &#8220;Nuclear weapons are a good thing. They&#8217;ve stopped us from having wars.&#8221; I have not noticed them stopping us from having wars&#8212;there are plenty of wars going on. They might not be nuclear wars, but they are wars. In other words, Trident has not stopped a single war; there just has not been a nuclear war.</p><p>Nuclear weapons are not a force of nature. As Patrick Harvie said, they are not a magic genie from a bottle. They are an invention of man. They do not keep us safe in perpetuity because, like all man-made equipment, they are capable of failure. Like Karl Wallenda, the greatest tight-rope walker ever, we can walk the rope, suspended in the air, day and daily for more than 60 years, but one day, as unfortunately happened to Mr Wallenda, even with great skill and knowledge our luck can run out and devastating tragedy will be the outcome.</p><p>It might be asked, &#8220;What good are nuclear weapons against cybercrime, or in the war against illegal drugs? What good are they in the battle against the criminal madness of ISIS&#8212;the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria&#8212;as it rampages across the middle east? What good are nuclear weapons against the terror threats on our own shores?&#8221; Long-term security without nuclear deterrence involves investment in international cross-border co-operation and conventional armed forces.</p><p>From major military figures such as General Sir Hugh Beach, former master general of the ordnance of the British forces; General Ramsbotham, former commander of the field army; General Bernard Norlain, former chief of the French air force; to my friends and colleagues who have worked at the sharp end of missile delivery in the Royal Navy, retired Lieutenant Commanders Feargal Dalton and Robert Green&#8212;all of those are officers who have had to see oversee nuclear weapons in the real world. All of them believe that Trident has no utility to the military. All of them would rather have fully trained and equipped forces to defend their people than a genie with a magic wand that is supposed to cause fear in the ranks of enemies and keep us safe for ever.</p><p>Yesterday, in committee room 3, I held a meeting with guest speakers: the international lecturer and author Ward Wilson, who is in the gallery, and Bruce Kent of CND UK, who has said that he supports Scottish independence as a faster route to getting rid of Trident. It was a great meeting. It said a great deal. On top of that, I just received an email from the former mayor of Hiroshima, Tadatoshi Akiba, who says that he is looking forward to a successful debate today in the Scottish Parliament, paving the way to an independent Scotland joining the 2020 vision of a world free of nuclear weapons.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-05-13", "body": "<p>As members can see, the sun shines on the righteous. Perhaps I should move to another desk.</p><p>I am both pleased and saddened to bring this members&#8217; business debate to the chamber. I am pleased because I am very proud of the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s commitment across the parties to see justice done for the victims of asbestos exposure and asbestos-related illnesses, but I am, obviously, saddened because I know that we will hear from other members that the rate of deaths from asbestos exposure continues to rise.</p><p>The disease can work on a victim without there being many&#8212;if any&#8212;outward signs for a long period of time, and it can therefore lead to diagnosis and registration as a victim of asbestosis well after the initial exposure occurred. People with asbestos-related symptoms therefore continue to be identified. As well as that, there is often, even now, asbestos in the fabric of public buildings, including schools, and there are continuing dangers of exposure if it is disturbed in any way.</p><p>It is therefore incumbent on us in the Parliament to speak out on behalf of our fellow citizens who, through the work of generations, built the economy of our country and, in doing so, were left exposed to that dangerous material and to suffer the consequences later in life. That is consistent with calls from Clydeside Action on Asbestos, the Scottish hazards campaign and the Scottish Trades Union Congress for the recovery of costs and compensation for those who are affected. The medical evidence is very complex, but the truth is that a large number of people are ill, very ill or even terminally ill and need a swift resolution to any claims for compensation.</p><p>The dangers of asbestos have been known since at least 1945, but there are difficulties of diagnosis due to the conditions&#8217; similarities with other conditions, and issues of legal divisibility, which arise from workers having had a number of employers with which they may have been exposed to asbestos and may have contracted illness from it, are often raised. In spite of all that, we still know that asbestos diseases exercise a terrible hold on the lives of many. I have therefore felt the need to raise in the Parliament again the issue of asbestos in the lives of Scottish communities, such as those in my constituency of Glasgow Anniesland, which, as most people know, has a shipbuilding and heavy engineering background in which asbestos exposure was rife over many years.</p><p>As I said, it is worrying that there is also the issue of potential and actual exposure of pupils and teachers in school buildings of a certain vintage where maintenance has not been done to the standards that we might hope for. The issue will not go away and the numbers affected are rising; my colleague Stuart McMillan will pick up on that issue.</p><p>Meanwhile, the national health service is left to pick up the medical costs that, by rights, should be covered by the employing companies and their insurers. Therefore, I support fully Clydeside Action on Asbestos&#8217;s considered proposals for the recovery of the treatment costs to the NHS and for compensation to be consistent with the damage suffered by victims and their families.</p><p>We owe a very great deal to those people who, over the years, worked long and hard in very difficult industries. We also owe their families, who were often exposed to the asbestos dust that was brought home on people&#8217;s boiler suits, which were then washed at home; that exposed wives, partners and children to the dust. It is incredibly important that we do not forget, under any circumstances, the duty that we owe to people who have suffered, whether from pleural plaques, asbestosis or mesothelioma. Everyone who has suffered from the outrage of being exposed to asbestos and has not been properly recompensed deserves our support. The NHS, which finds itself having to care for people in those circumstances, should not be left unsupported financially by those who should have given a greater duty of care to their workers.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Asbestos-related Conditions (Healthcare Costs Recovery)"}, {"date": "2014-04-03", "body": "<p></p><p>10.

I could speak on it for half an hour, but members will be delighted to learn that I will not do so and that I will try to stick to my seven minutes.</p><p>I welcome to the chamber the Rev Neil Galbraith, founder of Glasgow the Caring City. Many members will know him. He has been tireless in his work both in the city of Glasgow and further afield. He is the minister of Cathcart old parish church; he is a police chaplain; and he also works with veterans, particularly in his coming home project, which he runs from his church. The project, which was discussed with the minister, Keith Brown, before it began, is for veterans who find it difficult to reintegrate into society. It gives them somewhere to go and meet their peers, and it is becoming a place where they can move on, get jobs and move back into society. It is fairly invaluable; in fact, I was speaking to a couple of people involved in it the other day.</p><p>For many, however, the Rev Neil Galbraith will be known as the founder of Glasgow the Caring City, the charity that I am delighted the Parliament is recognising today. It was founded in May 1999 as Glasgow&#8217;s very own aid agency. It was originally set up to help those who had been made homeless by the wars that were raging across the Balkans, and its aim was to help as many as possible of the thousands of asylum seekers and refugees who were arriving in Glasgow at that time. At its core, the charity&#8217;s central aim is to provide care, help and love to the most fragile and destitute children at home and abroad. It has worked tirelessly towards that aim for the past 15 years.</p><p>Glasgow the Caring City works with a number of projects around the world to provide help and support, locally and internationally. It also provides emergency relief where it can.</p><p>The charity&#8217;s first theme is education, which is a key part of its development strategy. As the late, great Nelson Mandela said,</p><p>&#8220;Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.&#8221;</p><p>The Caring City has taken that mantra to heart.</p><p>At home, the organisation has worked on its give a kid a goal project for the past couple of years. That started as a way to encourage primary 6 and 7 pupils to think in a different way about the issues that are closest to them and has grown into a much bigger project. It gets kids involved in their communities: they can organise or take part in a community event, take part in a youth organisation, find out a wee bit more about people&#8217;s history or get involved in a local campaign. It helps to foster links between children worldwide: children can, for example, support the work of an international charity, gather resources that are to be sent or take the time to learn about what life is like for children in different parts of the world.</p><p>The Caring City is clear that it wants to work towards its projects becoming self-sufficient. It provides help and expertise on education as the initial set-up, but the endgame is to empower communities around the world to decide what is best for their school or college. It has been fantastic to see the charity&#8217;s vision in action when I have visited the many projects that it has been involved in. I have been fortunate to travel abroad to see some of the great work that it has done in Uganda and South Sudan, which I will talk about in a moment.</p><p>The charity does a lot of work on disaster relief in relation to its key themes. In education, that means assisting and rebuilding schools that have been destroyed by natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes. That was clear from its support for the people of Cit&#233; Soleil in Haiti, helping to rebuild a school after the devastating earthquake there in 2010.</p><p>Another theme of the charity&#8217;s work is security. I believe that Glasgow the Caring City is one of the best examples of a charity that sees security not only as physical security from harm but as human security&#8212;the belief that being secure means more than just having police and an army but also comes from having easy access to food and water and having a secure job, home, relationships and family life.</p><p>Human security was at the heart of the Caring City&#8217;s work in post-tsunami Sri Lanka, where it invested in medium to long-term projects in the fishing and hospitality industries that became self-sustaining. That meant that the community could start to build a better future for itself out of the horrors of that fateful boxing day.</p><p>That approach is also apparent in the charity&#8217;s work in South Sudan at Matthew&#8217;s farm, which helps young men and women to become farmers and teaches them the skills that they need to farm the land; it also teaches them to read, write and do basic maths.</p><p>I have had the pleasure of visiting Matthew&#8217;s farm, which was funded by Ross Galbraith, the Caring City&#8217;s international development officer, to whom I give a special mention. He has seen the farm grow from being just a patch of land into a sustainable farm. The people who use it can now grow their goods, take them to the market, sell them and feed their families on the basis of what they get. That was not the case before. I have spoken to a number of people who have benefited from the farm, which is fantastic to see.</p><p>Closer to home, the organisation&#8217;s sofa-cycle initiative gives recycled furnishings and white goods to people across Glasgow who might need a helping hand to make their home life more secure.</p><p>Under the health banner, the Caring City has done great work around the beautiful game. When I was in Uganda, I watched a football match between local children who all wore Scotland strips that Scotland&#8217;s captain, Darren Fletcher, had donated. That is a great initiative and I hope that it will get continued support.</p><p>I have only scratched the surface of the many great projects that the Caring City has worked on and is working on. It is fair to say that its work has had a huge impact at home and around the world. I have been fortunate to see at first hand a lot of the work that it is doing in my constituency and in Glasgow, as well as further afield, as I said. The charity is a brilliant example of the sort of work that epitomises the Glasgow spirit. In a previous debate, I spoke about the brilliant celebration city festival during the Commonwealth games, which showed the city at its best.</p><p>It will come as no surprise to anybody in the chamber that I am proud of my constituency, where lots of great things are going on&#8212;I could bore members to death with all the examples. However, not many examples show my constituency, the city of Glasgow and the country of Scotland in a better light than Glasgow the Caring City. It has done great work over the past 15 years and I look forward to the work that it will do over the next 15 years.</p><p>I know that the minister has visited and has a close relationship with the charity, and I am sure that he will have kind words to say about it. I am delighted that the organisation is there for all the people whom it helps and that it is based in my constituency of Glasgow Cathcart.

We should all consider taking the opportunity to properly document the situation that we are in the midst of, not just for clarity for ourselves but for future generations.</p><p>Most of us will post a tweet about our canvassing results, put something on our Facebook page or our website, or send something to the local press to let our constituents know about what we have been doing or our thoughts on a particular matter, but the art of letter writing is, unfortunately, being lost and that is a real shame.</p><p>Anyone who has ever read the letters of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Abigail Adams or any of the others who were involved in the wars of independence in America will know of the pathos involved, of their hopes, fears and aspirations, and of the belief that they all displayed in their own country. I imagine that those themes will be seen in many of the letters that dearest Scotland collates over the course of the year.</p><p>One of the most famous letters to come out of pre-independent America was one that John Adams wrote to his wife Abigail on the eve of the declaration of independence. In it, he wrote:</p><p>&#8220;Time has been given for the whole people maturely to consider the great question of independence, and to ripen their judgment, dissipate their fears, and allure their hopes, by discussing it in newspapers and pamphlets, by debating it in assemblies, conventions, committees of safety and inspection, in town and county meetings, as well as in private conversations, so that the whole people, in every colony ... have now adopted it as their own act.&#8221;</p><p>That sounds pretty familiar to me, and I am sure that it will sound familiar to those who have campaigned over the past two years.</p><p>I am supportive of dearest Scotland because I think that, in this year perhaps above all others, all of us, regardless of our feelings about the referendum, should take the time to put down our dreams and aspirations for Scotland. When I read some of the letters that have been submitted, I was struck by the clear and consistent messages that come through, particularly in letters by people who are not originally from Scotland but who came here to study or to make their life here and settle down.</p><p>Those letters talk about what a beautiful country we are and how friendly our people are, but they also tell us that we need to look after ourselves more, mostly through altering our relationship with drugs, alcohol or food. They make it clear that we need to believe in ourselves more, that we do not always need to be the punchline in a joke, that we can be more than we are at the moment, and that we have everything that we need to succeed and be great. It is nice that visitors, however long they are here for&#8212;whether for the Commonwealth games, to study or for a slightly longer period&#8212;see so much more in us than sometimes we are able to see.</p><p>My aspirations for my dearest Scotland are simple. I want to live in a country that is fair and that does not continue to have its enviable resources squandered on its behalf.</p><p>In the previous debate, mention was made of the unfortunate tweet about food banks that said that the existence of food banks proved that Scotland was becoming a normal European country and that</p><p>&#8220;Far from being a sign of failure they are an enriching example of human compassion, faith and social cohesion.&#8221;</p><p>I want a Scotland that does not ever think of the existence of the need for food banks as being the normal state of affairs, and which acknowledges the charitable deeds of others while doing all that it can to ensure that people&#8212;and those whom I am talking about are often in work&#8212;do not need to rely on charity to feed themselves or their families.</p><p>I demand a Scotland where everyone gets paid a fair wage for a day&#8217;s work and one that is enough to ensure a decent standard of living. I want to live in a Scotland that believes in itself more, that continues to be pure dead brilliant and which keeps that gallus humour that we are renowned for the world over, but I also want us to start to look after ourselves better and to take the power to build a fairer, greener and equal society into our own hands.</p><p>I hope that, in a century, when people look back over the archives in the National Library of Scotland, which is on board with the initiative, they will see&#8212;regardless of the result of the referendum in just five weeks&#8212;that we have met the aspirations that we set for our dearest Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Dearest Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I had not initially intended to speak in this debate, but I feel that I should.</p><p>I had the privilege of speaking at a demonstration in Buchanan Street about four weeks ago at which the strength of feeling about this horrendous issue was overwhelming. What was very positive was that people who were not going to the demo but passing it and shopping in Buchanan Street were very sympathetic to what was going on at the demo.</p><p>I do not usually take part in demos&#8212;that is just not the sort of politician that I have been&#8212;but the sights that I had seen on social media in the week running up to it broke my heart and made me feel that I had to take part in that demo, which meant more than any almost any other one.</p><p>I take Ken Macintosh&#8217;s point about people feeling worried because of imbalance&#8212;I will come back to the issue of imbalance in a minute&#8212;but I do not know anybody in my circles or in this chamber who has said that this has got anything to do with people being Jewish. Nobody in this chamber has said that this has got anything to do with Israel&#8217;s right to self-defence. What it has got to do with is Israel&#8217;s completely indiscriminate and disproportionate attack on the people of Gaza.</p><p>Anybody who could look at the photos and films that we have seen would see children with half their heads missing and other horrendous sights&#8212;I saw when Patricia Ferguson was speaking that she was visibly upset about what she was having to talk about, and I think that that is how most of us feel. This debate is not an attack on any community; as a matter of fact, it is us trying to safeguard a particular community, which in this case is the people of Gaza.</p><p>There are wrongs taking place there. Nobody supports Hamas. I have not heard anybody come out and support Hamas, the rocket firing or the tunnels, as many other members have said in the debate. However, let us get things in proportion. Bombing schools and hospitals and targeting utilities is not the actions of a reasonable Government. Those are not the actions that Israel should be taking. If Israel is serious about wanting to live in peace with its neighbours, it is certainly going the wrong way about it. What I would ask Israel to do is lift the blockade.</p><p>In an earlier motion that I lodged, I asked the minister to look at how the Scottish Government could have an embargo on trading with the illegal settlements. They should not be there and we should not be encouraging them in any way. I think that an embargo could go some way towards sending a message that we here in Scotland support and stand by the people of Gaza and Palestine.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>I join Drew Smith in welcoming Kenny Stewart to the chamber. I have a feeling that Kenny, like many of us, has a Commonwealth games hangover and is here for a wee cure. It is nice to see him and I thank him for his help.</p><p>I am in the extremely lucky position of having Hampden Park on my doorstep, which meant that, for the duration of the games, it was buzzing outside my office in Mount Florida with people excited at the first-class sport that they were on their way to witness or had just witnessed in the arena.</p><p>No one who was there or who was watching on television will forget the travails of Eilidh Child, Hannah Miley, Ross Murdoch, Lynsey Sharp, Libby Clegg and so many others.</p><p>The games&#8217; sporting highlight was the incredible 13-year-old Erraid Davies whom I am sure Tavish Scott will want to speak about in more detail. Her smile after winning the bronze medal was, without a doubt, one of the great moments of the games.</p><p>For the 11 days of the games, the area that I represent, like so many others, was transformed not only by the sporting endeavours around it but by the countless local community groups that arranged numerous events to get into the Commonwealth games spirit.</p><p>On the Monday prior to the start of the games, I attended a lane party held by the Gateway Residents Association in Battlefield, which was attended by members of the Barbados Commonwealth team after the association had adopted that team as its Commonwealth games team. It was a great day, with a massive turnout from a local community keen to welcome the games to their area. I know that the event was appreciated by the Barbados team, as was their presence by the locals. I thank the athletes who came straight from their training that day to make sure that the games were seen to be a part of the community and not just the arenas</p><p>The local Clincarthill parish church hosted a coffee shop over the course of the games, which kept those involved extremely busy, and the visitors to the games well fed with the delicious selection of home baking on offer, and the parents, teachers and pupils of Mount Florida primary school did a magnificent job of decorating the triangle grassed area just outside their school and across the road from Hampden. I was driving past one day and I saw people putting knitted blankets around the trees. I had to stop to see whether anyone was vandalising the trees but it turned out to be the school pupils&#8217; way, along with their parents and their teachers, of welcoming people to the area.</p><p>The communities of Croftfoot and Castlemilk decorated the streets on the way to Cathkin Braes with banners and flags, and thousands turned out to watch the mountain biking at the purpose-built mountain biking centre. The local community is rallying round to ensure that one of the lasting legacies of the games is an increase in the facilities at the mountain biking track so that it can become an urban centre of mountain biking excellence.</p><p>Castlemilk also turned out in force to see the baton relay reach its community where it was carried for part of the way by Teresa Sadler, who was one of those nominated to carry the baton by members of her community, and who is another excellent example of a local champion in the area who is involved in a number of local groups and campaigns in the community over and above the fantastic work that she does as chair of Cassiltoun Housing Association.</p><p>The baton relay was just another example of the community spirit across the Commonwealth that the games fostered. The Queen&#8217;s baton travelled more than 198,000km across all parts of the Commonwealth and was warmly welcomed wherever it went.</p><p>Another of the local people who carried the baton on its journey to Celtic Park was Carol Paterson, who runs the magnificent Saturday club and Ozzy&#8217;s based at Cathcart old parish church. It will come as no surprise to the people in the chamber who know the Rev Neil Galbraith that his church was jam-packed with events as part of his celebration city festival. Glasgow the Caring City has worked in more than 55 of the 71 Commonwealth countries that had teams competing in the games.</p><p>I hosted one of those events, which was a night of Celtic rock with Eric Faulkner of Bay City Rollers fame, and an up-and-coming Glasgow band called the Chaplins&#8212;named after the comedian and not the Rev Neil&#8212;with lead singer Jill Jackson. It was a great evening with more than a few ladies of a certain age a bit excited to meet a Bay City Roller. It is amazing how quickly some can revert to their screaming teenager phase. That was just one of a number of events that took place but undoubtedly the highlight, outwith my night of course, was &#8220;Bravehearts the Musical&#8221;, starring the kids from the aforementioned Saturday club and Ozzy&#8217;s.</p><p>For those who do not know, the Saturday club and Ozzy&#8217;s are clubs for children who have disabilities of varying kinds, and to see them put in the effort and put on such a performance was extremely touching as well as entertaining. I also have to give a message to all those dedicated ladies&#8212;and they were all ladies, which is why I say it&#8212;who worked so hard to make sure that the tea rooms were open for everybody who attended during the 11 days.</p><p>That is just a small flavour of the more than 120 events that were put on over the course of the celebration city festival. The whole area was a cacophony of sights and sounds and it is clear that there is a want for the games to leave a lasting legacy.</p><p>We are here to talk of legacy and for me it will come in many different guises. As a board member of Scottish Women in Sport, I was particularly delighted to see that Scottish women had their best games ever. We need to keep that momentum going and do all we can to ensure that a lasting legacy of the games is getting more women of all ages involved and engaged in sport.</p><p>I suspect that the greatest legacy for my great city will be the reawakening of community spirit that took place before and during the games. We talk about part of the legacy being about humanity and I have seen no greater examples of humanity than I saw during the two weeks of the Commonwealth games, when people from all over the world worked together, enjoyed each other&#8217;s company and made sure that the games were the friendly games.

It is great that the games will bring a lasting legacy not just to Glasgow but to Scotland as a whole, but a number of local organisations are working to deliver a legacy outwith Scotland. One of those is Cathcart old parish church in my constituency, which is involved in the hit the net programme, to help protect children from malaria. The church has used the Commonwealth games particularly well to raise funds for that programme. What impact does the cabinet secretary expect the Glasgow games legacy to have on the rest of the Commonwealth?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games 2014"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>Thank you, Presiding Officer&#8212;I think.</p><p>First of all, I support the motion in the convener&#8217;s name and thank my fellow committee members and those who have taken part in this afternoon&#8217;s debate.</p><p>As has been mentioned, this has been a lengthy process. To reach this point has taken more than a year, and we have held fourteen meetings, including six oral evidence sessions. I do not intend to rehearse everything that happened at the preliminary stage&#8212;we have had that debate, and the convener referred to it in her speech&#8212;but I note that, following a substantial amount of written evidence and having heard oral evidence from the promoter, supporters and objectors, the committee recommended that the general principles of the bill be agreed to and that it should proceed as a private bill, which Parliament subsequently agreed.</p><p>That took us to the consideration stage. With 59 objections outstanding, the committee considered long and hard what would be the best approach to scrutiny. The convener has already outlined our approach to grouping objections, but it might be worth noting that, given that the same or similar issues were being raised in the majority of objections, the committee could have divided objections into just two or perhaps three groups. We consciously avoided that, in the reasonable expectation that objectors who are living in different parts of the area around the park might envisage different degrees of adverse effect&#8212;for example, in respect of loss of amenity or concerns about traffic. In order to maximise the opportunity for evidence, we agreed to have six groups to ensure that all objectors had an increased opportunity to have their say. To further facilitate evidence from objectors, we accommodated requests from objector groups to reschedule their proposed evidence sessions.</p><p>Objections covered a range of issues from loss of amenity to traffic and road safety issues and visual impact. I will touch briefly on some of those points in the time that is available, but I note at this point that having considered all the written and oral evidence that was presented to us by the objectors, and all the responses and commitments that were received from the promoter in relation to compensatory and mitigation measures, the committee reached the view that the adverse effects on the private interests of individuals&#8212;that is, the objectors&#8212;were outweighed by the benefits that enactment of the bill and subsequent construction of the new school would bring to the local community.</p><p>As other members have pointed out, another concern that was presented by the objectors was that the bill would create a precedent for other local authorities to follow suit by trying to introduce bills that would have an impact on common good land in their areas. That point has been considered throughout the process, and we remain of the view that the bill does not create a precedent because it relates solely to a particular area of land in a particular part of a particular city in Scotland. Any bills covering common good land elsewhere would, of course, require to be considered on their own merits and circumstances.</p><p>The convener has referred to the compensatory measure of the creation of an area of replacement open space at the site of the current school; I note, as was discussed earlier, that Alison Johnstone lodged an amendment whose effect would have been to bind the City of Edinburgh Council to provide such replacement open space by including the provision in the bill. I echo the convener&#8217;s point that the committee was keen to ensure that the council provided such space, and we are satisfied with the promoter&#8217;s commitment in that respect. For example, we note the full council&#8217;s commitment, in 2012, to make provision for replacement parkland or green space to be used for social and recreational purposes, and that those purposes will be safeguarded by Fields in Trust. Moreover, in March 2013, the council agreed to refer the question of the most appropriate use of that new open space, within the parameters of social and recreational purposes, to a local neighbourhood partnership for consultation.</p><p>In written evidence to the committee on 26 March, it was stated:</p><p>&#8220;The promoter&#8217;s letter &#8230; of 31 January 2014 &#8230; confirmed the commitment to securing the area of replacement open space, offered to provide a further express undertaking to the Committee to that effect, and summarised the &#8230; intention to secure Fields in Trust ... On 6 February 2014, the Council&#8217;s elected members unanimously approved giving Fields in Trust a written undertaking to the effect that both the replacement open space and the remaining area of open space on the Park will &#8230; be dedicated as Fields in Trust&#8221;.</p><p>I will provide a flavour of some of the objectors&#8217; concerns. As I have mentioned, a number of the groups had predominantly the same or similar concerns, including loss of amenity and visual and environmental impacts, but as the convener said, when objectors were invited by the promoter to put forward any ideas that might mitigate their concerns in those areas, they argued only that the school should be built elsewhere.</p><p>The vast majority of objectors argued that they would lose a significant amenity and that it would impact on a variety of recreational activities were the park to be appropriated for the council&#8217;s education functions. They supported the argument by suggesting that the loss of green space would have a negative impact on their health and wellbeing.</p><p>The committee acknowledged that loss of the park would represent a loss of green space, and acknowledged the general health benefits that are to be derived from such spaces. However, we noted that there are other parkland areas in Portobello. We also recognised&#8212;as we had at the preliminary stage&#8212;that should the park be built on, replacement open space compensatory measures were planned. We were content that issues of loss of amenity did not outweigh the benefits to the community of a new school&#8217;s being built on the park&#8212;in particular when considering that the local community would, where appropriate, have access to the sports and leisure facilities that it is proposed will go with the school. Objectors expressed concerns about the visual impact of the development, including the loss of views, the height of the building and the fencing. [Interruption.]</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill: Final Stage"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>Thank you very much, Presiding Officer.</p><p>In response, the promoter argued that the visual impact had been taken into account as part of the planning process with, for example, the building being designed to retain views of Arthur&#8217;s Seat and the majority of fences being low and integrated within boundary planning. It was confirmed that the new football pitches would be floodlit and that the lighting was designed not to spill out to neighbouring houses, and that planning consent was subject to the hours of use of the pitches being restricted.</p><p>Objectors maintained that development of the park would lead to a loss of wildlife and the removal of trees, which would cause a loss of habitat for birds and wildlife. The committee acknowledged those and other environmental impacts that would result from the development, but was satisfied with the promoter&#8217;s references to compensation measures, which included additional planting and a condition to the planning permission requiring a detailed landscape and habitat management plan.</p><p>Objectors who do not live in the immediate vicinity of Portobello park, or who do not live in Edinburgh at all, were included in one group. Their concerns related primarily to issues that had been covered at the preliminary stage: for example, the role of the Parliament in legislating subsequent to a Court of Session ruling, the precedent argument, and alternative sites. However, they also had some concerns about loss of amenity. The committee took the view that although those objectors might experience some loss of amenity, it was clearly not at the same level as that which would potentially be experienced by objectors in the immediate area of the park.</p><p>Portobello golf course golfers objected as a special interest group. They principally had two concerns: health and safety and future use of the golf course. On health and safety, the objectors were concerned that there would be risks to school pupils taking short cuts across the golf course. Evidence that was presented by the promoter suggested that there would be mitigation measures to counter those concerns, including appropriate fencing being put in place. On the future of the golf course, the objectors feared that a case might be made for development on the site. The promoter referred to previous assurances that there were no such plans. The committee was satisfied that the golf course did not form part of the area to which the bill applies and that mitigation measures had been proposed to protect the users of both the course and the school.</p><p>The committee was satisfied that, although the bill does not authorise the construction of a new high school in Portobello park, the removal of the legal obstacle that is currently preventing it will allow the development to go ahead. The committee, having considered the evidence that was presented to it, including the mitigation measures and commitments that were provided by the promoter, concluded that the benefits that will result from the bill&#8217;s being enacted and the construction of the new school on the park will outweigh any adverse effects on the private interests of objectors.</p><p>I pass on my sincere thanks to Siobhan McMahon for her role as committee convener. She fulfilled the role particularly diligently. Her handling of all the evidence was impressive; she demonstrated patience and flexibility in managing the oral evidence sessions, giving witnesses ample opportunity to contribute, and she dealt with a significant volume of written evidence and separate correspondence, much of which was unpleasant, to say the least.</p><p>I support the motion.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill: Final Stage"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>I congratulate Bob Doris on bringing the debate to the chamber.

The way in which it has been conducted has meant that it has served as a great showcase for the whole world of exactly what Scotland has to offer.</p><p>My goodness&#8212;when we listen to what everyone has said, we see that we have a fantastic country.

It attracts thousands of visitors and involves local community groups. This year, the restored Kelvingrove bandstand opened. It lay derelict for many years, but it has been brought back to life. It is much loved and was much used during the festival and the Commonwealth games. I thank everyone, including voluntary groups, who was involved in restoring the bandstand.</p><p>The west end festival is run on a pretty tight budget&#8212;members have spoken about budgets. I thank the many people who put their heart and soul into it so that we can enjoy it year after year. It will have its 20th birthday next year. I do not like to be a wee bit cheeky, but I am looking at the cab sec; I am not saying that we should get money from the Government, but I am sure that Michael Dale and others would be pleased to speak to the cab sec about some way to get a wee bit more funding for the festival.</p><p>Hanzala Malik mentioned the mela, which is another fantastic event. It is held in Kelvingrove park during the merchant city festival and it celebrates all the diverse cultures not only in Glasgow but throughout Scotland. It is fantastic that the mela mixes the traditional with the modern, so all age groups go along and thoroughly enjoy it. Hanzala was right that, unfortunately, it rained pretty badly this year, but we still went and thoroughly enjoyed the mela.</p><p>When I intervened on Rhoda Grant, I mentioned the merchant city festival, which is a fantastic success.

The festival is a success every year, but it proved an even bigger success this year. As the cab sec said, Glasgow was buzzing&#8212;it certainly was, and no more so than in the merchant city. We had food zones with fantastic food from around the world, we had stages with live groups, we had acrobats and we had a marvellous maze for young kids&#8212;perhaps I am a young kid at heart, because I thought that it was really good. The sunshine was wonderful, as were the people&#8212;not just the Glaswegians but the people from throughout the country and the world who came along in their droves to enjoy the festival. It will go from strength to strength next year.</p><p>There is merit in Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s idea of a festival of sport, particularly for younger people. That would fall within Shona Robison&#8217;s sport portfolio rather than the cab sec&#8217;s. We talk about the legacy of the Commonwealth games, and perhaps that suggestion would be a good way of exploring exactly what legacy has been left and continuing the success of the games. I would be happy to be involved in that.</p><p>In opening, I said that we in Scotland have something to celebrate, which we certainly do. The debate has been great and I have loved it. I would love to take a couple of months off to travel round the country from the Shetlands to Dumfries, given what Elaine said. Fantastic work goes on across Scotland. The debate shows that, although even we do not know all that goes on in our country, plenty of people throughout the world know, and more will know this year because of the promotion that Scotland has had.</p><p>This is a great place to live and a great place to be. I look forward to more success for not just local festivals but those with an international flavour.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I declare an interest as a member of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on Palestine, and I have visited Gaza and the west bank.</p><p>I thank Drew Smith for securing the debate and pay tribute to the millions of people throughout the world&#8212;many of them Jewish, by the way&#8212;who have marched in support of the people of Gaza and against the killing of innocent civilians by Israel. As Patricia Ferguson said, the death toll among Palestinians from operation protective edge is 1,948 and is rising daily. Most of them are civilians. We face a huge humanitarian crisis, with areas completely destroyed and homes uninhabitable. In fact, the UN has said that the destruction is &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; and is like nothing the UN has ever seen before.</p><p>Schools, hospitals and UN shelters have all been destroyed. There is no power or water and raw sewage is flowing in the streets, all because of the indiscriminate attack by the Israelis. The suffering of the Palestinian people must stop. The people of Gaza have been left with nothing. I saw a quote from a gentleman who had lost his wife and who was left with just the clothes that he stood in, but he said, &#8220;Thanks to Allah, I have my six children.&#8221; People have nothing left apart from their pride and their great resilience. I really admire them for that resilience.</p><p>However, admiration is not enough&#8212;action is needed. The Disasters Emergency Committee has launched an appeal and a fund, which is most welcome. I thank the Scottish Government for its actions on medical aid and its call for an arms embargo on Israel. That is the action that I want to see, but I want to raise another issue with the minister. I ask him to consider whether the Scottish Government can do more under the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. Under the statutory guidance, which is being considered, could the procurement process allow bodies to take into account whether products, services or businesses come from land that is internationally recognised as illegally occupied, as determined by resolution 446 of the UN Security Council?</p><p>Much has been said and will be said about the situation in Gaza. Drew Smith is absolutely right: this is the third horrific attack on the Gazans and the Palestinian people. Gaza is a prison camp. The people of Gaza deserve our support and the people of Palestine deserve their state.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>Will the member take an intervention?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>I am looking forward to an animated debate. I start by giving a big, warm thank you to everyone who took part in the games, from the athletes to the volunteers, the transport workers, the council workers and of course the people of Glasgow and of Scotland, who truly made them the people&#8217;s games. I heard throughout the games that they were indeed the people&#8217;s games. I believe that they have given that legacy to the rest of the world.</p><p>The games are still resonating throughout Glasgow, and I think that we are a bit shell-shocked that they are not still going on. Some people are happy that they can now go on the bus or get their car out, but the vast majority of people are saying, &#8220;What&#8217;s happened? It was so busy.&#8221; We are now looking forward to anything else that comes to Glasgow.</p><p>As a member of the executive committee of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in the Scottish Parliament, I am proud that the organisers of the games took the initiative to raise money through UNICEF for the benefit of the children of the Commonwealth. I am glad that Patricia Ferguson mentions that in her motion. It was a truly unique idea, and it showed the spirit and humanity of Glasgow and the people of Scotland.</p><p>I echo Lord Smith of Kelvin, chair of Glasgow 2014, who said:</p><p>&#8220;Glasgow&#8217;s connections with the Commonwealth are centuries old and they run deep. They tell a story of industry and enterprise on a global scale. These connections have been strengthened. And whilst the Games may leave Glasgow, Glasgow will never forget the Commonwealth Games. It has made its mark on our city. It has won a place in our hearts.</p><p>This is a city that dares to dream. A city defined by its people. A city which looks out for each other. A welcoming city&#8221;.</p><p>That is very true, and I will come back to some of the personal experiences that I had during the games. We will continue our connections with the Commonwealth after 18 September.</p><p>I am also proud of the minister&#8217;s announcement&#8212;I thank her for it&#8212;about the para-sports centre to be based in Largs, which will be the first in the UK. That is great news and it fits in with the legacy of humanity, equality and destiny.</p><p>I congratulate the City of Glasgow College, which had six graduates in team Scotland, including Kimberley Renicks, who won the first gold medal of the games, and Liam Davie, whose team claimed the first medal for team gymnastics. That surely bodes well for our colleges and what they can achieve, and also for the future of our gymnasts and athletes in our colleges. We must remember that.</p><p>I want to share some of my fantastic personal experiences of the games, starting with the transport workers. Obviously, we were still working during the games and, living in the Merchant City, I could not get the car out, so I would walk or jump on the bus.</p><p>I must admit that everyone was so happy. We had to stand going to the city centre and coming out from the city centre, but it was an absolutely happy atmosphere. The drivers on the First bus really took the games to their hearts. They would get off the bus to take people off with prams or wheelchairs. I was saying earlier to the cabinet secretary that one particular driver&#8212;I am sure that he will know who he is if he reads this&#8212;was so enthusiastic. When people got on from Kelvingrove with their passes saying that they were going to the wrestling or the judo&#8212;and they were over 50 years of age, put it that way&#8212;the driver would remark, &#8220;Surely to goodness you&#8217;re not going to go wrestling or anything,&#8221; and everybody took it in absolutely fantastic spirit. That was the way it was throughout the games.</p><p>I also thank the Glasgow City Council workers who kept the city absolutely spotlessly clean. They worked 24 hours a day; they worked constantly. It was great to see them come out in the closing ceremony as Deacon Blue was singing &#8220;Dignity&#8221;. I thought that was a really nice touch, because they had worked so hard. Living in the Merchant City and travelling throughout Glasgow Kelvin&#8212;there were lots of things going on in my constituency&#8212;I know that the city was spotlessly clean; the workers kept the whole thing going.</p><p>There are so many people to mention, including the volunteers and the police. I saw a couple of policemen joining in and doing a dance in Argyle Street&#8212;we had a 1920s and 1940s event one afternoon&#8212;and they were having a great time. I am sure that everyone else probably saw it&#8212;it was on YouTube. I thought the police did a great job.</p><p>The everyday people in Glasgow were absolutely fantastic. They helped people; they gave them directions&#8212;even if they did not want to go. In Glasgow we are pretty famous for telling people, &#8220;If you want to go there, we&#8217;ll take you. You maybe don&#8217;t want to go for another hour, but we&#8217;ll take you just now anyway.&#8221; They gave people a history of Glasgow. I was with a couple of Australians up at the necropolis and people were giving them a history of the necropolis.</p><p>The great thing was that every single one of the visitors said that they had never visited Glasgow or other parts of Scotland&#8212;perhaps they had visited the Highlands but not a city centre&#8212;and they were definitely going to come back. There was so much going on and people were so enthused that they wanted to come back.</p><p>We have to thank the staff who ran the hotels, the pubs, the clubs and the restaurants. They ran those places absolutely fantastically. I hope that they got the salaries that they deserved, because they worked very hard, round the clock, with a smile on their face. All in all, the legacy that has been left to the rest of the Scotland and the world is that Glasgow is a great place and people are always welcome to come and visit.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p></p><p>2.

I repeat the plea that I and many others have made to the minister before for the Home Office to give MSPs the right to stand up for and serve our constituents&#8212;that is what the people involved are. The Home Office continually denies us that right.</p><p>Like others, I have stood outside Dungavel and attended rallies. I have visited people who have been held in Dungavel and I have even had my fingerprints taken there, although I have not had them back yet. That is what goes on when a visit is made to anyone in Dungavel. I visited a family and gave a child a chocolate biscuit, but the biscuit was taken off the child because of its wrapper. Drinks and other items cannot be given, either. Dungavel is a detention camp. I have always called it that and I still call it that. It is a detention camp in Scotland, but it is outwith our control.</p><p>Some truly shocking stories have come out of Dungavel.

That is what it seems like to me and many others. I am not sure, but to say that the system is working is untrue.</p><p>We know that the Home Office is not fit for purpose and that refugees and asylum seekers are treated badly while being used as scapegoats for any of society&#8217;s ills.

We should recognise the ways in which our lives and culture are strengthened by the contribution of visiting artists and performers and celebrate the cross-fertilisation that keeps our culture dynamic and inspiring. We must also acknowledge the impact that our festivals have on the economy, particularly their contribution to our tourism and hospitality industries.</p><p>I was reminded when thinking about this debate that we do not ask much of our artists and performers and those who work in the creative industries at festival time. After all, we only ask that they be the best they can be in their chosen field or practice and that they perform, day after day and night after night, to audiences large and small in a diverse range of venues&#8212;I use the word &#8220;diverse&#8221;, because it is the politest way to describe some of the venues that I have visited in festivals over the years.</p><p>Year after year our artists and performers deliver and they come back, because they know that Edinburgh in August is the place to be. It is where opportunities arise&#8212;sometimes unexpectedly&#8212;and where those people will be received by knowledgeable audiences who, more often than not, are on their side and willing them to succeed.</p><p>For established artists it is a showcase and for new artists it is a place to serve an apprenticeship&#8212;or perhaps undergo a baptism of fire. For the audience it is a chance to spot the next big thing; to spend an afternoon listening to clever, witty and challenging people discussing a variety of literary genres at the book festival; and in the evening perhaps to watch stand-up at the fringe or opera at the international festival.</p><p>On the walk from Waverley station every day I am mesmerised by the number of adverts for performances that are attached to the railings on Jeffrey Street, and I am often distracted as I look at them and think of the scale of what is happening in this city at this time.</p><p>We talk about the Edinburgh festival particularly to describe the events that take place in August, but of course Edinburgh&#8217;s festivals are spread throughout the year, with the hogmanay events in January, the science festival in April, the Imaginate festival in May, the film and jazz festivals in June and July and the storytelling festival in October&#8212;to name but a few.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary said, there are 12 festivals in total, which between them host 25,000 international artists, more than 1,000 accredited media representatives and audiences of more than 4 million people. Those numbers are quite staggering, so I make no apologies for repeating them. The festivals&#8217; effect on the Scottish economy is staggering, too, generating some &#163;261 million. Bed occupancy in Edinburgh&#8217;s hotels reaches 93 per cent in August and &#163;37 million is spent in cafes and bars alone. That truly is part of the energy and dynamism of this city. Many of those who come to Edinburgh then journey on to other parts of Scotland and the United Kingdom.</p><p>In 2006 the &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; report was published, which identified many of those important figures and suggested that more could be done. One of its main recommendations was that the individual festivals needed to work more collaboratively and to have better relationships with other agencies.</p><p>In early 2007 I had the privilege of chairing the first meeting of the festivals forum, which went on to become Festivals Edinburgh, which enables strategic planning and decision making to be undertaken. I am delighted that it is now planning a further &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; report, which I think will help set out the direction of travel for the next 10 years and beyond and will help Edinburgh to retain its jealously guarded pre-eminence in the field. My colleague Sarah Boyack will say more about that in her contribution.</p><p>Before I move on from the Edinburgh festivals, I think that it is right, as Scottish Labour&#8217;s amendment suggests, to mark the departure of Sir Jonathan Mills as director of the Edinburgh international festival. Jonathan Mills came to Edinburgh from Australia with an established reputation as an artist of renown in his own right but also someone who brought his fierce intelligence and love of the arts to the role of artistic director of the Melbourne international arts festival. Over the past seven years, he has stamped his mark on the international festival here, too, and he will be missed&#8212;thankfully he is not leaving us entirely, as I think that he plans to stay in Edinburgh&#8212;but he is leaving the festival in good heart and, importantly, in good finance, which his successor, Fergus Linehan, will no doubt be grateful for. Sir Jonathan tells us that while he is in Edinburgh he plans to finish an opera that he is writing, and I am sure that we all wish him well in that endeavour.</p><p>As the motion identifies, it is not only in Edinburgh that we find artistic and other festivals and the efforts of EventScotland to promote, encourage and help to fund many of the events is welcome. I think that we are lucky to have organisations as professional and highly regarded as VisitScotland and EventScotland working with local authorities and organisers to make Scotland a year-round destination for those with a love of and an interest in the arts. From Edinburgh&#8217;s hogmanay to Celtic Connections in Glasgow, T in the Park, the Wickerman festival and Hebtember&#8212;which I must admit was a new one on me&#8212;the calendar of events is packed.</p><p>The fact that the Commonwealth games incorporates an arts festival is one of the things that I think makes it so special. In its original iteration, the Olympic games also had a cultural festival&#8212;indeed, there was a time when medals were awarded for artistic endeavour, too. The fact that the effort has continued to this day with the Commonwealth games is one of the things that it them so special.</p><p>Because I was a Clyde-sider, I did not have as much opportunity during the games as I would have liked to experience what was happening in Glasgow, let alone around the rest of the country, but what I did see was remarkable. It is always invidious to compare these things, but, if I may say so, I attended a lot of cultural events in Melbourne in 2006 and I think that we did it a bit better.</p><p>From the work done by Depot Arts in my constituency on the day that the baton came through Possilpark, to the live zone at Glasgow Green or the performance of our friend and colleague Pauline McNeill with the band Mc4 in the merchant city, there was some wonderful work going on. Of course around Scotland there were exhibitions such as &#8220;Generation&#8221; featuring people such as Alison Watt and Toby Paterson. All of it was interesting and challenging&#8212;and free.</p><p>We saw Glasgow and its people at their best during the Commonwealth games. Indeed, somehow the entire country felt more invigorated and joyful than usual. If Edinburgh can host an arts festival every year, could Glasgow host a festival of sport on an annual basis? Before my colleagues and indeed the cabinet secretary get too worried about that, I stress that I am not talking about anything on the scale of the Commonwealth games, and I am not necessarily talking about an event for our elite athletes&#8212;and, yes, I do realise that the sporting calendar is already cluttered. Could we host an annual event for young athletes, very amateur athletes or indeed for veteran athletes? Perhaps it would not work, but it just seems to me that we need to find a way to capture that enthusiasm and spirit. Perhaps a festival of sport would be an option and, indeed, a fitting legacy of the sport and the culture that we enjoyed so much in 2014.</p><p>There are so many festivals around the country that it is always invidious to mention some without mentioning others. I am sure that my colleagues will mention those that they are particularly aware of in their local areas. One thing that they all have in common is that they would not happen if it were not for the imagination and ingenuity of people who care about what happens in their communities, who care what happens to art and culture in our country and who are determined to make a difference, and to make sure that they, along with their local communities, friends and neighbours, can enjoy the very best of what Scotland has to offer, wherever it happens to be.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-10784.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;; congratulates EventScotland on the contribution that it made to Scotland&#8217;s thriving festivals scene; considers that the initiative of Festivals Edinburgh in commissioning a further edition of the report, Thundering Hooves, will be an important and helpful contribution to the continuing development of the Edinburgh festivals; congratulates Sir Jonathan Mills on his major contribution to the Edinburgh International Festival and to the cultural life of Scotland as he prepares to hand over to Fergus Linehan, and wishes both men well for the future&#8221;.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>This has been an interesting debate and it has been worth our while to hear colleagues talk about what interests them and what is happening in their local areas.</p><p>I add my thanks to all the staff of Glasgow Life and Glasgow City Council who worked so hard to make festival 2014 such a success. I also thank all the volunteers who participated in the games opening and closing ceremonies. At one point, I calculated that some of the dancers performed constantly for two hours in very bright sunshine, wearing what looked to me like very heavy costumes and brandishing chairs for some of the event. Our thanks go to them, too.</p><p>My one regret about 2014 is that the calendar has been so cluttered&#8212;not to mention the fact that we have another interesting event coming up in only a few weeks&#8212;which has made it difficult to get to as many things as I would have liked to attend. However, I suppose that it is not a bad thing to have an embarrassment of riches.</p><p>Liz Smith brought a welcome historical perspective to our festival offering. I am glad that she made the connection with the built heritage, because I agree that culture and our built heritage help us to have a sense of ourselves and a sense of the place that we inhabit. That must be a good thing, and must be what we come back to and root ourselves in time after time.</p><p>I agree with Clare Adamson that this year has been exciting, but I think that Scotland is exciting every year. I am sure that she would agree with me.</p><p>One of the events that I was not able to get to was the performance of the choir at lunchtime today. I very much regret that. However, I happened to have the door of my office open and, although I was on the other side of the building, I heard every note. It sounded stunning, but that just made me regret all the more the fact that I was not there to hear it.</p><p>Nigel Don hit on something important when he talked about the experience of live performance. There is something remarkable about sharing a live performance; I think it is something that we all enjoy whether or not we are consciously enjoying it. Perhaps sharing it is just one of the things that adds to the experience. I am not sure, but I think that it is an important aspect.</p><p>My colleague, Sarah Boyack, was absolutely right to remind of us of the international outlook of the Edinburgh international festival. That may sound a bit like an oxymoron, but I think that members know what I mean. It is that outlook that makes the Edinburgh festivals so exciting.</p><p>Demands for additional venues and on the budgets of the City of Edinburgh Council and the Scottish Government are made, of course. In a sense, that is no bad thing because it means that the people who are involved are constantly striving to do better and to do more.</p><p>A parliamentary debate about a tourism levy is an interesting idea. There are arguments on both sides of that dilemma, but the time has come for us to give the idea a proper hearing.</p><p>It must be a challenge for Edinburgh to support all that is happening and, at the same time, to have that ambition&#8212;that we all share&#8212;to see the festivals develop and become bigger and even better still. That is an important aspect of the &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; review that will happen shortly.</p><p>I was very struck by what Colin Keir said about free advertising for the city of Edinburgh; he was absolutely right. He reminded me of something that struck me last night when I was watching the BBC news coverage of Mark Carney&#8217;s conversations from yesterday. The national news piece, which was filmed on Calton hill, showed the most stunning views of Edinburgh. To be honest, I am quite sure that most people were not listening to what was being said about Mark Carney; rather, they were enjoying the Edinburgh view because it is probably one that most visitors to the city do not see.</p><p>Colin Keir was also right to talk about the important contributions that have been made by Faith Liddell, Kath Mainland and Jonathan Mills. To that list I add Councillor Steve Cardownie and Councillor Lesley Hinds who, as a former chair of the Edinburgh festivals, had a keen appreciation of, and interest in, the festivals.</p><p>I was sorry to hear about this year&#8217;s experience with RockNess in Rhoda Grant&#8217;s constituency. Perhaps we need to look at more constructive collaboration. I am very conscious that I attended a wonderful event in Wigtown&#8212;it was years ago&#8212;for which Glasgow City Council had loaned some of its Glasgow boys paintings. There was a hugely successful summer of exhibitions, talks and conversations about that. Perhaps we need to work more closely together across our country to make such events happen in a way that benefits all.</p><p>Rob Gibson rightly mentioned last night&#8217;s Commonwealth games celebration in Parliament. It was a joy to hear part of Jim Sutherland&#8217;s excellent piece, as was having it contrasted with the New Zealand group, Haka, performing some of its traditional music. It also reminded us that we have a shared interest in music and dance, too, that brings us together and helps us to understand our place.</p><p>I was very pleased that Nanette Milne mentioned the Aberdeen international youth music festival. I congratulate her on taking the opportunity to lobby Nigel Don for funding from the two local authorities in his area. I am sure that that is a constructive partnership that can be developed.</p><p>In reflecting on Stewart Stevenson&#8217;s concern about the demise of the mouth harp, I wonder whether that might have something to do with our new concern about our teeth. As a very inexperienced player many years ago when I was a child, I found that playing the mouth harp interfered with good dental work. That might be part of the problem; I do not know.</p><p>Hanzala Malik was right to draw our attention to the Glasgow mela. It is a stunning event&#8212;it is the most enjoyable, diverse, bright and colourful event that a person can attend. Edinburgh and other places in Scotland also host melas. If anyone has not been to a mela, they should go because it is an experience to enjoy and savour.</p><p>I mentioned that Nigel Don had hit on something when he talked about how special live performance is when shared with others. I also reflected on his comments about the paper and comb festival, which led me to wonder whether he and Stewart Stevenson might want to join together to form a two-person combo playing the mouth harp and the paper and comb. I am not suggesting that I would necessarily buy a ticket to watch them, but it might be something that they would like to do.</p><p>The idea of holding a tea festival in Laurencekirk is intriguing. As Nigel Don said, that not only shows the ingenuity of Scots, but demonstrates that we do not need a lot of encouragement to find something to celebrate and to enjoy with others.</p><p>I hope that members will forgive me for recounting a personal anecdote. Elaine Murray&#8217;s explanation of the burlesque Burns supper in Dumfries reminded me that, a number of years ago, I was asked by a wonderful man with a particular sense of humour, who came from Glasgow&#8212;he is now deceased&#8212;but lived in Dumfries for many years, whether I would organise a Labour Party Burns supper in that area. I did so, and it was a huge success. However, Elaine Murray&#8217;s comments caused me to reflect on what Iain Jordan&#8217;s comments about a burlesque Burns supper might have been. I am sure that they would have been unparliamentary in language and probably unprintable.</p><p>Sandra White was right to reflect on the west end festival&#8217;s approaching its 20th anniversary. Why not lobby the Government for some money for that event? I say that with a slight vested interest, as it touches on my constituency.</p><p>The debate has been interesting and shows that there is a real commitment to art and culture across the chamber and in Scotland. It also reminds us of the endeavour that our festivals help us to celebrate. I look forward to hearing more about &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; part 2 and to considering what the Government and the Parliament can do to help and support those festivals.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the humanitarian disaster that is the unfolding tragedy in Gaza. I am sure that members across the chamber will join me in thanking our colleague Drew Smith for securing the chance for Parliament to debate this most serious and deadly conflict.</p><p>According to Amnesty International, since the Israeli military offensive started on 8 July, 1,948 Palestinians have been killed as a direct result of the offensive. The majority&#8212;over 85 per cent&#8212;were civilians, including 456 children. Three civilians have been killed by rockets or mortars that were fired from Gaza and 64 Israeli soldiers have been killed. Almost 12,000 homes in Gaza have been reduced to rubble. Those are the stark statistics of the bloody and unequal conflict that is being played out in Gaza, which has been graphically captured on our television screens.</p><p>Among the destruction that has rained down on the defenceless civilian population of Gaza, it is the fate of the children that is most heart-rending. I will cite the case of 10-year-old Mohamed Badran&#8212;one of the hundreds of innocents who have been affected. He was blinded in an Israeli air strike but, at the hospital, he seemed to be unaware that his entire family had been killed when a missile destroyed their home at the Nuseirat refugee camp. Unable to understand his injury, he repeatedly asked staff why they had switched off the lights.</p><p>That is just one little boy&#8217;s awful situation. He has been left blind and orphaned by an indiscriminate attack of the Israeli air force. That is one terrible consequence of a political decision by the present Government in Tel Aviv to wage war not against an opposing army but against a defenceless civilian population&#8212;not an act of war but a war crime.</p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, let me be crystal clear&#8212;I, along with, I am sure, colleagues across the chamber, hold all human life dear. We mourn for the dead, both Palestinian and Israeli. When we criticise the actions of Israel in Gaza, it is not a condemnation of Jews or Judaism; it is a condemnation of the present political establishment in Israel. Of course, the firing of rockets by Hamas must end, but Israel&#8217;s response goes far beyond defending its borders and population. The life of a Palestinian child is not worth less than the life of an Israeli child.</p><p>The situation is primarily the result of the political actions of the Israeli Government. We must do all that we can to bring pressure to bear on that Government to change the course of action that has had such catastrophic consequences for the civilian population of Gaza. There needs to be a negotiated ceasefire that is more permanent than the series of recent 72-hour ceasefires, and the immediate humanitarian effort in Gaza needs to have a real chance to deliver the much-needed emergency supplies of food, water and hygiene kits to those who are in such desperate need. Of course, we must not forget the aid agencies, whose workers risk life and limb to get supplies to the people who need them.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I shall do, Presiding Officer.</p><p>Pressure must be brought on the Israeli Government to change its long-term strategy as regards Gaza and the Palestinian people.

It is time for all of those who are involved to engage in proper dialogue and to bring to an end this on-going tragedy.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>I am delighted with the announcement that the cabinet secretary made about the facility in Largs. As she knows, I have had a keen interest in disability sport for a long time. It is entirely fitting that we take that step, building on what happened at the Commonwealth games and recognising that, although para-sport has always been integrated into the games, it has never been integrated to quite the extent that it was on this occasion.</p><p>It seemed to me that, from ScotRail renaming stations such as Springburn the witty and games-appropriate &#8220;Sprintburn&#8221; to the millions of people who bought tickets for the games or watched them on television, almost everyone was in on the biggest party that Glasgow has ever thrown. It was not only Glaswegians who were involved. There were athletes from around the world, games venues in Edinburgh, Lanarkshire and Angus and volunteers from throughout the United Kingdom and beyond. Perhaps I will say a little more about the volunteers in my closing remarks.</p><p>A quick glance at social media in the evenings helped to tell me which of my relatives and friends were in town for the games and which cousins were coming back to Glasgow from around the UK to watch the games. However, the prize for distance travelled in my family goes to a cousin who came from Tasmania to watch his two sports&#8212;judo and the triathlon&#8212;and could not believe the transformation in the city of his birth. Given that he is the same age as me, I must admit that he put me rather to shame. We can but aspire to do better.</p><p>It all began with the baton relay. The relay was always going to be important in my constituency because, alone of all the sectors of the city, the north was the only one that did not really have a games venue. I regret that, but the baton relay was the main opportunity for communities in the north to join in the fun and excitement&#8212;and join in they certainly did. People lined the route wherever the baton went, and special praise must go to Depot Arts in Possilpark, which really went to town with a programme of activities second to none. The 8,000 people who turned up at Springburn park to witness the final event of the day&#8217;s baton relay also embraced the event with real enthusiasm, and we enjoyed music and sunshine for several hours before the baton arrived.</p><p>The opening ceremony was just the kind of event that was needed, with enough&#8212;just enough&#8212;pomp to mark beginning of the games and plenty of self-mocking and joyous Glasgow humour, which allowed everyone to join in. The sight of dancing tea cakes will stick with me for ever, although I will probably not eat many in the future. I do not have a habit of eating them at the moment, but that is neither here nor there.</p><p>Much about that night is memorable. All the performers deserve praise, but the joy on Nicola Benedetti&#8217;s face as she played and the marvellous voice of Pumeza singing one of my favourite songs, together with the wonderful dancers from Scottish Ballet, will be remembered for a long time. The volunteers who danced their hearts out for more than two hours were simply great.</p><p>I was at the opening ceremony but I was rather far from the field of play, so I missed the fact that John Barrowman had kissed another male performer but, when I heard about it, it just gave me an excuse to watch the ceremony again. Well done to John Barrowman and to whoever came up with the idea of making such an important point without a lecture being delivered or a word uttered. That is truly a part of the legacy of the games.</p><p>Scottish Labour&#8217;s amendment also makes reference to the UNICEF initiative that raised &#163;5 million from the audience and reminded us during the evening how difficult life can be for some children at home and further afield. I hope that it might become a feature of multisport events, or other sports events, in the future.</p><p>Then, of course, the games began. Every last one of our athletes&#8212;indeed every one of the athletes who participated&#8212;was remarkable, and many of them overcame great adversity in life to participate. The spectators cheered on the home athletes with great gusto and enthusiasm, but they cheered on other countries too, which was a joy to see.</p><p>I have a feeling that, if the bid for Glasgow to host the 2018 youth Olympics had been made after the Commonwealth games and not before, the outcome might have been influenced in Glasgow&#8217;s favour.</p><p>Our medal haul began on day 1 with the amazing Aileen McGlynn and her pilot Louise Haston adding silver to Aileen&#8217;s already impressive Olympic and Commonwealth games medal tally, and the Renicks sisters in judo leading a medal rush in their sport. The fantastic achievement of Hannah Miley in the pool began a games that culminated, as we know, in Scotland being placed fourth in the medal table with new records against the names of many of our athletes and our largest ever medal haul at a Commonwealth games.</p><p>We witnessed some amazing performances during the games. Time does not allow me to mention them, but they were truly remarkable. Nor does time allow me to mention every Scots athlete who won a medal&#8212;actually that is something to be proud of. I simply say, &#8220;Well done&#8221; to them all and to their coaches and families, who support them throughout the year.</p><p>The games began in glorious sunshine, but all too soon the weather deteriorated and we were faced with a downpour of almost monsoon proportions. Still the spectators came, with 120,000 of us lining the streets of Glasgow in the worst of weather to cheer on the people who were brave enough to compete in such conditions.</p><p>All too soon, the games were over, and now we must consider their legacy. What will that legacy be? How do we harness the enthusiasm for sport in our country that is a result of the games? Before the decision to bid was taken, a serious assessment was made of whether it would be possible to secure a legacy from such an event. The result of the study, which took the best part of a year to do, was that there could be a legacy, but it would have to be planned and programmed in from the beginning if it was to be realised. It is important that we remember that that was always part of the plan. Indeed, I think that it was a key factor in the success of Glasgow&#8217;s bid.</p><p>We have witnessed regeneration of infrastructure in the east end of Glasgow. The athletes village will provide new affordable homes as well as houses for rent. The tourism sector in the city has enjoyed a boom and is likely to be able to capitalise on return visits for some time to come. I hope that that will result in more jobs, with decent pay and good working conditions.</p><p>Unemployment in the east end of Glasgow remains stubbornly high, as it does in several other parts of the city, including my constituency. There are legacy programmes to try to counter that. I single out the apprenticeship programme that has been operating in Glasgow for some time, at a cost of more than &#163;50 million. I have met a number of young people who have successfully applied to join the scheme. It is no exaggeration to say that it has made a difference to their lives and life opportunities.</p><p>A recent survey carried out for Glasgow City Council revealed that some two thirds of the people in the sample cohort in the east end who were out of work reported that they had a long-standing illness, disability or infirmity. How do we improve the health record of Glasgow and Scotland? Can that, too, be a legacy of the games? In my view, encouraging young people to walk or cycle to school, and giving more encouragement to people who walk or cycle regularly, would be a start. We have to start somewhere, so we could start there. Walking and cycling are not activities that require a great deal of infrastructure. People just need encouragement and the get-go.</p><p>What of sport itself? That is perhaps the most interesting and challenging aspect of legacy. In an article in The Herald this week, Doug Gillon, who I reckon has covered at least 11 Commonwealth games, made the point that there should be a process of debriefing, learning what worked and being honest about what did not work. He said that we should look at how and what we fund in sport, too. He suggested that such analysis should be done independently, to ensure its rigour, rather than by the institute of sport or sportscotland, praiseworthy though they are.</p><p>Doug Gillon has a point. We know that Scotland performed particularly well in some sports and perhaps not as well as it might have done in others. We need to look at that and be honest with ourselves and the athletes about why that happened. As we look forward to the games on the Gold Coast, as the minister has urged us to do, we must also consider that the home nations, I think with the exception of Northern Ireland, did better in the games than they have ever done. We have to wonder whether we will be able to achieve such results on the Gold Coast&#8212;I hope that we will&#8212;and we have to start preparing seriously for those games.</p><p>Before much more time passes, we need to harness the enthusiasm that was so evident during the games and to encourage the entire country to become more active, more often. Some kind of event this week or next week to mark the end of the games and encourage momentum might have been a good approach. The athletes parade in Glasgow on 15 August might be a fitting moment to show that the momentum will continue and the impetus is still there. The games might be over, but their legacy must live on.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-10736.2, to leave out from &#8220;welcomes&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;congratulates all the community groups and organisations that worked so hard to ensure that the baton relay was a source of celebration in their communities and a fitting precursor to the Games themselves; considers that the initiative of UNICEF and the Games partners, which resulted in &#163;5 million being raised to support the children of the Commonwealth, was an ingenious project that will provide benefits for years to come; welcomes the determination of the Scottish Government and partners to continue to build on these strong foundations, driving forward a legacy with immediate effect based on the core values of the Commonwealth Games, humanity, equality and destiny, but which must also emphasise the need to encourage more Scots to be more active more often while continuing to encourage, support and develop the country&#8217;s athletes; looks ahead to 2018 when the next Commonwealth Games will be hosted by the Gold Coast; reflects on the further commitment and drive required to secure a lasting legacy that Scotland can be rightly proud of, and considers that the volunteers recruited to work at the Games should be a vital part of that legacy.&#8221;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>I assure the member that, although on occasion I might have been a little tired after a nine-hour shift, I did not feel that the work was too difficult or too hard.

Jackson Carlaw&#8217;s comments about the experience of Glasgow and about Glasgow being an inclusive city are right. He is also right to say that we need to begin the sporting experience in our primary schools. I go further than that and suggest that we need to begin that in our homes and in our nursery schools in order to ensure that our young people are physically literate and that we are able to develop that skill for them.</p><p>For those of us of a certain age, in case we feel left out, my father, who is 90, won a bronze and a silver medal in the Erskine homes Commonwealth games. He proudly told me that he is aiming for gold in four years&#8217; time. There is hope for us all yet.</p><p>I was struck by one of Elaine Murray&#8217;s comments because she reminded me of something that I had been thinking about last night: in effect, this year&#8217;s games are a legacy of the 2002 games. Those games gave Jack McConnell and Elaine Murray, who was then the sports minister, the inspiration to think that the games were something that Scotland and one its cities could do. At that point, it had not been decided where the games would be held; members will recall that there was a competition between Edinburgh and Glasgow for that honour. However, a direct legacy of the 2002 Manchester games was not only that the games were held in Glasgow, but that the Commonwealth endowment fund was established.</p><p>At the 2002 games, Jack McConnell was impressed by our athletes and their hard work and dedication. When he discussed with them the biggest challenges that they faced, they mentioned their facilities, coaching and other issues, but the issue that they all identified was that there was no money to help them to get to and from a games and that there was no set-up to allow them to be properly kitted out for their events. He thought that that was wrong, so he established an endowment fund that has continued to accrue over the years. Indeed, it still provides the money that helps our athletes to get to the games and enables them to compete to the best of their abilities.</p><p>That legacy may not often be talked about, but it is important and it continues to this day. It also helps us to take to events the size of the team that we do. It is easier for us to have a big team when it is a home games, but it will be a bit more challenging for us to take a team of the same size to the Gold Coast in four years&#8217; time. Let us aim for that and see whether we can meet that aim.</p><p>Liz Smith is right to say that it is difficult to define what the legacy should be and to query whether politicians should be part of that. The idea that primary schools should be the place where skills and interests are nurtured is absolutely right.</p><p>I was also taken by Liz Smith&#8217;s point about the broadcasting of sport. The Commonwealth games allowed sports that are not on our television daily to be broadcast into homes across the Commonwealth, which will no doubt do those sports a service. However, the effect goes further than that because many of those were sports in which women participate. Some of the sports were women only; others were for women and men. As we know, young women do not tend to pursue their interest in sporting activity beyond puberty as often as their male counterparts, which is an important element.</p><p>We talk a lot about football being the fastest-growing sport for women in Scotland, but it is still not regularly broadcast except on BBC Alba. I am very grateful for that, because it allows me to catch up with Glasgow City Women who, by the way, are usually the only Scottish team competing in Europe at that point. Long may that continue.</p><p>In that sense, the broadcasting of the games around the Commonwealth has been a great success.</p><p>I admit that I did not share John Mason&#8217;s scepticism about whether Glasgow should, could, or would be able to pull it off. Drew Smith was right to never be in any doubt about that. We saw that at a very early stage with the number of people who went online and backed the bid and the number of people from Glasgow, Scotland and beyond who signed up to say that they wanted the games to come to Glasgow because they thought that it was Glasgow&#8217;s time and that Glasgow could deliver. That was then followed up by the 50,000-odd people who applied to be volunteers.</p><p>During my volunteer journey, I met people from around the world. It took me aback that people from America and Slovenia came to volunteer in our games. In the team that I worked in there were people who had volunteered at Manchester and London. Interestingly, some of them are now on a Facebook page because they are going to volunteer to go to the Gold Coast, too. They might get more consistently good weather on the Gold Coast, but I doubt whether they will get as much of a welcome as they did in Glasgow.</p><p>John Mason was right to say that we have to think about the demographic of the volunteers, but we also have to recognise that if people are travelling a distance to be a volunteer, as many did, the likelihood is that they will be from a particular bracket of people who can afford to take on that kind of enterprise. From some of the information that the volunteers were given, I noticed that one person travelled every day from Lancaster. I cannot imagine doing that. In my team was a young man who had come up from down south without accommodation and had no accommodation for two days. He slept on sofas, when he could find one, until one of the other volunteers asked him to come and stay with them and he did that for the rest of the games. People were making real sacrifices and doing things that perhaps they should not have been required to do.</p><p>I wonder whether the free travel that came with the uniform and accreditation that was afforded to those of us who were travelling in and around the city would have been welcome if it had been extended beyond Glasgow to those who were travelling from Ayrshire and Edinburgh, for example. I realise that that is a difficult ask but it might just be something that could be looked at if we do anything like this again. The idea of providing that kind of incentive was a good one.</p><p>One of the things that has always struck me about the Commonwealth games, besides the fact that they also integrate para-sport with able-bodied sport, is that they are careful not to include events that require the host nation and athletes to make a great outlay of money to be able to participate in sport. They do not require custom-made kayaking, for example. They do not require countries to have that level of infrastructure and expertise. They include the kind of events in which countries are more or less able to participate with a relatively small amount of facilities. That is absolutely right and it is what we should be doing.</p><p>Colin Keir hit the nail on the head when he talked about &#163;100 trainers. That was really the point that I wanted to make. The barriers that are sometimes set up are ones that we should not allow to be there.</p><p>Drew Smith had a point. Today&#8217;s debate has been one in which we all want to give praise and thanks to people for their efforts, and so we should. Perhaps we should have regular, although not necessarily frequent, debates about the legacy of the games in the future. Jackson Carlaw mentioned that Glasgow used to be the second city of the empire. After those games, I think that we can safely say that it is now the first city of the Commonwealth.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>At the beginning of July, Pope Francis celebrated mass in Rome to commemorate the early martyrs of the church who were persecuted in the first century AD during Emperor Nero&#8217;s reign. During his homily, the holy father reflected on the fact that there are more Christian martyrs today than there were in the first centuries of Christianity. We, too, should reflect on that. In a way, that is what we doing in the debate tonight, so I congratulate Dave Thompson on securing the debate and allowing us to do exactly that.</p><p>If Pope Francis is right&#8212;and the evidence suggests that he is&#8212;the persecution of Christians must be one of the least remarked upon cases of human rights abuse in our world. It is one that is seldom discussed. On our televisions, we see thousands of Christians flee Syria, and in Egypt the plight of Coptic Christians is increasingly worrying. The irony is that the Ottoman empire, which covered most of the middle east in times gone by, was a multicultural area that saw Christians, Shias, Sunnis, Jews, Alawites and Druse people all living cheek by jowl, mostly peacefully.</p><p>It is estimated that some 3,000 evangelical and Pentecostal Ethiopians are imprisoned in their homeland because of their religion. As we have heard, in North Korea, the Government executes and tortures Christians, and in Burma Rohingya Muslims as well as Christians are abused on a regular basis. The blasphemy laws that have been introduced in Pakistan leave Christians open to charges that are unjustified, and we must not forget the bombing of the church in Peshawar that killed 80 people and injured many more.</p><p>The reasons why the persecution occurs will vary from country to country, from region to region and from situation to situation. It may happen because of religious intolerance or for any one of a number of other reasons, but whatever the reason it can never be right to persecute someone for their faith, no matter what that faith happens to be.</p><p>Whatever the rationale, that is never acceptable and it must be challenged wherever it occurs by people of faith and people of no faith. In doing so, we do not support one faith over another; rather, we stand up for all people and their right to freedom of conscience, thought and religion and their right to worship, to teach and to observe their religion in the way of their choosing. That principle is laid out for us in article 18 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p><p>Those of us in the chamber may not all be Christians or share the same faith, and we will come from different denominations. However, we all share respect for our fellow human beings and we try to uphold the human rights of our fellow citizens in the UK and those in other countries.

It is not often that we hear a cabinet secretary&#8212;or, indeed, a member of royalty&#8212;talk about something being pure dead brilliant, but on this occasion I think that they were both spot on.</p><p>In her 10-minute statement, the cabinet secretary had time to praise all the many people and organisations that contributed to making the games such a success. As I do not have time to mention them all, I simply want to add my praise and thanks to all those&#8212;with one exception, in the interest of modesty&#8212;that the cabinet secretary mentioned. I would also like to mention one or two additional people who deserve our praise and thanks. I do not think that the cabinet secretary missed them out deliberately; in fact, she included them in her comments.</p><p>We should mention the executive member for the games at Glasgow City Council, Councillor Archie Graham, who led on the games in the council; Bridget McConnell of the city council, who was involved in the bid from 2002, when the vision was first an idea, and who led in the department that delivered the venues and the sport and culture events; and Mike Hooper, the chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, who, although he always maintained the impartiality that we would expect of someone in that role, was always welcoming and ready to show support for Glasgow&#8217;s bid in the early stages, as well as after we won it in 2007. He will stand down in a few months&#8217; time, and he deserves our thanks and praise.</p><p>I also want to mention the cabinet secretary, who, since her appointment, has led from the front. I know that that is not always an easy task. I have described her position as the best job in Government, and it is, but it is not without its challenges, so I say well done to her and her team for everything that they have done.</p><p>I think that it is right for us to reflect on the wonderful events of the past two weeks. We have all enjoyed a marvellous experience. I am not sure that all the volunteers had limitless energy, as the cabinet secretary described&#8212;I, for one, am still knackered and do not expect to be anything other for at least another week, although that perhaps says more about me and my level of fitness than anything else.</p><p>It is important, too, that we recognise that the enthusiasm that Glasgow and Scotland showed for the Commonwealth games showed us that such a multigames, multisport event can provide a real impetus for change in our country. It can inspire people to be more active more often, as we all want them to be, and it can act as the spark that encourages an individual to take up sport and to see that through to become a competitor and, we hope, a winner in the future.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary knows, I am a supporter of the legacy programme that the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council have delivered but, ahead of Thursday&#8217;s debate, I invite her to say a little bit about how we can harness the impetus that exists and ensure that we do not waste any time but move quickly to ensure that the opportunities that the games have given us to make a step change in Scotland&#8217;s life and culture are taken.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games 2014"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>It is a pleasure to speak again in the chamber about Malawi and to consider our shared commitment to that country. I whole-heartedly agree with the minister&#8217;s comments about the involvement of UNICEF in the Commonwealth games. That initiative was amazing. It is the kind of thing that makes us wonder why we have not done it before. The opportunity of that captive audience there in the stadium and at home was too good to miss.</p><p>I had the pleasure of hearing the UNICEF ambassador, Sir Roger Moore, speak movingly and knowledgeably about his commitment to the cause and about how UNICEF plans to take forward the work that it will do with the money raised. For anyone who views Sir Roger Moore as the caricature that we sometimes see in Bond films, I can say that the Sir Roger who spoke before the opening ceremony of the games was a different person entirely. He is someone whom I could have listened to all night, but then I would have missed the opening ceremony, which probably would not have been so good.</p><p>While the initiative to support Malawi was begun by a Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition Government, over the years it has been a source of some pride in our Parliament that we have been able to come together in our support for Malawi and for international development. We recognise that, whatever our circumstances, the plight of people in Malawi and other countries is of such concern that we will work above and across the political divide to provide assistance where we can.</p><p>In our schools and colleges, and in our churches and community organisations, people from a diverse range of backgrounds and interests come together to support our brothers and sisters in Malawi, and they expect no less of us. That is why I was delighted last week that, during the Commonwealth games, the minister was part of a photo call with the Malawi and Scottish netball teams following their match. The coming together of two teams who had just battled it out on the court, in recognition of the partnership that our two countries enjoy, seemed to me to be a very good symbol of that work. I was only sorry that my volunteer pass did not give me access to the venue so that I could go along and cheer on the minister and both teams.</p><p>The recent report produced by the University of Edinburgh for the Scotland Malawi Partnership identified just how effective that work in Malawi over the years has been. Estimates contained in that report would suggest that approximately 2 million Malawians have benefited directly from the activities of SMP members, with many more benefiting indirectly. The report suggests that as many as 4 million have been affected by work undertaken by SMP members. Of course, the relationship is not a one-way street. Some 300,000 Scots are estimated to have benefited indirectly from those inputs. It is important to remember that it is a two-way relationship.</p><p>We will all know of examples from our constituencies and regions, not least because half of Scotland&#8217;s local authorities are members of the Scotland Malawi Partnership and involved in that vital work. My local authority in Glasgow is particularly active. The Lord Provost has a special fund that is used to support education, water, health and sanitation projects in Malawi.</p><p>City Building, the arm&#8217;s-length construction and maintenance organisation, which happens to be based in my constituency, has built two prosthetic and orthotic clinics at Lilongwe central hospital, in partnership with the charity 500 miles. It has refurbished part of the former town hall in Lilongwe to transform it into a public health clinic, including an optician&#8217;s and a dental suite. It has also built an HIV-AIDS clinic at Chikwawa district hospital. Each of those facilities is making a real difference to the lives of local people.</p><p>Perhaps the most inspiring example of all is the Malawi leaders of learning programme, which Glasgow City Council runs with Malawi&#8217;s South West Division. That project delivers new school facilities but also encourages young students and teachers form Glasgow&#8217;s schools to work in Malawi, teaching and learning with their Malawian counterparts. Springburn academy has been involved in that work and it has been a real pleasure to hear the students talk about their experiences.</p><p>This year&#8217;s awards ceremony featured a presentation from a group of pupils who had just returned from Malawi and it was nothing less than inspiring to hear their accounts of their time there and to see how proud they were of their achievements and the confidence that it had given them as they talked about what they had done and the new friends that they had made. I have no doubt that the benefit was not just to the young people and teachers in Malawi whom they worked with but to the pupils themselves and the wider school community in Springburn. All that work is underpinned by the millennium development goals, about which my colleague Siobhan McMahon will say more in closing.</p><p>As the chamber will have noted, the Scottish Labour amendment also talks about the work being done by the Scottish Government complementing that of the Department for International Development. That is vital if we are to avoid duplication of effort and maximise effectiveness. After all, both Governments are working with the interests of Malawi at heart, so it is important that they learn from one another and regularly discuss and develop partnerships wherever and whenever it makes sense to do so. DFID might have expertise and reach that the Scottish Government does not have, but, similarly, DFID could learn from the approach that the Scottish Government has taken over time in developing projects on the ground, working with the Malawi Government to identify what its priorities are.</p><p>We must also remember the many organisations throughout Scotland that work in Malawi day in, day out. They are too numerous to mention but include the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, Mary&#8217;s Meals and a host of others.</p><p>I particularly want to mention Amnesty International, because it does a very difficult job: it reminds us that we have to be a critical friend of Malawi and that there are issues that we must take the opportunity, when appropriate, to raise with the Malawi Government&#8212;issues such as the anti-homosexuality laws that apply and the fact that the death penalty is still in force in Malawi, even though, thankfully, it is not often used these days. We have to be a critical friend and we have to raise those vital issues when the opportunity arises.</p><p>I applaud the many groups, organisations and individuals throughout our country that are involved with Malawi. I hope that they will continue their involvement for a very long time to come.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-10712.1, to leave out from &#8220;historically&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;in relation to health and education, as well as in response to new challenges, notably climate change and renewable energy, priorities set by the Malawi Government; welcomes the work carried out in and for Malawi by a wide range of schools, churches, NGOs and community groups around Scotland, and further welcomes the next funding round for Malawi and the Scottish Government&#8217;s ambition for Scotland to be a good global leader in the field of international development, championing best practice and innovation in partner countries such as Malawi and complementing the work done by the Department for International Development around the world.&#8221;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland and Malawi"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>Will the minister take an intervention?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland and Malawi"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>The cabinet secretary has been at great pains to say that three of the former constabularies&#8212;Strathclyde, Tayside and Northern&#8212;had endorsed the position of there being a standing firearms authority prior to the inception of the new service.

The famous Royston spire, which is the area&#8217;s most obvious landmark, will celebrate its 150th birthday next year and will not be forgotten in all the discussions about the area&#8217;s future.</p><p>Each of the housing associations that I mentioned has contributed to the regeneration of the area by building not just houses but warm, affordable and attractive homes. Many of the local residents and volunteers who began the process of regeneration around 25 years ago are, to their great credit, still involved. We owe them and the staff who support them a real debt of gratitude.</p><p>Similarly, Rosemount Development Trust has worked hard to preserve some notable buildings in the area and to provide premises to encourage businesses into Royston and employment opportunities for local people. Royston Youth Action provides support and activity for the young and not so young alike. Many other organisations operate in the area, of course, including Glasgow Housing Association and Toonspeak Young People&#8217;s Theatre, of which I am a patron. Therefore, I have an interest.</p><p>The fact that many of those organisations have significant anniversaries in the next few years has been the catalyst for co-ordinated community celebration, as the motion describes, and has spurred the organisations to think about what should happen next&#8212;what is needed to continue the regeneration of the area and how that should be taken forward.</p><p>As we have heard, a strategy group has been formed to discuss the changes that the community would like and to drive forward the required development. Spire View Housing Association has already commissioned a consultation exercise on community facilities. That work will influence the strategy group, which will no doubt want to carry out wider consultation before proceeding. However, it is fair to say that some ideas and themes are already beginning to emerge. Bob Doris rightly referred to the need for more shops in the area, and there is general support for the idea of better community facilities. That on-going discussion will be informed by the consultation that Spire View has already set in train.</p><p>Ironically for a community that is surrounded by a motorway, Royston can feel a little isolated. Better bus services and the reinstatement of the train line that once served the area have been suggested and are areas in which the Scottish Government might use its power and influence to bring about change and to help link Royston to neighbouring communities.</p><p>Mention has been made of the need to ensure the involvement of Glasgow City Council. I very much agree with that&#8212;so much so that I wrote to the council leader, Councillor Matheson, to ask him for the council&#8217;s co-operation. I am pleased to tell the Parliament that he responded positively, saying:</p><p>&#8220;I have instructed council officers to work with the Strategy Group to help deliver these aims. I understand that there has already been dialogue between the Strategy Group and senior officers and I hope that this will serve as a foundation upon which a suitable action plan can be constructed.&#8221;</p><p>I am sure that Councillor Matheson&#8217;s assurance of the council&#8217;s support will be very welcome.</p><p>As my time is limited, I will draw to a close, but first I will make two brief points. The first is that, in 2022, Royston can, if it chooses, commemorate the 80th anniversary of the controversial decision in 1942 to change the area&#8217;s name from the Garngad to Royston. Incidentally, that was ironically an initiative of the local headmaster and was opposed by local councillors. To people of my parents&#8217; and grandparents&#8217; generation, it always remained and will always be the Garngad. Would it not be appropriate to commemorate that change in the area&#8217;s name with meaningful physical change, building on the excellent work of the many community organisations that work so hard for the area?</p><p>My second point is that, as the surrounding multistorey flats are demolished at Forge Street and Rosemount Street and at Sighthill and Red Road, the skyline of the north of the city is beginning to change. Soon, Royston will once again enjoy the prominent position in the cityscape that it had for most of its 500-year history. In so many ways, this is the perfect time to look to continue the regeneration of Royston and, by working together, to help retain the sense of community that has always made Royston such a vibrant place in which to live and work.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Royston (Regeneration)"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>I was reflecting on the member&#8217;s comments about the need to include business in such discussions. However, I am also conscious of the fact that, often, regeneration has to happen because business has departed, sometimes leaving devastation in its wake&#8212;or, worse, contamination, which then has to be cleared up by others. Does the member have any comments on that aspect?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Royston (Regeneration)"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>I thank the Education and Culture Committee for its considered report, which raises a number of important issues that we do well to consider today. Like Stewart Maxwell, I may not be able to cover all the points I would wish to make in my opening speech, but as I have the opportunity to close, too, I certainly plan to return to them then.</p><p>I record my thanks to all the staff and the boards of Historic Scotland and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, who have worked hard, are working hard, and will continue to work hard to ensure that the transition from two organisations to one goes as smoothly as such mergers ever can. I have had the privilege of working closely with both organisations over the years and I have been impressed by their knowledge and expertise, as well as their commitment to our historic environment.</p><p>The respect that I have for both organisations has perhaps coloured my assessment of the proposal to merge them and I have had real concerns, as I have expressed before, about its effect. However, having had discussions with the management of both organisations, I am persuaded perhaps not so much that the merger is the right decision, but that the people who lead the two organisations will make it work, and I look forward to seeing their draft corporate plan when it is published. As the committee&#8217;s report makes clear, it is only at a later date that we will be able to judge whether the improvements that have been promised are realised.</p><p>I very much welcome the &#8220;Our Place in Time&#8221; strategy. I recognise that it is perhaps the first strategy of its kind in Scotland, but I would not want the chamber or, indeed, the general public to think that we have not had concern for our historic environment over the years. I draw attention to the great amount of hard work that Historic Scotland and RCAHMS put in to produce the Scottish historic environment policy&#8212;SHEP&#8212;series when Labour was in power, which was continued when the Scottish National Party took over. Those documents are very good, and they have certainly set the pace up until now.</p><p>I turn to the substance of the committee&#8217;s report. The committee noted that the bill&#8217;s accompanying documents do not specify the outcomes that the new body is to deliver, although a corporate plan will be published regularly by the new organisation. I agree with the committee that it is important that that document should identify the objectives that have been achieved, but it should also look at those that have not been achieved. I hope that measurement of the objectives in that way could influence subsequent plans.</p><p>In its evidence to the committee, Archaeology Scotland made an important point about the functions of the new body and suggested that the bill was unclear in that area. It rightly identified that, at present, more than 90 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s archaeological assets fall within the remit of planning authorities and that the bill did not make it clear whether that would change. The clarification that the cabinet secretary provided to the committee in that regard is welcome, but it will be important that all stakeholders share that understanding of what the role of the new body will be.</p><p>It would also be helpful if clarification could be provided concerning the respective responsibilities of historic environment Scotland and Marine Scotland. As historic environment Scotland will not be expected to undertake historic designations in marine protected areas, albeit that it will have the role of an expert adviser, there is concern in some quarters that that important subject area may fall between the two organisations. Some additional clarity on that might be helpful.</p><p>Another issue that seems to have taxed some of the people who gave evidence was the need to avoid centralisation of decision making. That is extremely important, and I know that the cabinet secretary indicated to the committee that she did not expect centralisation to be a consequence of the proposed change. Perhaps the minister could indicate in her closing speech how that will be guaranteed without a provision to that effect being included in the bill, as I would prefer.</p><p>As I have identified, the role of local authorities is particularly important when we consider our historic environment. They have a range of responsibilities, but one issue that they often identify is their difficulty in recruiting enough staff with a sufficient level of expertise to assist them in carrying out their duties. That connects to the issue of skills, which has been raised with members by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. It feels that the bill should make specific reference to the need to maintain and develop skills, which it argues is different from the need to educate others about the historic environment. Does the cabinet secretary feel that it might be helpful for the bill to include a reference to skills? I realise that ministers always seek flexibility with bills, and I understand perfectly why that might be the case on this occasion, but it might be helpful for the bill to include such a reference.</p><p>What the historic environment is has been the subject of some debate in the committee, and I see that the committee concluded that the most important point was that a definition was provided. In this case, that has been done in the strategy rather than the bill. Again, I imagine that the need for flexibility was key to that decision, but perhaps the definition could be reiterated in the corporate plan, to ensure that the relevant issues are robustly underpinned.</p><p>The issue of charitable status has also exercised people and the comments that they have made to the committee. Were charitable status to be obtained, that would make a considerable difference to the finances of historic environment Scotland. Will the cabinet secretary explain what benefits other than financial benefits might accrue from charitable status?</p><p>We know that some organisations are anxious that historic environment Scotland might seek funding from other sources. Indeed, it would, in a sense, be competing with organisations such as NTS in what is an already very crowded sector. We would want to avoid that.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I know that I must come to a close. I have so many other issues that I want to talk about, but I will do so later. Before I finish, though, it would be remiss not to comment on the fact that the bill sets out the functions of HES that must be underpinned by legislation&#8212;of course it does, as that is what the bill is about&#8212;which, of necessity, means that many of the functions referred to are those that are usually carried out by Historic Scotland; RCAHMS&#8217;s position perhaps gets much less focus in the bill, for what are, as I say, understandable reasons. Consequently, it would be worth while putting on record that the work that RCAHMS has done and the elements of that work that will carry forward are just as important.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13984.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13984", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Patricia Ferguson", "member_id": "80422", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Patricia", "last_name": "Ferguson", "left_house": "2011-03-23", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13984.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13984", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Patricia Ferguson", "member_id": "80308", "entered_house": "2007-05-03", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Glasgow Maryhill"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Patricia", "last_name": "Ferguson", "left_house": "2007-04-02", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13984.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13984", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Patricia Ferguson", "member_id": "80030", "entered_house": "2003-05-01", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Glasgow Maryhill"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Patricia", "last_name": "Ferguson", "left_house": "2003-03-31", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13984.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13984", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Patricia Ferguson", "member_id": "80153", "entered_house": "1999-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Glasgow Maryhill"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Johann", "last_name": "Lamont", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p></p><p>1.

It is an immense privilege for me to speak on behalf of the Labour Party and to move an amendment in my name at the point when the people of Scotland are making an important decision. If we are to come together after that decision has been made, it is important that we do not impugn the motives of those who are arguing for no or for yes&#8212;we all care deeply about our country.</p><p>Before I set out the case for a no vote, I want to talk about how we got here and the importance of settling the question. Earlier today, I had my weekly set-to with the First Minister and we debated the current issues in our usual robust and forceful way&#8212;it is important that we do that. Over the next four weeks, we will no longer be focusing on debating with each other; we will be talking directly to the people of Scotland&#8212;something that I have welcomed and relished since the debate began. I recognise the interest and appetite in our communities and towns to have such debates.</p><p>It is no secret that I did not support holding a referendum. While I respect the mandate that the current Government has to hold it, I believe that its prominence has had negative consequences. Only last night, a woman expressed to me her concerns about the way in which families and communities have been divided and, equally, about the way in which Scotland has been on pause on the big decisions facing our country.</p><p>It is incumbent on us all to find a way through the debate without leaving us so damaged at the end that we cannot go back to democratic debate and policy making. I embrace the opportunity that the referendum presents&#8212;the opportunity finally to answer the constitutional question and agree among us the settled will of Scotland. Whatever happens on 18 September, Alex Salmond can claim this important legacy: the question on Scottish independence will have been put to the Scottish people and they will have been given a fair opportunity to answer it.</p><p>For those who have argued for Scottish independence for so many years, I am pleased that they will get the opportunity to test their argument in a vote. For those of us who believe that we are better off as part of the United Kingdom, we will get the chance to reaffirm our place in the UK. If we vote no, the UK will no longer be a historical decision taken by the few; instead, Scotland&#8217;s place in the United Kingdom will have been actively confirmed and decided by the democratic will of the people. For all of us who care about a better Scotland, it is vital that we agree on a settled constitution and get on with the job of delivering that vision.</p><p>I have heard many times over the last few weeks that this is not a vote for Alex Salmond. I agree. However, it is his prospectus that is being put to the Scottish people, so I congratulate the First Minister on his determination in bringing this referendum before us and giving us the opportunity to settle the question once and for all.</p><p>The First Minister will not be surprised to know that there is much that I disagree with in his statement. My party has made clear this week its feelings on the latest NHS argument. I also do not believe that the people of Scotland should be going to the polls with such little certainty on something as basic as the currency. I have serious doubts about the cavalier economic assumptions and estimates that have been presented to counter the predictions of the independent experts who say that we will have &#163;6 billion-worth of cuts to make. Indeed, in the past 24 hours, those doubts have been compounded by comments made by Sir Ian Wood.</p><p>It is for Alex Salmond to decide which arguments the yes campaign will deploy. That will not stop me asking the hard questions, rebutting his assertions and countering his claims. I will put forward our case as to why people should vote to stay in the UK.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>Let me make some progress.</p><p>Ultimately it will be for the people of Scotland to decide who is right and what is best. I have every confidence that they will get that decision right.</p><p>As a young woman I instinctively believed that Scotland should stay in the United Kingdom, but in the last period I, like many of my fellow Scots, have tested the arguments. While some people have come to a different conclusion, there is no doubt that people who are voting yes and those who are voting no often share the same ambitions for a fairer, more equal Scotland. That will be the challenge for us after the referendum vote.</p><p>I hope that the people decide to vote no, because I believe that it is in the best interests of Scotland. I believe it with my head and with my heart. With my head, I look at the economic forecasts from the experts and I believe that the strength of the United Kingdom gives us the best chance of achieving our goals here in the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>On areas such as pensions and welfare, I believe that the pooling and sharing of resources across 60 million rather than 5 million makes sense. On jobs, I believe that, by being part of something bigger, we are given the security and the opportunity that we want. On the currency, I believe that we should be in a monetary union with the rest of the United Kingdom, but with Scottish voices representing us at the heart of Government.</p><p>Those are the arguments of the head, but the arguments of the heart are every bit as strong. I believe in working in partnership and in co-operation with our friends and neighbours, whether they are in Liverpool or Manchester, Belfast or Cardiff, Glasgow or Edinburgh. That is a co-operation that saw us stand up against fascism, create the welfare state, create the national health service and make significant steps on the road to tackling inequality and disadvantage.

I believe that we should celebrate what we have in common, not emphasise our differences.</p><p>I believe that borders&#8212;literal or metaphorical&#8212;should be broken down, not thrown up where they are not necessary. It is simple for me. I believe that sovereignty lies with the Scottish people, and we can choose to share that with our neighbours when it is in our interests without compromising our Scottishness. Therefore, I disagree with Alex Salmond. He disagrees with the values that are at the heart of the Labour Party&#8212;that, by the strength of our common endeavour, we achieve more than we achieve alone.

However, I believe that it is equally true if there is a no vote. In one month, the constitutional question will be answered and the settled will of the Scottish people will be decided, whether that is to go our own way or to continue to work in partnership with our neighbours.</p><p>I have never claimed that a no vote will unlock a bounty of treasures and opportunity. Indeed, I welcome the comments of Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney that independence, equally, is not a magic wand. Even Alex Salmond admitted that we would face serious challenges and that it would not be easy. To my mind, a constitutional arrangement is not an end in itself. We disagree about what the best arrangement is for delivering our ambitions, even though many of those ambitions are shared right across the chamber.</p><p>Therefore, on the constitutional question, on which we fundamentally disagree, let the people of Scotland decide on 18 September, and then let us get on with the hard work of changing Scotland, whatever hand we are dealt. Let us move past grievance and alibi, and talk about what we can do rather than what we cannot. We all agree that the educational attainment gap in Scotland must be improved if we are to achieve a fairer society. We all recognise that our NHS and our care system face real pressure from changing demographics, and that we must act and innovate if our sick and vulnerable are to get the treatment that they deserve.</p><p>I make this commitment: if there is a yes vote, I will accept it. However, if there is a no vote, I demand an equal commitment from the people on the other side of the chamber. That is because not only will politics never be the same again; it cannot ever be the same again. Rather than have a politics that elevates the interests of party and the political priorities of politicians, we need another kind of politics. We need the Parliament to mature and do its job, opening up its thinking to the challenges that people face in the real world with decisions that will define the future of our country and the wellbeing of our people.</p><p>We stand at an important moment in the history of our country.

Indeed, I was elected as a councillor for Royston on 16 December 1993. I was delighted to be Royston&#8217;s local representative during those years.</p><p>I can amplify many of the points that Bob Doris and Patricia Ferguson made about the good work of local activists in Royston. I can speak in particular of Charlie Lunn, Tilly McIlroy and Jackie Kerr. The three of them led the regeneration process to ensure that local people got access to good-quality housing. We have seen success in Royston and people speak volumes about that because the individuals I referred to ensured that the process was genuinely community led. I say very respectfully that they ensured that the community had its say during those years, particularly from the mid-1990s to 2005 and 2006, when we saw a number of investments that made a significant difference to the area that I would refer to as the Garngad. I was conditioned during my years as an elected representative of the area to call it the Garngad, and I welcome what Patricia Ferguson said about taking forward the issue of its name in 2022.</p><p>The challenge that the Rosemount Development Trust faced was the challenge that Bob Doris referred to: the unacceptable employment statistic that we faced. At that stage, 23 per cent of the local population were unemployed. The Rosemount Development Trust wanted to ensure local opportunities for development and opportunities for unemployed people. Challenging that unemployment statistic was a priority for the trust, which is why we developed the Rosemount workspace. As we speak, more than 300 people are employed on that site. That investment is welcome.</p><p>As other members have said, it is important that we continue to develop the process and challenge the unacceptable health statistics, but the other challenge that we face in the Garngad&#8212;or Royston, as it is referred to in the motion&#8212;is educational attainment. I was delighted to be one of the people who led the campaign to ensure that St Roch&#8217;s secondary and primary schools were retained in the Garngad. Ensuring that local youngsters have genuine opportunities to improve their educational attainment is absolutely crucial in the Garngad area. Anything that we can do in this Parliament to ensure that action is taken in that respect is extremely important.</p><p>This is a good example of local activists ensuring, with the professional support that they have received from the officers involved in the local area, that they genuinely make a difference. We should learn from those lessons.

We should also consider the very good work that has already taken place. I give special mention in that regard to the Alexandria and district community dog management centre, whose whole emphasis is on ensuring that people are responsible enough to be dog owners in the first place prior to their taking ownership of a dog. The emphasis of the project is on ensuring that people are trained to be dog owners rather than on training the dogs.</p><p>The challenge that faces the Parliament is to ensure that we look at all the available evidence, including that on muzzling and the examples of good work in places such as the Alexandria dog centre.

Too many children have suffered because of the current dog laws and action must be taken.</p><p>Last month, I arranged a meeting with the First Minister and a number of mothers whose children have been the victims of dog attacks: Veronica Lynch, whose daughter, Kellie, was killed by two Rottweilers in 1989; Zoe Hall, whose four-year-old daughter, Sophia Bell, was seriously injured by a Labrador; and Broagan&#8217;s mother, Tracy Cox. The accounts that we heard were harrowing.</p><p>The Daily Record has printed a number of pictures of children who have suffered from dog attacks. They do not make comfortable viewing, but they tell the real story of the anguish that many families have experienced as a result of serious dog attacks.</p><p>So, what can we do? As a result of last month&#8217;s meeting involving the First Minister, the Scottish Government has launched a consultation document. I welcome that and the extremely positive discussions that took place during that meeting with the First Minister.</p><p>I also welcome the First Minister&#8217;s commitment to a summit to discuss how we take the issue forward and to look at how to promote responsible dog ownership. I hope that that will allow further debate on the issue and that we will consider putting in place robust measures to develop responsible dog ownership.</p><p>I put on the record the fact that I am strongly in favour of compulsory microchipping. We must look at using that method to promote responsible dog ownership. A lack of compulsory microchipping or any mandatory licensing suggests that we are not serious about ensuring responsible dog ownership. Proper enforcement of those control measures, combined with the regular maintenance of a central database, would be integral to their success. We would have to put in place the necessary resources to make a compulsory database a success.</p><p>Another measure that might be worth considering is the introduction of a restricted breeds list that is similar to the Irish model. The Irish list includes two breeds that are banned in the United Kingdom and large breeds such as Rhodesian ridgebacks, German shepherds and Rottweilers. Those animals or crosses of them must be muzzled in public places and walked on short leads by people who are no younger than 16. Those dogs earned their place on that list not because they are perceived to be more dangerous than other dogs or more aggressive than Jack Russells or Yorkshire terriers but because of their physical attributes. Their weight, height and jaw strength make them possibly dangerous dogs in public.</p><p>Broagan McCuaig was attacked for six minutes while she was being rescued by a grown man who punched and kicked the dogs that were mauling her. As I said, if it was not for that bravery, she would not be here to tell her story. Following such attacks, it often transpires that the owners were not fit to be owners. If a restricted breeds list was put in place, perhaps we could prevent such individuals from being owners.</p><p>More focus should be placed on assessing owners and considering the environments that dogs are kept in. When a family wish to rehome a dog from an animal charity such as the Dogs Trust, they are often required to undergo a home assessment. There is scope to introduce such measures for the ownership of dangerous dogs.</p><p>In the comfort zone of the debating chamber, it would be easy for us to play it safe and not consider introducing muzzling, licensing, microchipping or a restricted breeds list. However, we owe it to Broagan McCuaig and all the other victims to take robust action in a way that will make a genuine difference.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Dog Control Legislation"}, {"date": "2014-01-08", "body": "<p></p><p>9.

Taxation may not be everyone&#8217;s most exciting topic, but I find it extremely interesting, and the bill is particularly significant, as it is to become the underpinning legislation as we move forward, whatever the constitutional settlement.</p><p>As I said when I spoke on the subject in May, one of the problems of UK tax legislation has been its emphasis on the letter of the law as against the spirit or intention of the law. As a result, we have had situations in which the wider public has been clear that tax should have been paid, but some taxpayers have avoided tax quite artificially. That has been referred to already.</p><p>That is particularly galling for ordinary members of the public who, whether employed, self-employed or retired, are pretty strictly regulated by the various tax authorities. Therefore, I welcome the more principles-based approach in the legislation. I hope that that approach will also be taken in future Scottish tax bills.</p><p>On the subject of principles, like others, I am happy to welcome the emphasis on Adam Smith&#8217;s maxims, including, in particular, the one that says that taxes should be proportionate to the ability to pay. In the committee, we discussed the intricacies of that approach, and the differences between proportionate and proportional. I admit that those differences have now escaped me. However, it is clear that there are some taxes, such as council tax, that are not really linked to the ability to pay, except in the loosest possible sense. I hope, as we move forward, we can remember that principle, and that new and amended taxes will be more proportionate.</p><p>The issue of certainty has come up many times as we consider the bill. That is one of Adam Smith&#8217;s maxims that we all support. However, I continue to think that the demand for certainty can sometimes be a smokescreen and can mean only more certainty for those who want to avoid paying tax. Therefore, I support the cabinet secretary&#8217;s insistence that we stick to a principles-based approach, including having a wider general anti-avoidance rule than seems to exist in the UK.</p><p>Only two relatively small taxes are being fully devolved, while income tax is not really being devolved at all, as we will have only partial control over one aspect of it. That could, frankly, give us the worst of both worlds, with an already complex UK income tax system becoming more complex and therefore more expensive to operate. That is the downside of devolution and, in particular, of sharing a tax rather than devolving it.</p><p>Another factor in this is the block-grant adjustment that Michael McMahon referred to. It is disappointing that, having promised to devolve those two taxes, it now seems that Westminster is attempting to backtrack and keep its hands on as much of them as it possibly can. That does not bode well for the vague assertion that more tax powers might&#8212;or may; or could; or should possibly, at some stage, given the right circumstances and the right Government at Westminster, and on the assumption that the UK does not leave the EU and does not go completely bankrupt&#8212;be devolved in the event of a no vote.</p><p>However, I prefer to be optimistic and look forward to our taking control of the whole range of taxes, as normal countries do. We will probably have to start off by modifying the UK system but, at some stage, we will have the challenging opportunity of writing our own legislation for those major taxes. I look forward to that exercise.</p><p>The great thing about what we are doing today is that we are setting out a direction of travel. We want to do things our way, in a way that fits Scotland&#8217;s needs.

First, it makes absolute sense. We are responsible for education, preparing young people and others for the workplace. We are responsible for healthcare, when people cannot work. We are responsible for getting more and better housing. We are responsible for trying to secure more and better jobs. The missing ingredient in the package is welfare and benefits, on which we should be able to decide.</p><p>We need a system that helps and encourages folk to work if they are able to do so, but there are many faults with the current system. We have heard a lot about that this afternoon and I am sure that we will hear more. In particular, people are not financially better off when they get into work, and they still need benefits on top of their earnings so that they can manage to live, and the current cuts are hitting women, disabled folk and younger people in particular.</p><p>My second main reason for wanting this Parliament to have responsibility for welfare is because it has shown an appetite across the parties, particularly Labour and the SNP, for dealing with welfare. We set up the Welfare Reform Committee, although we have not set up committees to consider many other reserved matters. When Labour asked for measures to deal with the bedroom tax, it was pushing at an open door, because many of us, including cabinet secretary John Swinney, detest the bedroom tax. The main challenge was how to tackle the tax while remaining within the rules.</p><p>We have had a number of briefings for the debate, including from the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland. According to CPAG, recent reforms that are having the most impact on children are: real-terms cuts; reduced entitlement to tax credits; reduced value of child benefit; and sanctions and benefit delays. The first three reforms have eroded and reduced benefits, but sanctions leave people with absolutely no income. That is what I find so awful about sanctions and benefit delays. All income can be stopped, for the slightest of reasons. How is anyone meant to cope with that?</p><p>We will not be able to vote on the amendment that Alison Johnstone lodged, which called for a &#8220;citizen&#8217;s income&#8221;.

What I want to stress is that Labour and the SNP want to move in the same direction, towards a good, strong welfare system&#8212;our approach to the bedroom tax is an example. As part of that, I like the suggestion that there should be a certain level of unconditionality, whereby people are entitled to a certain income, no matter what. That is what we do for prisoners&#8212;I presume that that is what everyone should be entitled to.</p><p>I am running out of time, but I want to mention food banks. On Monday I met one of the local co-ordinators for the north and east of Glasgow. She and I are both convinced that more people need to use food banks than are currently accessing them. A lot of people are reluctant even to go to a food bank and ask about getting help. When they do so, they find that they must have a voucher. The DWP does not give out vouchers, citizens advice bureaux do not give out vouchers, and many general practitioners do not give out vouchers. It is not easy to get food from a food bank. The Trussell Trust has a strict system for how often people can access food parcels, and&#8212;frankly&#8212;someone who has been sanctioned for 13 weeks cannot do so often enough.</p><p>The idea that food bank use is greater than the actual need strikes me as totally unbelievable. I am convinced that, in my area at least, the need is greater than the current level of use.</p><p>The Equal Opportunities Committee has been looking at a range of issues, and the Parliament received good briefings for today&#8217;s debate. I cannot go into them in detail but I will mention them in passing.</p><p>On gender, the Engender briefing talks about how women are being affected by the cuts so much more than men: &#163;5.8 billion of the changes are hitting women, whereas the figure for men is only &#163;2.2 billion.</p><p>On disability, Inclusion Scotland has briefed the committee that the programme of welfare reform is having a devastating and disproportionate impact on disabled people in Scotland.</p><p>The Equal Opportunities Committee will take evidence on young homeless people tomorrow. Action for Children has stated:</p><p>&#8220;Some young people also face sanctions on their housing benefit when they access certain training courses.&#8221;</p><p>My question for the anti-independence parties, especially Labour, is: will they support responsibility for welfare policy coming to Holyrood whatever the vote in September, and if not, why not?</p><p>The sad fact is that a no vote is very unlikely to produce more devolution. That is what I find so disappointing about Labour&#8217;s position in the chamber, although it is clear that Labour members outside the Parliament, such as Bob Holman in the east end of Glasgow, are strongly supporting independence. Why is the Labour Party putting the constitution ahead of the real needs of constituents? Why is the Labour Party so focused on the constitution and refusing change? Why will the Labour Party not just choose what is best for needy people? Surely Labour accepts that it and the SNP at Holyrood would together produce better welfare solutions than would Labour and the Conservatives at Westminster?</p><p>Even if we give the Labour amendment the benefit of the doubt and assume that the party will win the 2015 UK election, the Tories are likely to be back in 2020 and they would undo anything positive that Labour had done.

We must think about that, because if we want to be peacemakers, sanctions or a boycott of one party will not move us in that direction, and nor will flying a flag from Glasgow city chambers.</p><p>What is the situation between Israel and Palestine? Israel has some 8 million people and Palestine has only 4 million, so Israel is much bigger. Israel spends $18 billion on its defences, Palestine clearly spends next to nothing. On the surface of it, Israel looks like the big, strong country, and Palestine or Gaza is the smaller, weaker one. It is clear that there are far more casualties on the Palestinian side, so on the surface of it we should all support Palestine.</p><p>Is it as simple as that? Israel might have a population of 8 million, but it is dwarfed by larger players in the region, such as Egypt, with its population of 82 million, and Iran, with 77 million. Israel&#8217;s defence spending might be $18 billion, but Saudi Arabia&#8217;s is $59 billion.

Is there a danger of our changing the balance in the region by stopping supplying Israel while still supplying other countries?</p><p>We can and should be ready to challenge any country when it does wrong. In the Bible, God is severely critical of his people, the Jews, when they go off track. We should not blindly support any one country, even our own. However, at the same time we should not blindly oppose any one country.</p><p>All that I am asking is whether we are being consistent in the standards that we are setting for Israel and for other countries. We have heard many claims and counterclaims in this situation: Hamas and others accuse Israel of indiscriminate bombing, while Israel accuses Hamas of deliberately firing rockets from civilian sites and deliberately encouraging civilians to gather around targets. Many want the blockade to be lifted and more cement allowed in, but Israel says that that cement is used for the Hamas war effort.</p><p>I do not think that any of us here today has the means or ability to weigh up all these claims and counterclaims right now.

I do not know whether it is because of my personal make-up, but I did not share Drew Smith&#8217;s confidence that everything would work. I wondered whether we could fill the venues for some of the minor sports, what the weather would be like, whether an external event would disrupt the games and whether it was wise to have the thanksgiving service in the cathedral before the games had happened. However, I am glad to say that all those concerns were unfounded and that things clearly went extremely well.</p><p>I could list a range of things that could have gone better&#8212;I will mention one or two of them as I go&#8212;but I think that we have to keep any such comments in perspective.

We had the city of culture, we had the garden festival and we had the champions league final. We want that process to continue, now that we have shown what we can do.</p><p>Would we do things differently in the future? Of course. We always want to be learning and doing things better. For example, was the &#163;90 million for security a bit over the top? We had a lot of police, a lot of military and a lot of private security personnel. Were there too many?</p><p>I guess that that is a question to which there can never be a right answer. A lot of high-profile individuals, some of them potentially unpopular, attended the games and something could have gone wrong. I am extremely grateful that nothing did. For example, I was working at the gymnastics in the Hydro when members of the royal family came in and watched the sport. That seemed to be handled in an appropriate, low-key and relaxed way, although I am sure that more was going on behind the scenes.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson and I volunteered at the games.

By contrast, one of the most pleasant experiences that I had was last Saturday, when I was given the job of telling some of the boxing fans that they were getting their tickets upgraded. It was absolutely magic to see people&#8217;s faces when I told them that they were getting a better ticket.</p><p>On the Clyde-siders, it will be interesting to see in due course an analysis of those who took part. Were they a cross-section of the whole of society? I was in spectator services at the SECC, which is only one part of the team, although it was quite a large part.

However, the volunteers in the team that I was in seemed to be very white and very female. I wonder, too, whether the volunteers were mainly folk from better-off backgrounds. One Clyde-sider from down south told me that taking part had cost him &#163;2,000. Obviously, however, for local folk, there was virtually no cost in doing so.</p><p>It was good to have volunteers from different parts of the UK and beyond, although some of them suffered from a lack of local knowledge. One evening, the train stopped running to Exhibition Centre station and we were asked to explain to people how they could get home.

The media, the public and members of the Parliament tend to get caught up in the latest new story.</p><p>This afternoon, we consider the plight of persecuted Christians&#8212;not in one specific place, or at one specific time, but in a range of places around the world. An organisation with which I have contact and which focuses on the subject is Open Doors. It produces annually a list of the 50 worst countries in the world, under the categories &#8220;Absolute persecution&#8221;, &#8220;Extreme persecution&#8221;, &#8220;Severe persecution&#8221; and &#8220;Moderate persecution&#8221;.

It is number 1 on the Open Doors list and it is the only country in the category, &#8220;Absolute persecution&#8221;. Open Doors tells us that in North Korea some 50,000 to 70,000 Christians&#8212;close to a quarter of the Christian population in the country&#8212;live in concentration camps. Being caught with a Bible is grounds for execution or lifelong imprisonment, and parents normally cannot tell their children that they are believers, for fear that the children will innocently say something outside the family home.</p><p>The Barnabas Fund said in its briefing that Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world, with the second-largest persecuted group being Muslims. It could be argued that Christians are the most persecuted group of any kind in the world.</p><p>Today is an appropriate day for us to be discussing all this because Aid to the Church in Need tells us in one of its press releases that 6 August is the feast of Transfiguration for the Eastern Orthodox Church, which has been linked to a call for prayer today for peace in Iraq. In 2003, there were some 60,000 Christians in Mosul, but that figure is now down to almost none. For the first time in 1,600 years, no mass or Christian service is being held in that city.

Apart from anything else, Christianity is not a western religion&#8212;it comes from the middle east and has probably suffered from being linked to the west.</p><p>Secondly, I am not asking for aid to be linked to improving the lot of Christians. Part of Jesus&#8217;s teaching was that we should love our enemies and do good to those who persecute us. However, we should raise the issue with governments that we work with and, as far as possible, we should ensure that our aid is targeted at those who are in the greatest need, which may well mean working with third sector organisations rather than with the governments themselves.</p><p>A lot of what I have said relates to long-standing Christian communities such as those in Iraq, where even people just from a Christian background are being persecuted. However, in many countries, the strongest attacks are often against those who have chosen to change their religion to the Christian faith, which can follow from the concept that one state has one faith. That used to be the thinking here in Europe as well, but a fundamental belief of Christians is that each individual has the ability and responsibility to follow the way of their choosing. Many people of a more liberal or secular persuasion would agree with that fundamental concept of individual choice. Therefore, if I have an absolute bottom line to ask for today it is that each individual in this country and in every other country have the right to follow the religion of their choosing&#8212;or none&#8212;and that that be set out in a written constitution, whether for Scotland or for the UK.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Persecuted Christians"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>On behalf of all the 15,000 Clydesiders, including Patricia Ferguson and me, I thank the minister for her kind words to us.

However, the area is now occupied by a care home&#8212;obviously, that is a good thing, but it means that the shows no longer operate on the site.

All the buzz and colour was really exciting for youngsters and I know that it still is for many.</p><p>I am happy that so many showpeople have chosen to live in my constituency in the east end of Glasgow. However, these days, there seems to be a certain amount of inconsistency in how shows and showpeople are treated across Scotland. I certainly agree that local authorities should have the right to make the decisions for their areas, but there is a particular problem with a group such as the Showmen&#8217;s Guild, which operates throughout Scotland and is treated differently in different places.</p><p>The first major problem is whether the showpeople are allowed to operate at all. We had a proposed fair in Easterhouse, which lies just outside my constituency. Verbal assurance had been given that all would be okay and people and equipment were moving to the site, and so incurring costs. However, an objection was then lodged by the police, listing all the past crime in the area, despite the fact that most of that crime had absolutely nothing to do with any fair, and that was used as a reason for turning down the application.</p><p>Another problem, which has already been mentioned, is the widely divergent levels of fees that may be charged by local authorities. For example, I understand that Glasgow charges &#163;597, in comparison with Clackmannanshire&#8217;s &#163;61. We can look at the individual decisions, such as council decisions to refuse a licence, and discuss why each one was made, but we also need to look at the bigger national picture and consider whether discrimination is going on against a whole group of people. This is a group of people who are very much part of the tradition and culture of this country, as has already been eloquently said by others. Perhaps their way of life is not well understood by the majority of the population and there can be confusion between showpeople, Gypsy Travellers and other groups.</p><p>Are we looking for a local or a national solution? I accept that the issue is not just national, but I certainly think that it is a national issue, as well as having local dimensions. If we are serious about helping and protecting all minorities in modern Scotland, surely showpeople are one of those minority groups and one that very much needs and deserves our active intervention and support.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Showmen&#8217;s Guild (125th Anniversary)"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>Can the member guarantee that, if we stay in the UK, the Scottish budget will not be cut?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/25101.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "image_width": 60, "person_id": "25101", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "John Mason", "member_id": "80425", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Glasgow Shettleston"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Nicola", "last_name": "Sturgeon", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>Ken Macintosh started his speech with a reference to the late Sam Galbraith and I want to end the debate today&#8212;on behalf of all of us, I am sure&#8212;by paying tribute to Sam Galbraith.

As we have done so, support for yes has risen and will continue to rise.</p><p>This has been a heated debate, but one fact that has been established beyond doubt is that we are one of the world&#8217;s wealthiest countries. I find it sad that politicians on the no side struggle so hard to bring themselves to admit that. Last night, I attended in Leith a very good debate of undecided women at which Kezia Dugdale and Cat Headley, two rising stars of the Labour Party, put forward the case for no. They did that very well, but during the debate, under scrutiny from the audience, they were forced to admit that the better together leaflet that claims that Scotland is poorer than Pakistan was &#8220;probably misleading&#8221;. You bet it is misleading&#8212;it is outrageous, and if there is any decency on the part of the no campaign it will be withdrawn.</p><p>The reason why the no campaign cannot admit what the rest of us know is that once it does so the rest of its case falls apart.

It is tragic beyond belief that Labour in Scotland has become so assimilated by the Tories in the no campaign that it cannot see the reality that is staring everyone else in the face. Drew Smith said that the public own our health service, but in England it is increasingly Virgin Care that owns the health service.

First, I feel a sense of regret that our welfare state, which is so often held up as one of the defining achievements of the union, is being systematically dismantled, causing real and additional hardship to those in society who most need our help. There is now strong evidence that the Tories&#8217; so-called welfare reforms are failing people right across Scotland and that their cuts are having a devastating impact on some of the most vulnerable individuals, families and communities in our society. Indeed, when the Secretary of State for Scotland said, as he did in April, that we are part of &#8220;a fantastic system&#8221;, he demonstrated just how out of touch he and indeed the other unionist parties are on these vital issues. Regret and a heavy heart are what I inevitably bring to any debate on welfare.</p><p>However, standing as we are just five weeks from the referendum, I also feel a real sense of hope. We have before us a precious opportunity to change course and build, not overnight but over time, a social security system that meets our needs&#8212;one that supports the needs of our economy by equipping people better for the world of work, one that supports the needs of individuals by ensuring that those who work get a decent wage for the job that they do and one that supports the needs of the vulnerable by ensuring that we have the decent safety net that I believe, and I know many people agree, is one of the hallmarks of a civilised society.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate is an opportunity to crystallise the choice that is on offer&#8212;the choice between, on the one hand, increasing austerity and division under the present system and, on the other, a different, better, more progressive and more supportive path with independence.</p><p>As people consider that choice that will be before them on 18 September, they should do so in the knowledge that further Westminster cuts are still to come&#8212;cuts that will impact most on women, children and the disabled. As people consider that choice, I am confident that the policies that we have outlined and the vision that we put forward will encourage them to vote to take these powers into our own hands.</p><p>A perfect illustration of that choice, and a topic that we have discussed many times before in the Parliament, is the bedroom tax. Yesterday, the Welfare Reform Committee considered and, I am glad to say, agreed to support the section 63 order to transfer to the Scottish ministers the power over expenditure on discretionary housing payments. That welcome step means that we can now ensure that no person in Scotland need be adversely affected by the bedroom tax. However, it is, is it not, a democratic outrage that a tax that had no political or popular support in Scotland was ever introduced here in the first place?</p><p>Make no mistake: all that we are able to do with the bedroom tax is mitigate. We can only take money from other parts of the Scottish budget to mitigate a policy that, had this Parliament had a say, would never have been introduced. A section 63 order will not end the bedroom tax; only by this Parliament having the power to decide will we be able to do what the majority&#8212;I believe the vast majority&#8212;of people in Scotland want, which is to abolish the bedroom tax.</p><p>That is the nub of the debate that we are having today. With the United Kingdom parties now battling to outdo each other on how tough they can be on welfare, it is becoming clear that independence is the only way for us to achieve a system that treats people with dignity and respect. In &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221; we set out a vision and a range of measures that will start to ensure that we have a welfare system that is more suited to Scottish needs. We have said clearly that, if there is a yes vote, we will halt the roll-out of the universal credit and personal independence payments, we will abolish the bedroom tax and we will ensure that welfare payments increase in line with inflation to avoid the poorest families&#8212;those in our society with the least&#8212;being plunged deeper into poverty. We will increase the carers allowance to recognise the contribution that carers make and to end the situation whereby carers currently get the lowest rate of benefit of everyone who claims benefits.</p><p>All those policies will directly and positively impact on people&#8217;s financial circumstances and on their quality of life. If there is a no vote, no matter how hard we try&#8212;and we will&#8212;we will be unable to stop the rise in poverty that Westminster policies will cause.</p><p>There is no doubt that the impact is being felt most by the most vulnerable people&#8212;in particular, those with health conditions and disabilities. Rather than helping to support individuals, Westminster is ploughing on with flawed systems such as the work capability assessment, which has now been reviewed five times. I warmly welcome the report by the expert working group on welfare, which recommends that the current work capability assessment be scrapped. The Government has committed to doing that when the powers to do so are in our hands.</p><p>Just this morning, we have published a research paper that lays bare the impact of the UK Government&#8217;s reforms on disabled people. It finds that disabled people in Scotland are likely to experience significant and disproportionate loss of income due to the Westminster cuts. It is expected that, of the 190,000 existing claimants of disability living allowance who will be reassessed for personal independence payments, more than 100,000 will lose some or all of their disability benefits by 2018, with a loss of at least &#163;1,100 each a year. People who get enhanced mobility support could lose up to &#163;3,000 a year. Important though the money is, let us remember that, for people in those circumstances, that loss could take away more than pounds and pence&#8212;it could take away their very independence. In my view, making cuts of that magnitude on the backs of disabled and sick people is flatly wrong, and I believe that it is time that we got the powers to do something about it.</p><p>Independent research has recently concluded that the cumulative impact of welfare reforms on income is particularly severe for households with disabled children and adults, at about &#163;1,500 per year on average. That impact is more than double the average reduction faced by non-disabled households, although we all know that disabled people are already more likely to be in poverty and face higher costs of living than non-disabled people. It beggars belief that, in modern Scotland, we are prepared to stand by and watch the situation get worse.</p><p>Although disabled people are being hit disproportionately, they are not alone in bearing the brunt. We know from children&#8217;s charities that up to 100,000 more children will be pushed into poverty by 2020 if we stay on the Westminster path. In March, we published our child poverty strategy, which set out the progress that we are making on childcare, education and youth unemployment. It showed that, since devolution, under the current Administration and the previous one, there has been a real improvement in the rates of child poverty in Scotland, which is to be welcomed. We may disagree about the best way to combat child poverty, but everyone in the Parliament is united in wanting to see it eradicated within a generation. However, the latest figures show that the reduction in poverty that we have seen in recent years is now being reversed. Westminster cuts such as the reduction in in-work tax credits are reducing incomes for some of our poorest households.</p><p>As we always should, we will do everything possible in our power to ensure that no child lives in poverty or grows up in poverty. However, the bottom line is this: when policies from Westminster are taking us in the wrong direction, when they are undermining all our efforts and are cancelling out all that this Parliament is able to do, the case for us to take these decisions ourselves becomes overwhelming. By doing that, we can combine what we are already doing on education and support for young people with progressive policies on employment, welfare and benefits. With that approach, we can begin to make inroads into not only mitigating poverty but alleviating it for good. It will take time, effort and determination, but we will have the powers and the access to our vast resources&#8212;we are, after all, one of the richest countries in the world&#8212;that we need in order to make it possible. That has got to be so much better than standing by, powerless, while Westminster does its damage to the most vulnerable and to the very fabric of our society.</p><p>I want to start to draw my remarks to a close today by posing some questions specifically to my colleagues on the Labour benches. Labour&#8217;s Tory and Liberal Democrat partners in the no campaign support the welfare policies of the Westminster Government. I profoundly disagree with them, but at least I know where they stand. Today, I am pretty sure that Labour members will claim that they do not support the policies of the current Westminster Government. They will say&#8212;I suspect more in hope than in any serious expectation&#8212;that the answer to the problem is not independence but a stronger Scottish Parliament and a Labour Government at Westminster. Taking that at face value, I want to give Labour the opportunity to answer a couple of straight questions.</p><p>The questions that I would like Jackie Baillie to answer are these. First, short of a yes vote, what new powers is the Parliament guaranteed to get that will allow us to stop the assault on the incomes of the disabled, of women and of children? Secondly, even if there is a Labour Government at Westminster, which Jackie Baillie cannot guarantee, what will that Labour Government do differently on welfare, apart from abolishing the bedroom tax? What, precisely, is Ed Miliband going to do that is different from what David Cameron is already doing? Will Labour halt the roll-out of personal independence payments? Will Labour protect the disabled from the cuts that I have outlined, which they stand to face if personal independence payments go ahead, or is the reality that the disabled will face exactly the same cuts under Labour as they do under the Tories? These are important questions if we are to crystallise the choice that faces people on 18 September.</p><p>If Jackie Baillie is about to get up and say that, like me, she opposes these cuts but then argue that getting our hands on the decision-making powers is not the best way to address them, I put it to everyone in the chamber that she needs to be extremely specific about what Labour in Westminster will do instead, and then she needs to tell us what will happen if we end up with another Tory Government after all. I suspect&#8212;although I hope that I am wrong&#8212;that, at the end of her speech, we will still be waiting for those answers. That will prove that, whether the next UK Government is Labour or Tory, if we vote no, the outlook for the most vulnerable in our society will be exactly the same.</p><p>It is clear that, under successive Administrations, the UK Government has failed to deliver the changes that are needed to deliver a welfare system that is fair for all. Not only that, the so-called reforms that are currently under way are likely to make the situation worse. It is only with independence that we can create in Scotland a social security system that is fair and treats people with dignity and respect. It is only this Government and this Parliament that can stand in the way of Westminster implementing further measures that will cause poverty&#8212;particularly child poverty&#8212;to increase. The only way we can guarantee the powers to stop that happening is to take the power to decide those matters into our own hands, so that the future of our welfare system is decided not by Tory Governments in Westminster but here in this Parliament and we can build a better, fairer and more equal society.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the damaging and destructive impact of the UK Government&#8217;s welfare policies on women, children, disabled people and communities across Scotland; further notes that the worst of the cuts are still to come and that all three of the main UK unionist parties are determined to pursue this cuts agenda; recognises that an additional 100,000 children will be pushed into poverty, after housing costs, by 2020 as a result of these policies; also recognises that, by 2018, thousands of disability living allowance (DLA) claimants in Scotland will lose some or all their disability benefits as a result of the replacement of DLA with the personal independence payment; welcomes the fact that the Scottish Government has pledged to halt the roll-out of universal credit and personal independence payments, and recognises that only with the full powers of independence can the UK Government welfare cuts be halted.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>Will Jackie Baillie give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>Will Jackie Baillie give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>Will Jackie Baillie give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>Will Jackie Baillie give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>Will Jackie Baillie give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>What Jackie Baillie sets out is why people all over the UK should lose the same amount in benefit under the Tories.

That is partly because we have the lowest number of completions since 1947. That is witnessed in the social housing waiting list of 155,000 people.</p><p>One of the consequences of that has been the massive growth in the private rented sector, which has doubled in size to 300,000 households and contains people who have not been able to get houses either in the social sector or in the private purchasing sector. There is no doubt that the resultant rise in the private rented sector has placed too much power in the hands of landlords and letting agents and that, as a consequence, there have been unacceptable rent rises in some parts of the country.</p><p>That can be witnessed by the recent Citylets quarterly report, in relation to which Thomas Ashdown of Citylets said that urban hotspots are providing great returns for landlords. There is no doubt that that is true, and the report gives some examples. Average rents in the EH8 postcode in Edinburgh have experienced a year-on-year rise of 8.9 per cent. The figure for DD1, in Dundee, is 17.5 per cent, and the figure for G2, in Glasgow, is 21.5 per cent. Those inflation-busting rises heap misery on many of the families who are struggling in the private rented sector. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation reckons that, of the 120,000 households that are in poverty, 40 per cent are having to cut back on heating and a third are cutting back on food.</p><p>Through this bill, Parliament has the opportunity to do something about that by supporting Labour&#8217;s proposals to cap rent rises and to ensure that rent reviews take place no more than once a year. We are not proposing a specific scheme; we are asking for Parliament to agree to the principle and for the Scottish Government to lay regulations before Parliament by 1 April 2015. That would allow the Government, in proper consultation, to work up a proper scheme and to cap rises at an acceptable level.</p><p>The issue is also linked to tenancies. As the size of the market has grown, there has been a growing number of short tenancies. It is reckoned that 74 per cent of the tenancies in the market are short tenancies, which drive up rent. They also result in pressure being put on vulnerable tenants, who sometimes have to deal with housing problems not being addressed, repairs not being done and a lack of quality housing. Therefore, we propose a three-year tenancy, giving tenants the ability to terminate a tenancy with one month&#8217;s notice and landlords the ability to terminate contracts with two months&#8217; notice. Again, we want regulations on that matter to be laid before Parliament by 1 April 2015.</p><p>The recent welfare expert group recognised that issue and supported longer tenancies. It also supported capping rent increases. Surely, on this issue, if it is good enough for the Government&#8217;s expert group, it should be good enough to be included in the bill.</p><p>I urge Parliament to support the amendments.</p><p>I move amendment 49.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>The minister suggested that the amendments that I have lodged are somehow last-minute amendments.

However, Mary Fee and Alex Rowley also gave an accurate portrayal of some of the issues that are faced in housing in Scotland: the pressures that exist in relation to supply, the consequences of that in terms of a lack of affordable housing, and the impact of the growth of the private sector on rent levels that people are having to endure. There are wider issues that need to be addressed, aside from the issues with which the bill deals.</p><p>I was a bit disappointed by the process around the passage of the bill. I feel that Labour interacted quite positively with the bill. We lodged an awful lot of amendments that were, on the whole, rejected. Listening to the minister during the course of the debate, I was struck by the fact that we have a plethora of consultations and working groups. The minister herself said that the Government&#8217;s housing strategy was launched in February 2011, which means that it has taken three years for the bill to come to fruition. We seem to have a lot of talking shops, but what people really need on the ground is action and practical support.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s headline issue, which the Government wants to promote, is abolition of the right to buy. We have supported that; it is the right thing to do. However, I do not think that abolishing the right to buy will have the grand consequences that the Government envisages. The figure that Maureen Watt quoted&#8212;15,500 social rented houses being safeguarded over 10 years&#8212;is welcome, but when we have 155,000 people on social housing waiting lists, its impact will be minimal.</p><p>As for action on letting agents and landlords, a number of members have spoken about the growth in the private rented sector, which means that proper regulation is needed. Many letting agents and landlords are responsible, but there are a number of unscrupulous individuals, which is why proper regulation is needed. The bill will improve the situation, but if some amendments that were not agreed to had been taken on board, the bill could have improved it more.</p><p>A similar point is true of the measures on maintenance plans, which Sarah Boyack raised, and on electrical safety. Such provisions could have been strengthened.</p><p>I was disappointed that the Government did not accept my amendments to control rent increases and to introduce longer and more stable tenancies. I was particularly disappointed because between stages 2 and 3, I changed my amendments to give the Scottish ministers more time.

I thought that that was a reasonable way forward; the response that the task would be too onerous or too difficult is not satisfactory.</p><p>In such debates, members always trade a lot of statistics to back up their arguments&#8212;I acknowledge that I do it, too.

Almost weekly, I see people at my surgeries who stay in overcrowded accommodation and who cannot access adequate housing.

I make it plain that the burden of this statement is not connected to the announcement of &#163;14 million. I accept that that announcement should perhaps have been made on a different occasion. However, the burden of this statement is quite different and I am sure that members are looking forward to hearing it.</p><p>This is actually my first opportunity to brief members on the significant economic impact of the ambitious and ground-breaking innovation centres programme, and I welcome the chance to do so. Developed in partnership with the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, innovation centres are collaborations between universities, businesses and other partners to enhance innovation in and across Scotland&#8217;s key economic sectors.</p><p>When it was launched, the initiative was widely welcomed as having the potential to greatly improve university-business engagement, by bringing together the people who are best able to resolve many of the challenges that face industry in Scotland, while harnessing many new opportunities. I want to share with the Parliament some indications of positive progress and what we are beginning to expect in terms of impact from our significant investment.</p><p>As members know, Scotland has five universities in the world&#8217;s top 200&#8212;more than any other country per head of population. We have a track record of securing competitive research funding from a range of sources, which reflects the excellence and global reputation of our universities. Our universities excel when it comes to research; Scottish universities have more citations than those of any other country, relative to gross domestic product. We are disproportionately excellent at what we do.</p><p>The Government has shown its support for our universities and research through investments such as the global excellence initiative. In an independent Scotland we can and will do even more.</p><p>Our universities and research facilities are a core strength in our economy. They are an important growth sector, which is why we sought to improve the links between our universities and public and private sectors, to increase the economic and social benefits of innovation. We start from sound foundations. Our research pools, for example, have embedded a collaborative approach across the university sector, to provide a critical mass of research excellence, which enhances our competitiveness on the world stage. We were the first country to develop such a strategy.</p><p>Our collaborative approach has been instrumental in attracting international research centres to Scotland, such as the Fraunhofer centre for applied photonics and the first international Max-Planck partnership in the United Kingdom. That is why the British Council said in a recent report that</p><p>&#8220;a joined-up and collaborative sector, helped by its modest size and a Scottish ethos of education as a public good&#8221;,</p><p>is one of five strategic assets of Scottish higher education.</p><p>Nevertheless, we are always ambitious to do more. Innovation Scotland epitomises our approach. Launched last October, it gives focus and impetus to improving the effectiveness of universities and businesses working together to increase innovation in the economy. That approach is assisting in developing collaborative approaches to spin-out support, supporting easy-access intellectual property and extending the role of Interface to better facilitate business and academic partnerships.</p><p>Innovation centres are a manifestation of that approach in action. Research pooling was about improving the quality of our research through collaboration across the university sector, and innovation centres build on that research quality and collaborative strength by promoting innovation in a commercial context. Innovation centres are large-scale, ambitious projects of excellence. They are about developing the best environment for businesses and academia to interact in, taking innovation to another level. They are part of a cultural shift that brings the innovation and creativity of our academic sector to the heart of our business life and puts business drive firmly into the heart of our academic sector. The centres help the research community to understand the needs of its particular industry and they help industry to understand the assistance that can be delivered through research.</p><p>Scottish Government investment in the overall programme is substantial through the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council providing up to &#163;124 million over a six-year period. Around &#163;80 million of that is already committed to the first eight innovation centres, including &#163;2 million for MSc places to improve the connections between businesses and universities. This morning, I announced &#163;14 million from within the &#163;124 million that will support major capital and infrastructure investment across the programme. For example, the stratified medicine Scotland innovation centre, which I visited this morning, will receive &#163;4 million to help to secure national health service data sets and establish a next-generation genomic sequencing platform at its interim facility in Inchinnan.</p><p>We are under no illusion that these are large-scale ventures that will need time and patience for their potential to be fully realised, but the public investment that we are making is being more than matched by the innovation centre partners, who estimate their contribution to be around &#163;200 million in cash and in kind. That reflects the strong support from industry, which recognises the potential ambition of the programme. Those partners all come with high expectations and high reputations. Time precludes my naming them all, but they include GlaxoSmithKline, Thales UK, Amor Group, Philips Healthcare, Cisco Systems, Thermo Fisher Scientific&#8212;which I visited this morning&#8212;and Aridhia Informatics. There are many others, and it is not only the major global players that are involved. Our small and medium-sized enterprises are playing an active part and there are strong plans to ensure that the innovation centres are incubators for new activity.</p><p>The first phase of the innovation centre programme was launched last year, with the digital health institute, stratified medicine and sensors and imaging systems. Since then, two further innovation centres have been launched&#8212;industrial biotech and aquaculture. Later this year, we will see the launch of innovation centres covering oil and gas, big data and construction. The centres have already begun to make their mark on the landscape, and we should not underestimate the benefits that the centres will bring to the people of Scotland and to wider society. Stratified medicine is recognised as the future for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Tailoring treatment to those who will benefit most increases cost effectiveness. It is about getting the right drug to the right person at the right time.</p><p>The real burden of this statement is about what is happening now. Across the innovation centre landscape, we are seeing advances in skills, processes, collaboration and performance, leading to a significant longer-term impact on our economy. I can announce to Parliament today the first indication of the scale of that economic impact coming from the innovation centre programme. Based on the business plans for individual centres, the cumulative boost to the Scottish economy could reach a massive &#163;1.5 billion and up to 5,000 jobs could be created across the wider economy. Those figures reveal the impact that our world-class higher education sector working in partnership with business can deliver&#8212;more jobs, better jobs and a stronger economy. The figures illustrate the scale of the economic potential. We are now working on a comprehensive baseline economic impact assessment so that we can fully monitor and evaluate the success of the innovation centres as they all come on stream. That will confirm the considerable impact of the strategy.</p><p>There are opportunities&#8212;which we are now witnessing&#8212;for the innovation centres themselves to stimulate productive new collaborations. For example, stratified medicine is talking about working with big data, and the University of Edinburgh is leading a bid to secure the knowledge innovation centre on active and healthy ageing from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. The aim is to develop new health and care goods and services with business and economic models that enable systemic change. The innovation centres will play a role in strengthening the bid. The bid is truly collaborative, with expert partners from Scotland, the international commercial community and other parts of Europe working together to secure the project. We support that and we wish the bid team every success.</p><p>We believe that we now have a community of innovation across Scotland that is in a strong position for attracting European Union investment. Indeed, some of the innovation centres are talking to Scottish Development International about their connection to the wider international community.</p><p>We are maximising the potential of university-business collaboration to support innovation and economic growth. However, we can do more. Independence can reinforce our global approach by providing access to more of the policy levers required to support innovation, including key financial tools. For example, &#8220;Reindustrialising Scotland for the 21st Century: A Sustainable Industrial Strategy for a Modern, Independent Nation&#8221;, which was published in June, highlighted how, with independence, future Scottish Governments would be able to develop an overarching framework that aligns innovation activity and considers new opportunities to support innovation. That could be through tax incentives such as allowances on research and development expenditure or reductions in payroll taxes for employees directly involved in R and D, such as the scheme in the Netherlands.</p><p>Independence would also allow us to better support a thriving internationally connected and competitive university sector through the removal of a damaging immigration policy that often prevents our universities from attracting and retaining talented researchers. Our priority must be the reintroduction of the post-study visa, which will attract the best researchers from across the world to work in Scotland.</p><p>Innovation centres represent a major step forward in university-business engagement. They bring with them the opportunity for a wide range of social and economic benefits to Scotland. We can begin to quantify those and I hope that they will be welcomed by members across the chamber.</p><p>We should all support the initiative. The ambition and vision of the innovation centre programme is remarkable. I hope that the whole chamber will wish the partners every success over the coming months, years and decades as we work together to ensure an innovative, collaborative, independent Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Innovation Centres (Economic Impact)"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>There was little that was surprising in those questions, but I am grateful that Neil Bibby welcomed the investment and the excellent work that is being done across the country.</p><p>I pay tribute to the work of academics for yes, which has very successfully&#8212;[Interruption.] I am sorry to hear Labour members jeering.

How dare Scotland vote to end poverty and create a fairer nation for rural and urban Scots alike?</p><p>It was ever thus. When the radical young Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham MP was arguing about Scottish home rule in the House of Commons in 1889, he suggested that the demand came not from any sentimental ground whatever, but</p><p>&#8220;from the extreme misery of a certain section of the Scottish population, and they wish to have their own Members under their own hands, in order to extort legislation from them suitable to relieve that misery.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, House of Commons, 9 April 1889; Vol 335, c 97.]</p><p>In 2004, I commented that</p><p>&#8220;Over a century later that misery takes startlingly similar forms, such as lack of steady work, poor health, shortage of decent housing, serial misuse of our land and sea resources and yet more unwanted wars.&#8221;</p><p>Just yesterday, the poverty and social inclusion project confirmed that that misery continues. The director of Poverty Alliance, Peter Kelly, has said:</p><p>&#8220;It should not be the case that, in 21st century Scotland, one in four adults has skimped on their own food to ensure others in the household eat. The fact that 30,000 children in Scotland live in families who cannot afford to feed them properly is a national disgrace.&#8221;</p><p>Today, food banks are the mark of misery from Wick to Wigtownshire. That shows that fair sharing of our resources does not exist.</p><p>For example, half of rural Scotland is in the hands of about 430 people. In response, the land reform review group&#8217;s report &#8220;The Land of Scotland and the Common Good&#8221; shows how to end speculation on our land and how to put that land into the hands of our people in order to feed and house us and to sustain the nation. Land reform has progressed, in part, under devolution, but independence is needed if we are to control tax avoidance and property trusts that are based in tax havens, and we need tax powers to incentivise better land use. Those powers are conspicuously absent from the unionists&#8217; list of &#8220;more powers&#8221; that will be transferred if we vote no. Westminster has never shown the slightest wish to relinquish tax powers that are fundamental to our most basic needs and resources.</p><p>What about food production? The scandal of the common agricultural policy settlement that was brokered by the UK in Europe shows how limited Scotland&#8217;s devolved powers are. Scotland gets a lower average rate of subsidy per hectare than any other member state in Europe, and a lower rate than the rest of the UK itself gets in basic payments. The same goes for rural development. Scots farmers and crofters will lose &#8364;1&#160;billion before 2020 because we are not at the top table.</p><p>Despite that, under the SNP Government, Scotland&#8217;s food and drink sector has produced the third-highest per capita output in Europe, with only Iceland and Ireland ahead of us. With independence, we can fully promote our food and drink overseas and properly resource export certificates, unlike the UK&#8217;s dilatory bureaucracy.</p><p>Clean energy is key for rural and island Scotland, and our renewables already meet almost half of Scotland&#8217;s electricity demand. Our output has more than doubled since 2007 and the aim is to banish fuel poverty, which is one of the three major markers of deprivation, and which is hitting old rural housing hardest. The renewables industry has wide general public support. Despite the scare stories of the better together campaign, between January 2010 and April 2013 the industry announced &#163;13.1&#160;billion of investment promising 9,100 renewables jobs across Scotland. That will benefit local contractors, shops and hotels and will build our economic resilience.</p><p>Westminster, unlike the Scottish Government, is gung-ho for fracking and offers a huge support package for new nuclear power at Hinkley Point. With a no vote, would it try to dump the waste in Scotland?</p><p>With Scotland&#8217;s energy wealth, consumers should not face rising prices, the misery of fuel poverty and the risk that our renewable energy ambitions will be thwarted. We need a smoothly functioning energy market. We need Westminster to listen to and join with us, rather than to ignore us. Underinvestment in energy generation over decades has led to a looming security-of-supply crisis, most of all in England. Off the shores of my constituency in the Pentland Firth we have infinite tidal power.

I am a member of the Soil Association, Slow Food Scotland and the Scottish Crofting Federation. I am happy to thank Angus MacDonald, who deserves every credit for securing this timely debate. There are many things to be said about the bee crisis.</p><p>There has been a decline of perhaps more than 60 per cent in pollinators&#8212;bees, moths, butterflies, hoverflies and many other invertebrates. The bumblebee population alone has declined by more than 60 per cent in the past 50 years&#8212;the black bee in Scotland is a bumblebee, not a hive bee. That statistic cannot be repeated often enough if we are to wake up to multiple causes of the problem and seek long-lasting solutions that restore pollinator diversity.</p><p>The causes are multifactoral. Hedges have been grubbed up, robbing land of its wildflower margins and its blossoms, hawthorns, geans and nesting sites. That has disrupted pollinator corridors. The impacts of climate change and agricultural intensification are increasing. Invasive non-native species, pesticides, bee diseases and the varroa mite have also taken their toll, as members said.</p><p>A fortnight ago, I met Robin Inglis, who is secretary of the Olrig and District Beekeepers Association, in Caithness. He was dismayed by the arrival of varroa mite in Halkirk, near Thurso. The disease has taken 20 years to spread across Europe, and I have been monitoring it for more than 15 years as beekeepers from further south have rashly imported bees to the Highlands from infected hives. Robin Inglis stresses that the Scottish Government&#8217;s bee health programme is welcome and that the free tests that are available from the science and advice for Scottish agriculture division in Edinburgh help beekeepers to plan and reduce the impact of the disease, which is only one of the many that they encounter. On 25 July, the John O&#8217;Groat Journal reported that 2,000 varroa mites can kill a colony of 30,000 honey bees. That is how serious the problem is.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee has discussed the threat to honey bees from the neonicotinoids that have decimated bumblebees and led to the EU directive placing a two-year ban on their use, including in oil-seed rape. International scientific evidence suggests that integrated pest management plans and an extended ban on neonicotinoids are essential. The UK guidance was skewed by the anti-EU stance of the previous UK agriculture secretary, Owen Paterson, who claimed that field trials would be needed to verify the European Food Safety Authority ruling. However, mounting international evidence needs to be applied soon.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s precautionary principle has been influenced by the NFUS and its call for field trials. I note that the NFUS suggested in its briefing that unrealistically high doses of plant protection products had been applied in lab tests. However, an article in The Guardian on 7 August on food self-sufficiency pointed out that</p><p>&#8220;Yields of wheat and oil seed rape, for example, have flatlined since 1998&#8221;.</p><p>It is interesting to note that neonicotinoids were introduced in 1995. They do not seem to have helped to increase the yield of oil-seed rape. Indeed, in some areas, oil-seed rape, like other cooking oils, is produced without the use of neonicotinoids. For example, Robert Mackenzie of Cullisse in Easter Ross produces award-winning oil-seed rape oil without them.</p><p>The need for integrated management plans to protect pollinators has never been more urgent. The Scottish Government&#8217;s moves in that direction are widely welcomed and the science has been applied so that farmers and the wider community can have peace of mind. The NFUS has said that it would</p><p>&#8220;welcome any further opportunity to work with stakeholders including scientists, regulators, beekeepers and environmental NGOs in order to ensure that Scottish farming and bees can co-exist in a sustainable manner.&#8221;</p><p>In order to end the threat to bees in Scotland and solve the problem of pollinator decline, we need to promote scientific research as soon as possible in greater amounts in our outstanding colleges and institutes.

I will concentrate on some of the aspects of festivals that go on from year to year&#8212;in particular, those in my part of the world.</p><p>The large and small festivals throughout the country are the backbone of the festival movement. If we are lucky, we can rely on them taking place if the funding can be found through the systems that exist to pay for part of their existence. I make a plea to Creative Scotland to ensure that it does not always seek new ways to spend money but that it recognises that having festivals from one year to the next is in itself a creative activity.</p><p>I want to talk about the f&#232;isean, the festivals that promote the Gaelic language. About 13,000 young people participate each year, with another 4,800 taking part in the youth music initiative that is organised. Benefits for Gaelic culture and history flow from the festivals.</p><p>After 10 years of the f&#232;is movement, a report by Comedia in 1996 pointed out, in the case of the adult f&#232;is, which takes place in May in Ullapool, that</p><p>&#8220;the f&#232;isean make a hugely valuable contribution to their communities at very little public expense&#8221;.</p><p>It cited the example that, in 1996, the f&#232;isean provided a considerable amount of year round activity for</p><p>&#8220;less than half the public subsidy allocated, without hesitation, to a single swimming pool and sports hall in Ullapool.&#8221;</p><p>In other words, many very valuable&#8212;and growing&#8212;cultural events are supported with a lot less money than many other events are.</p><p>We must remember that F&#232;isean nan G&#224;idheal is increasing its reach around many parts of the country. A 2001 Highlands and Islands Enterprise report stated:</p><p>&#8220;The original vision of a community-led festival that passes on the skills of traditional music, song and dance, has developed into a highly effective network of volunteers, tutors and supporting organisations with centres of activity across most parts of Scotland where there are active Gaelic communities.&#8221;</p><p>That is a tremendous volunteer-led effort, which has public recognition and which contributes to some of the widespread festivals that I have mentioned.</p><p>I turn to another very important aspect of festivals. I congratulate the cultural festivals of the Commonwealth games. Last night, Jim Sutherland and Fiona Mackenzie presented a smidgeon of the struileag show. As they said, Gaelic used to be spoken all over Scotland and its speakers&#8217; descendants are spread across the world.</p><p>&#8220;This scattering of people is the Scottish Gaelic diaspora. Struileag/Shore to Shore is mapping the farthest reaches of this amazing diaspora, connecting with people who feel the call of a culture that is etched into their DNA.&#8221;</p><p>The show, &#8220;Children of The Smoke&#8221;, was presented in Glasgow. That major element of creativity arose from the call to ensure that we had a vibrant cultural outpouring at the same time as the sports activities. Jim Sutherland, its creator, must be hugely thanked for creating that opportunity in festival 2014. We must ask about supporting future performances, so that many other people can see the show, too.</p><p>It is in that context that we must draw support. In June 2013, Fiona Hyslop, when speaking at the Talbot Rice gallery in the University of Edinburgh, said:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland&#8217;s cultural life and heritage cannot be reduced to a single style or image; rather, they are a wealth of what we might describe as &#8216;stories&#8217; that take many different forms, as diverse as the land, peoples and places of this complex country.&#8221;</p><p>When one builds on that vision, one must ensure that culture&#8212;in all its forms&#8212;is supported by our Government. It must be recognised that that can happen not only when one has the powers to promote it, but when one has the money to make the best of those cultural outpourings that are as innate in our people as they are in the peoples of every other country in the world.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p></p><p>2.

Community Land Scotland&#8217;s vision of a fair and equitable distribution of Scottish land chimes well with the final report of the land reform review group&#8212;&#8220;The Land of Scotland and the Common Good&#8221;&#8212;which shows that land reform cannot be achieved with one simple formula but is incremental, as each tranche adds to the application of the public interest test to all the land issues that we face today.</p><p>In my large constituency, there are examples that show the need for flexibility of approach. For instance, at Leckmelm, a formerly larger family estate of about 6,000 acres that saw much of its hill ground sold off on the death of the father of the present owner, the current owner is now seeking to enlist the support of Ullapool Community Trust to see whether the community would be interested in purchasing hill ground of some 5,000 acres that is again on the market. The community trust put out a questionnaire in the Ullapool News a fortnight ago to see what local people think. The motives of the Beattie family at Leckmelm are understandable as they work on many community projects and have strong local support year in, year out.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Dutch company that bought the nearby Foich estate of some 23,000 acres in the 1970s added that at Inverlael, which is closer to Leckmelm, in 1994 and bought Tir Aluinn, the former hotel at Leckmelm, in 2002. It has the ability to buy land in such quantities in Scotland. The international lesson is: why here, but not in Holland? Now it wants to add the Leckmelm hill ground to its extensive estate, not for cattle and sheep or for community uses but merely for the occasional sporting slaughter of deer.</p><p>Scottish Land &amp; Estates is always saying that it wants collaboration with local people, and Community Land Scotland has an excellent track record where communities have bought land outright. However, the Leckmelm example is one where the common good needs the land laws to be made more open to community participation. The situation is all the more significant as Leckmelm witnessed the forcible removal of the crofters on the estate by the then owner in 1880, which was one of the triggers for the creation of the Highland Land League and for the crofters war. We need better solutions today.</p><p>The Bunchrew declaration encourages us to see land reform questions as a normal part of a nation&#8217;s development. As Scotland debates its land reform issues, other countries around the world are facing up to challenging land questions, too, and they need to interact.</p><p>A parallel guide is the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to make Scotland a hydro nation. It states:</p><p>&#8220;Water is of fundamental importance for Scotland&#8217;s economy, health, social wellbeing and environment. All businesses rely on the water environment in some way or another and water plays a prominent role in the success of many sectors of the economy. Some are of strategic importance to Scotland&#8217;s economy, such as tourism, food and drinks manufacturing and renewable energy generation.&#8221;</p><p>It is absolutely the same with land, or even more so.</p><p>We can learn from many other countries about best practice on land reform.

Our country needs so much more.&#8221;</p><p>It does, indeed, need &#8220;so much more&#8221;, and we must highlight ideas about independence and taxation that make it clear how we can support our public services. I want to mention several such ideas.</p><p>I note that, in these days of new Labour and its followers, the Jimmy Reid Foundation has produced a document entitled &#8220;Investing in the Good Society: five questions on tax and the Common Weal&#8221;, which highlights a number of measures that are carried out in a moderate way in many northern European countries. It suggests, for example, that wages should be higher, because they bring in higher taxes, and that tax evasion should be reduced. Is it easier for a small country to tackle that issue than it is for the UK? We need look only at the success of HM Revenue and Customs and ask ourselves whether we could do worse.</p><p>The Jimmy Reid Foundation paper also suggests that we should generate new taxes and income from wealth, land and property. In that respect, we should think about the current offer to devolve tax. With regard to the rural economy, which I deal with, the Scottish Affairs Committee in London has said that although we need land reform, it does not think that it can convince the UK Government that it needs to end tax evasion and stop tax havens. In fact, it argues that that is just not a possibility in the present circumstances. Labour is silent on the issues. When it talks about land reform, it is an empty coat.</p><p>The Jimmy Reid Foundation document also talks about generating greater income from Scotland&#8217;s natural resources. We need look only at how our natural energy resources have been mismanaged to realise that we can get more money from them and more tax from development of those industries&#8212;money and taxes that have been denied us under the current situation.

Fifty years of the Scottish Wildlife Trust is well worth celebrating, by the volunteers who work in it and by the wider public, because of the fantastic work that the trust has done.</p><p>I will mention a couple of items in particular. I have been involved in SWT&#8217;s bringing to our attention the policy problems that exist in our landscape. In my constituency, there are three reserves. I will mention two in particular; I hope that I will visit the third one this summer, although I pass through it often.</p><p>The first is Handa island, which belongs to the Scourie estate and is managed by the SWT. It was like a Robinson Crusoe island on the day that I and my colleague George Farlow visited it with Maggie Keegan. We could see the great skuas sitting about 10m away in the heather&#8212;and all the other birds&#8212;on a beautiful summer day.</p><p>It is important to ensure that people can visit and study in that area, which means that there is expense in making sure that the facilities are up to scratch: there must be modern toilets, meeting places and so on so that the summer residents can make sure that visitors get the best experience. The trust is interested in the biodiversity argument, as well as in ensuring that people get the chance to experience the island and benefit from it.</p><p>I was interested in the discussions about the national planning framework. One of the points that the SWT made in its briefing at that time was about getting children who have severe attention deficit disorder involved in nature. It gave us a quote from Richard Louv, the author of &#8220;Last Child in the Woods&#8221;, who said:</p><p>&#8220;Time in nature is not leisure time; it&#8217;s an essential investment in our children&#8217;s health&#8221;</p><p>and also, by the way, in our own. The hallmark of the SWT&#8217;s activities is precious indeed.</p><p>Biodiversity issues have been mentioned, particularly by Claudia Beamish. As my previous example shows, the trust has thought about the human aspects of the landscape.</p><p>The second area that I want to talk about is the Coigach-Assynt living landscape&#8212;CALL&#8212;project, which is a landscape-scale project with a 50-year time horizon. It allows us to think about not only the regeneration of biodiversity but the place that humans have in that, in the hope that we can have more people living in those areas, and that they can live sustainably.</p><p>At the Achiltibuie end, in Coigach, in the largest area of land that the trust owns, it has been able to support the local community. The community sought to use wind power to support local activities, and the trust saw no difficulty in supporting that, because it realised that, if there is to be a means to look after the whole area and its natural beauty and biodiversity, the local population must be able to sustain itself. That recognition of the symbiotic relationship between nature and people is one of the highlights of the Scottish Wildlife Trust.</p><p>I thank Allan Bantick for being the chair in a momentous period and the officers who support him, and I wish Robin Harper, the incoming chair, all the best for many years to come.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Wildlife Trust (50th Anniversary)"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13993.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13993", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Rob Gibson", "member_id": "80429", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Caithness, Sutherland and Ross"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Rob", "last_name": "Gibson", "left_house": "2011-03-23", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13993.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13993", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Rob Gibson", "member_id": "80314", "entered_house": "2007-05-03", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Highlands and Islands"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Rob", "last_name": "Gibson", "left_house": "2007-04-02", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13993.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13993", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Rob Gibson", "member_id": "80036", "entered_house": "2003-05-01", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Highlands and Islands"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Fergus", "last_name": "Ewing", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>Recent reports illustrate the important role that innovation and new technological solutions can play in achieving significant cost savings for the industry, boosting production and ultimately increasing tax revenue from North Sea oil and gas extraction.</p><p>With the powers of independence, the Scottish Government would be able to ensure that North Sea revenues are used to provide long-term benefit to the Scottish people instead of being squandered by Westminster Governments as in the past.

I am also very grateful for the contributions of all members from different parties across the chamber. They recognise the significant role that independent retailers play in the economy; it is a very large role.</p><p>The retail sector has been quite resilient during the recession. It did not go &#8220;down the stank&#8221;, to use the technical expression that Mr Gibson brought to the proceedings; rather, it managed to overcome very well the buffeting of the recession. I am quite sure that that is partly because of the hard work and effort that managers and owners of those independent businesses brought to bear to ensure that they offer an efficient, friendly and effective service that provides goods, fresh food and a variety of grocery products that people throughout the country want. They give people what they want and run the businesses well on a family basis. I used to be one of them, as opposed to a politician&#8212;although I suppose that a politician is one of them, as well, in a different context.</p><p>I was a small businessperson and I remember the pleasures and anxieties of running a business. Being responsible for the livelihoods of a great many other people is a burden to bear, but that is a burden that independent retailers bear extremely well in Scotland, as the figures show. As has been pointed out, employment in the sector is substantial.</p><p>There are challenges facing all businesses in Scotland. The burden of taxation is one such challenge. Various members, starting with Gordon MacDonald, mentioned business rates, and that was a particular focus of Gavin Brown&#8217;s speech. We are pleased that we reinstated the uniform business rate in 2008, the year after we came into office. That ended an extra overtaxation of, I think, up to 8 or 9 per cent, and the change has made a contribution. I am also very pleased that we have had a measure of cross-party support for the introduction of the small business bonus scheme, which assists more than 92,000 businesses&#8212;two in five premises.</p><p>Gavin Brown puts his points reasonably. As he suggests, we want to do more&#8212;there is no question about that. That applies across the board, because business rates are a significant burden for a great many businesses. The rate must be paid irrespective of turnover. The sum is fixed and is based on the notional rental or the rateable value. The rate is a large and looming burden in running a business.</p><p>I say out of fairness and to be candid, particularly given that we know that some independent retailers are in the gallery, that I would be somewhat pleasantly surprised if they were eligible for the small business scheme. That is because the bonus is for the smallest businesses.</p><p>Mr Brown asked whether we could raise the thresholds and whether those thresholds could be stepped. On 11 December 2013, John Swinney announced an expansion of the small business bonus scheme by increasing the upper threshold for businesses with multiple properties from &#163;25,000 to &#163;35,000. That expansion was estimated to extend the benefit to more than 4,000 additional properties over this Parliament&#8217;s lifetime.</p><p>We also have more generous provision with regard to empty property relief than is available south of the border. Derek Mackay, the Minister for Local Government and Planning, has introduced a new incentive&#8212;the fresh start relief, which provides a 50 per cent rate of relief for 12 months when long-term empty property such as shops and offices become newly occupied. That would perhaps affect only a small number of businesses; nonetheless, it is there to encourage and promote additional economic activity in the retail sector.</p><p>Reference was made to regulations and red tape. The Scottish Government brought in the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Act 2014, which I led on, and which will make all public bodies subject to the duty of considering the economic impact of what they do. That general principle is one whose introduction was long overdue. The duty is not yet in force, but we expect regulators in particular to act as though it were. Therefore, when taking decisions, public bodies must take account of the economic impact&#8212;how they affect existing business&#8212;and seek to ascertain how decisions that they take will affect businesses.</p><p>On town centre planning, in July my colleague Derek Mackay, along with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, announced the town centre first principle. Reflecting some of Gordon MacDonald&#8217;s remarks about supermarkets, the recognition of that principle acknowledges that, in some town centres, matters are very difficult. There are empty shops, a great number of charity shops and perhaps a lack of choice to individuals in many towns throughout the country. I will not name them, but that is a tendency that we have noticed. Therefore, the town centre first principle is a recognition that we need to redress the balance against the dominance of the supermarkets, as was mentioned by a great many members.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch mentioned new initiatives. We have the small business bonus scheme, the empty property relief and the fresh start property relief. We also have the business improvement districts and the town centre first principle. In one sense, I suspect that most people in business here, those are, in practical day-to-day terms, probably not of much relevance. Also, people in business do not expect or want Government to come along with an occasional cheque, bung or grant. They do not want initiatives with handouts. I am sure that that was not what was suggested. Rather, they expect to run profitably, to run the show themselves and to offer a good service to their customers and thereby make a decent living, and to look after their staff well and provide appropriate training for them.</p><p>However, we in the Scottish Government are of course very keen to work with the representative bodies that have been referenced, including the Scottish Grocers Federation, representatives of newsagents and the Scottish Retail Consortium. Like my colleagues, I seek to have close relations with those bodies, and I will continue to do that.</p><p>To the independent retailers and their sector in general, I say that I have worked with individual businesses, not least in my constituency, to help them to access other services so that they can, for example, become a post office or retain their lottery ticket outlet, and so on. However, if there are general matters, initiatives or measures that are identified by independent retailers as creating barriers to success, I would be extremely happy to work with their representatives on that. I am grateful that Mr MacDonald has given me the opportunity clearly to make that pledge. I also support the initiatives that have been taken by the Scottish Grocers Federation recently in terms of healthy living and healthy food, which we very much welcome.</p><p>We have covered quite a wide range of topics this evening, but I think that what is most important is that all of us, across the different parties, expressed our support for and appreciation of the economic, practical and, as Margaret McCulloch said, social functions that smaller independent shops provide as they compete with the megaliths of the dominant supermarkets with their different practices, including purchasing practices. The smaller shops find it difficult from time to time to compete with them in those ways. However, by their personal, local, effective, high-quality service they have nonetheless proved to be very resilient in hard times.

It is a role that was performed in the previous Parliament by my good friend and former fellow Highlands and Islands MSP Peter Peacock, who seemed to delight in standing up for invertebrates, as he said. He almost became his party&#8217;s spokesman for the birds and the bees and I think that he would unequivocally have welcomed the bee hives in the parliamentary complex, although he would probably have drawn the line at volunteering to artificially inseminate any of them.</p><p>On the importance of bumblebees, honey bees and other pollinating inspects, I recall that in the debate that we had on this issue in 2009 we heard fairly striking figures. Some 84 per cent of EU crops are pollinated by insects, 80 per cent of wild flowers depend on insect pollination and two out of every three mouthfuls of food that we eat come from plants pollinated by all pollinating insects, which is even more than Angus MacDonald suggested.</p><p>Therefore, the fact that numbers have dropped so dramatically&#8212;I think that the figure is around 60 per cent for the bumblebee population over the past 50 years&#8212;matters a great deal. It matters economically, as members said, and it matters environmentally&#8212;Alison Johnstone reminded us of the need to maintain biodiversity. It should therefore matter politically, and if further persuasion is needed on that, I point to the mention in SWT&#8217;s briefing of a YouGov poll that found that 85 per cent of people put the issue right at the top of the environmental agenda.</p><p>The decline in bee numbers is not unique to Scotland or the UK. It appears to be a worldwide phenomenon. The reasons for the decline are complex and include the loss of floral diversity and nesting habitat, climate change, the presence of invasive non-native species, intensive farming practices and the impact of pesticides. Like other members, I welcome the ban on neonics over the next two years. There is an argument for going further, but in the meantime the rules on sustainable use of pesticides and the guidance on integrated pest management are welcome steps forward.</p><p>The two-year ban also presents an opportunity for research into alternative practices. I would be interested to hear from the minister what might be achieved through the new CAP rules in relation to greening requirements and agri-environment schemes&#8212;she might ask her ministerial colleague to write to us on that in due course. Research is an area in which Scotland can probably punch above its weight, through the Moredun Research Institute and the James Hutton Institute. I understand that researchers at Newcastle University are looking at ways of bringing together natural toxin from spider venom and plant protein to produce an insect-specific pesticide. Excellent research is going on.</p><p>I was struck by a couple of initiatives to which the SWT referred. The SWT&#8217;s flying flock of sheep and herd of cattle, which are used to lightly graze trust reserves and thereby help to maintain habitat, conjure up all kinds of images&#8212;there is no sign yet of a flying litter of pigs. The trust runs demonstrations on gardening for wildlife. We all have a role to play in that regard, and with all due modesty I will claim some success, given the explosion of rampant nettles, thistles and other assorted plants in the land around my house, which has created a number of no-go zones for humans but a haven for bees.</p><p>Orkney is fortunate to be one of the few parts of the UK that can still lay claim to having great yellow bumblebees in some numbers, but bee populations in Orkney are under threat. The honey bee population is under threat from the varroa mite. The minister will know from experience in her previous role that the protection that was afforded previously by the islands&#8217; not having statutory infected area status has been lost, but I still think that the Pentland Firth is an ideal barrier to a variety of animal and insect diseases and that even a voluntary ban on the import of hives and bees could mean that the destruction caused by the varroa mite and other diseases is less of a problem in future, although such an approach will not be easy. I hope that the minister will encourage her colleagues to take the matter forward.</p><p>I congratulate Angus MacDonald on securing the debate and giving us a bit of a breather from matters constitutional. Einstein is supposed to have said that if the bees go, mankind will follow within four years, which perhaps puts into perspective our deliberations on our constitutional future.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Pollinator Population"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>For a moment, I thought that I was about to be thrown out with the Willie Coffey bath water.</p><p>I certainly welcome the debate and whole-heartedly support the motion and, indeed, Labour&#8217;s amendment. In fact, the debate is quite a welcome antidote to the debate on welfare that I sat through yesterday.</p><p>I give due warning that I will concentrate most of my remarks on the excellence and vibrancy of what is going on in my constituency&#8212;in Orkney&#8212;and, like other members, make no apology for doing so. I will touch on some of the themes that I raised during the recent youth arts strategy debate.</p><p>I pay tribute&#8212;as Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s amendment does&#8212;to what is being achieved in the capital, notably by Festivals Edinburgh. It is truly a world-class celebration of culture that demonstrates its intrinsic value, as Liz Smith pointed out. The variety is truly astonishing, and that is a fitting legacy from Sir Jonathan Mills, to whom others have referred.</p><p>Despite that intrinsic value, we should not be embarrassed in any way by the economic value of the festivals. Edinburgh is testimony to the extent to which culture and festivals drive tourism and generate economic benefit directly, but also by providing the sorts of places in which people want to live and work. By extension, economic benefit is delivered in that way.</p><p>It is unusual for us to be here in Edinburgh during August. It is not, as colleagues may be surprised to learn, all upside. Nevertheless, it gives those of us who travel from further afield a first opportunity to attend the festival of politics this weekend, and also to immerse ourselves a bit in the festival and fringe that are going on at the moment.</p><p>Those who know me will know that I am no expert or necessarily aficionado of modern dance; nevertheless, earlier this week, I found myself at a production by Black Grace, a New Zealand dance group with Samoan roots, which produced something that was truly exhilarating. The cabinet secretary suggested that everybody can dance. If I had tried half the moves that the dancers made, I would be in traction. However, I put on the record my thanks to Creative New Zealand for its efforts in supporting Black Grace and a number of other New Zealand artists who are present in the festival. They enrich the experience for all of us.</p><p>My conversion to modern dance theatre can be attributed to the powers of persuasion of fringe chief executive, the oft-quoted Kath Mainland. As Colin Keir suggested, her CBE is richly merited and is recognition of her achievements in building on the success of the fringe. I congratulate her and her remarkable team on what looks set to be another record-breaking season for the fringe.</p><p>It is no surprise, of course, that Kath is a native Orcadian. I recognise that it is not a competition, but surely few places can lay claim to the range and quality of festivals that take place each year in the islands that I represent. Like Edinburgh&#8217;s, Orkney&#8217;s calendar is packed almost throughout the year. In the one-act play festival in February, Orkney groups reached the national finals in both the adult and youth categories, and there is real excitement that Orkney arts theatre will play host to the Scottish finals next year. That is a reward for the hard work that has been put in by far too many people to mention, and it is also recognition of the healthy state of drama in the islands.</p><p>We move on to the Orkney folk festival, which is internationally renowned, as the cabinet secretary kindly acknowledged. It attracts acts from all over the world, but it is firmly rooted in the folk music traditions of Orkney. Stromness was again alive with the sound of music from every bar and hall spilling out into the street. It really was a wonderful atmosphere. I declare an interest as the brother of somebody who is integral to organising the festival, but it has been particularly gratifying to see the number of young acts in recent years who have gone on to star at Celtic Connections and other festivals in Scotland, in the UK and further afield.</p><p>The St Magnus international festival in June similarly enjoys an international reputation, blending quality and variety exceptionally well while also taking steps to engage with the wider community through concerts in the smaller isles and rural parishes and workshops in schools.</p><p>Agricultural shows then take centre stage for a couple of months before the science festival gets under way at the beginning of September. It is a truly eclectic mix of talks, workshops, concerts and gatherings of every conceivable sort based, often rather loosely, around particular scientific themes. There is something for everyone, as the organiser Howie Firth observes, and, quite rightly in my mind, it is one of the small number of festivals that receives support through Government funding.</p><p>If I may, I will start the process of post-referendum peace and reconciliation by inviting the cabinet secretary up to Orkney again for the Orkney blues festival. It runs from 19 to 21 September and, perhaps even more than the festival that Sarah Boyack mentioned, it may be an ideal opportunity to harness the cabinet secretary&#8217;s mood at that time.</p><p>As the nights close in, we settle down for Orkney&#8217;s storytelling festival at the end of October.</p><p>Given that array of festivals, as well as the wider cultural and artistic activity that takes place in Orkney during the year, I was delighted but not surprised to hear earlier this week that a two-day creative Orkney event is planned for the end of September. It will be hosted by the centre for Nordic studies and is a celebration of Orkney&#8217;s vibrant cultural and creative scene. It will include everything from field trips round neolithic Orkney and tours of the Pier Arts Centre to jewellery workshops and a discussion on the work of photojournalist Gunnie Moberg, whose photos have adorned the walls in this Parliament.</p><p>That is all positive, but I will sound a slightly discordant note before I conclude. Those festivals thrive&#8212;and perhaps only survive&#8212;by being able to attract visitors to the islands. It is therefore disappointing that such significant cuts were made to the lifeline ferry services across the Pentland Firth under the current contract, which was negotiated by the Government. I know that some sailings have been put back this year to coincide with the year of homecoming but, if we are really to be successful in growing the festivals, extending the shoulders of the tourist season and capitalising on the wider economic opportunities, ministers need to review the decision.</p><p>I very much welcome this debate. I acknowledge the wonderful story that Orkney and indeed Scotland have to tell with regard to our festivals&#8212;in this year, perhaps, more than ever before&#8212;and I look forward to seeing a number of colleagues at the festival of politics in the Parliament over the weekend.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>I welcome this, the latest debate on welfare, which is an issue of fundamental importance to people right across the country.</p><p>I declare a personal interest as someone whose brother has been a long-term recipient of disability living allowance.

That approach will need to continue, but the UK Government does not seek to shy away from the need for radical reform&#8212;and that need for reform is something that is accepted by most independent experts and all political parties, including, it would seem, the SNP. Little wonder, given the reality that the system too often provides the wrong incentives. For too many people, it acts as a real obstacle to work. Over the period when our economy experienced almost uninterrupted growth, the welfare budget increased in real terms by around 40 per cent. That does not make sense, and it is not sustainable.</p><p>Of course, the debate is not really about welfare. As ever, as the Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities admitted, it is all about the referendum and the belief that all would miraculously be better with independence. For the reasons that I set out at the start of my speech, and in the interests of those who are worried, I may be tempted to take the SNP&#8217;s promises at face value, but those assertions need to be rigorously tested, which is what Jackie Baillie, Alex Johnstone and Ken Macintosh did.</p><p>Let us start with the case for reform. The cabinet secretary denounces everyone else for supporting reform, but it is an agenda that she and her colleagues appear to accept&#8212;why else set up the expert working group? The challenge facing the group was not insignificant. Its members were presumably tasked with coming forward with proposals that would honour Ms Sturgeon&#8217;s commitment to a welfare system that was &#8220;fairer and simpler&#8221;, that would &#8220;make work pay&#8221;, that was &#8220;innovative&#8221;, that included &#8220;appropriate targeting&#8221; and that did not involve cuts, but which would not have the &#163;2.5 billion needed to honour the promises made by SNP ministers in opposing almost every change put forward by the UK Government.</p><p>How did the group do? In truth, it did as well as could be expected. However, after months of listening to SNP ministers and back benchers rail against the work programme, sanctions and even universal credit, we find that their experts are recommending&#8212;to the surprise of no one&#8212;a work programme, sanctions and the principle of universal credit.</p><p>Simply changing the name of those UK policies to pretend that somehow what one is proposing is radically different is disingenuous and will leave many more people across Scotland wondering what the point of independence is.</p><p>As for the criticism of welfare caps and the threat of more cuts to come, the SNP&#8217;s case is little more convincing. The First Minister himself has said that</p><p>&#8220;the right cap deployed in the right way ... is a reasonable thing to have&#8221;.</p><p>As far as Mr Salmond is concerned, the cap appears to fit.</p><p>Meanwhile, the SNP&#8217;s own fiscal commission has said that the Scottish Government will have to match the trajectory on debt reduction, and Mr Swinney agrees. It is little wonder, then, that the white paper makes no mention of any commitment to increase spending by the &#163;2.5 billion that would be needed to make good on the promises that the SNP regularly makes to reverse the cuts, which&#8212;let us be clear&#8212;are represented in Scotland by a welfare budget that is, for the time being, going up. By all accounts, the cabinet secretary could not shed any more light on that at yesterday&#8217;s meeting of the Welfare Reform Committee.</p><p>There does not even seem to be space in the white paper to explain how the SNP would pay for another of its top priorities&#8212;one that is backed by a motion of this Parliament&#8212;to increase child benefit for those who earn more than &#163;60,000 a year. Therefore, the SNP&#8217;s claims on welfare do not stack up.</p><p>Meanwhile, we have the ridiculous claim that only a yes vote next month will save the NHS. What arrant nonsense. Since 2010, NHS funding in England has gone up by &#163;12.7 billion. The cash equivalent for Scotland is protected and can be spent by the Scottish Government in any way it sees fit. In addition, the founding principles of treatment being free at the point of delivery and based on clinical need are unique and enduring.</p><p>By contrast, as the IFS and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland have both pointed out, the costs of independence would lead to tax hikes and/or spending cuts, which would inevitably affect the NHS in Scotland, as John Swinney agreed in his infamous briefing to Cabinet. It is no wonder that today&#8217;s British Medical Journal poll suggests that 60 per cent of doctors believe that we get the best of both worlds as part of the UK.</p><p>On welfare, after three years of debates and much sound and fury, we know what the SNP does not like but, as Ken Macintosh rightly observed, what is not clear is how any of that would change in the event of Scotland leaving the UK or how any changes would be paid for&#8212;or, indeed, in what currency. Simply rebranding key elements of what has been introduced by the UK Government while promising to reverse other changes but failing to say how much that would cost or how it would be paid for will not wash.</p><p>We need to create a welfare system that is simple to understand, that lifts people out of poverty and that makes work pay while at the same time providing an effective safety net for those who need it. However, as I have said previously, claiming to be in favour of reform while holding the view that any cuts to any benefits or any tightening of any of the demands that are placed on recipients is automatically unfair just is not credible.</p><p>No party in the Parliament, including the SNP, has a monopoly on caring, but the SNP scaremongering about the NHS or further welfare cuts while making promises that it knows it cannot keep will not provide a more secure future for the people who need support.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>Professor Dunleavy estimates the cost at &#163;200 million if, among other things, command and control of defence forces is shared with the UK until 2020.

We need to ensure that there is legal certainty and that safeguarding and promoting the historic environment does not suffer in comparison with other Government priorities through a lack of specific reference in the bill that will establishes HES.</p><p>The Law Society of Scotland made useful comments on the functions of HES and drew attention to the fact that there is no function of promoting the maintenance of the historic environment. The society suggested that that function needs to be more explicitly stated in the bill.

In particular, the critical relationship will be between HES and local authorities. Again, the bill might need to be strengthened in that respect at stage 2. A key message that came out of the visit to Orkney was on the division of responsibility between the local and the national. Rightly, my constituents were adamant that the merger to create HES should not and must not lead to a more centralised approach. Although national standards and consistent quality are vital, so too is the capacity for the organisation to respond to local circumstances and to take decisions that reflect them&#8212;as Patricia Ferguson, Liz Smith and others have said.

However, as colleagues witnessed at first hand, that charge cannot be laid against people in Orkney.

That is, of course, important for my constituency, but it is also crucial for Scotland as a whole.</p><p>I record my gratitude to the staff in Historic Scotland and the RCAHMS, notably the rangers, whom Clare Adamson mentioned.

It was, without question, a great achievement and, in judging the legacy, I suspect that much good will come of them in sporting and economic terms.</p><p>As a Shetlander, I would find it difficult not to start not just with Erraid Davies but with all three Shetland girls who made team Scotland. For Erraid to win a bronze medal in a para-swimming discipline was a fantastic success. It was so unexpected. In all the assessments that I saw, including when I asked those at the top of Scottish Swimming what they expected to happen, at no time did I see that her success was expected. That is why it is a triumph for her personally and also for her coach and family, and for all Shetland. We are all very proud of her.</p><p>We have to be equally proud of Andrea Strachan, who made the 50m final in the breaststroke. She is one of the eight fastest girls in the 50m in the Commonwealth, and that is one heck of an achievement for her, and for her coaches at the University of Edinburgh, where she is on the swim team.</p><p>I did two good things during the 10 days of the Commonwealth games. First, I spent a lot of money in the bars of Glasgow, so I did my bit to help Mr Dornan&#8217;s city&#8217;s economy, although I would rather that did not get home to Shetland.</p><p>The second good thing that I did was in response to a text message that I took from Andrea Strachan&#8217;s dad while she was swimming in the semi-final, in which he asked whether there was any chance that I could get some tickets for the final, because the family had run out. I would like to thank the people who helped to make that happen&#8212;I will not mention them all&#8212;because I was very proud to see Andrea swim in the final, but I felt even better, as a Shetlander, knowing that her whole family was there, including her grandfather and a bunch of her wider family. To see someone whom you have known for a long time swim in a final of the Commonwealth games takes a bit of beating.</p><p>Lynda Flaws was in team Scotland&#8217;s table tennis team. She is doing exams at the moment&#8212;poor soul&#8212;to get back into university in a few weeks&#8217; time, because some time ago she went to Tokyo to compete in an international table tennis event in order to make the grade and qualify for team Scotland. That worked, and we hope that her university markers look favourably on the work that she is now doing to ensure that she continues her glittering academic career. I should say that Lynda was skinning my son on a football field at the age of 10, so she is very talented at every sport, and I am sure that she will continue to be so.</p><p>The games gave us many great memories. One of my most abiding memories will be of the great support for all the home nations. I confess that I did not know so many Scots knew the words to &#8220;Jerusalem&#8221;. The night that Hannah Miley and Ross Murdoch won and Andrea Strachan qualified for the final of the 50m breaststroke, it was quite noticeable that when the English lad won an event&#8212;I forget the discipline&#8212;the place erupted in the same way. That was the experience that I had at all the events that I went to. Of course the roof came off when team Scotland won, but the support for athletes from all the home nations was astronomical. It made me very proud to be a Scot and to be part of those proceedings.</p><p>Another great memory is of the Malaysian rugby sevens team doing a lap of honour at Ibrox&#8212;I have not seen many laps of honour at Ibrox recently&#8212;at the end of the Sunday morning proceedings to say thanks to the fans, who had cheered them through defeat after defeat. The Malaysian rugby sevens players probably did more for Malaysian diplomacy than anything else that is going on at the moment. I was proud to see everyone in the stadium rise to applaud them. Selfies were taken and fun was had by lots of kids, who rushed down to the front to have their photographs taken with the hulking great rugby players. Over the two days of the competition, 170,000 people came to Ibrox, which was a world record crowd for rugby. If that competition has a legacy, it is probably that rugby sevens has come to Scotland; I should really say &#8220;come home&#8221;, because, after all, the sport started in Melrose. That was a tremendous achievement.</p><p>At Hampden, two days before I saw David Rudisha lose to the astonishing Botswanan athlete Nijel Amos in the 800m&#8212;I never thought that I would see Rudisha lose a race after he won the Olympics&#8212;I saw a Nigerian discuss thrower in the para discipline walk into the throwing ring, throw down both his crutches and, on one leg, throw the discuss 45m and come second&#8212;he won the silver medal. He did a lap of honour and, believe me, Hampden stood for that. His was an unbelievable achievement.</p><p>The decision to integrate the events for able-bodied athletes with those for competitors with disabilities was a brilliant one. Across the sports, that integration worked fantastically.</p><p>There is one legacy that I want to mention in addition to the legacies that Liz Smith rightly mentioned to do with schools and leadership, such as walking to school and participation in sport, and all the other legacies that other colleagues have rightly mentioned&#8212;a levelling of the playing field so that, regardless of where in Scotland they live, as well as being able to compete at an elite level, people can simply take part in sport. I am talking about sports clubs in my part of the world having the ability to compete against other sports clubs from across the country in their disciplines. I know that the minister is seized of the importance of that, and I thank her for her very positive response, not just on Tuesday but on other occasions. I recognise her commitment to that. For me, it would be a great legacy to ensure that, regardless of where they live in Scotland, an Erraid Davies, an Andrea Strachan, a Lynda Flaws or the Shetland rugby team can take part in competitive sport.

Indeed, from 1999 to 2007, the SNP rightly held the Government to account on exactly that issue. Mr Swinney often led the charge; he often had a point.</p><p>Gavin Brown&#8217;s sensible amendment identified the core problem in the Government&#8217;s approach to the appointments. I admire Susan Rice. I would appoint her, too, were I in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s position. However, in passing, I say that such appointments are entirely devolved, so the Government could have sought to appoint two women and a man, or even three eminent female financial experts. Had it chosen to do so, then the balance of women versus men appointed to public positions would have improved. Sadly, that will not be the case.</p><p>I do not know the other nominees but, from what I read, I share the assessment of Gavin Brown and Malcolm Chisholm that they are eminently qualified. However, that is surely not the point. Members of the commission should not be advising the Government on economic policy on the one hand and scrutinising Government forecasts on the other hand. That, by any realistic interpretation, creates a perception of a conflict of interest.</p><p>I am disappointed by not just that issue, but the commission&#8217;s remit and resources. Scotland has a highly centralised financial state. I have argued for a tartan office for budget responsibility for that reason. The UK Government got it right: it divorced economic and financial forecasting, which can be manipulated by politicians from central Government. It established the OBR. The OBR is not a friend of any UK Chancellor; it is not meant to be. The OBR provides an independent assessment of the nation&#8217;s books for not only the Government, but all representatives and policy makers, and you and me, Presiding Officer. No such emphatic independent assessment is made of the Scottish Government&#8217;s financial performance.</p><p>Scotland needs that approach. We need to judge how best to spend taxpayers&#8217; money. Consider free personal care for the elderly. Some of those who have studied the finances say that it is not affordable in its current form, while the Scottish Government says that that is not the case. Instead of such rhetoric, should decision making by ministers and the Parliament not be based on fact? A tartan OBR would provide fact unadorned by political spin and manipulation.</p><p>When Scotland gets past the autumn referendum, I would rather that the Parliament looked again at not just the appointments, but the limited, narrow and restrictive remit of the commission. I welcome Mr Swinney&#8217;s earlier remarks that he will review the remit.</p><p>By any standards, the boss of the OBR, Robert Chote, is an informative commentator. We should want the same or, indeed, better for Scotland. The finance secretary says that he does not want the commission to step on anyone&#8217;s toes, but many people outside the Parliament suspect that he is thinking about only his own feet.</p><p>I also struggle with the Government&#8217;s argument that the commission will have such a limited role that it can be lightly staffed, through a university, and can have a negligible budget. Revenue Scotland is being set up with all the panoply of the law and with resources and civil servants, even though it will administer a small number of taxes. The contrast appears to be striking.</p><p>This Parliament has not got the financial scrutiny of any Government right, not just in the past seven years, but since 1999. It is an area that is ripe for reform. The Government had a real opportunity to create a body that would deliver scrutiny and accountability across the nation&#8217;s finances. A future Scottish Government could do so much better. It could believe in healthy, robust and independent checks and balances. I would be pleased to support such an approach.</p><p>I urge the finance secretary to reconsider, to beef up his proposals and to make his appointments ones that we could all support, on a cross-party basis, because no potential for a conflict of interest would arise.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Fiscal Commission (Appointments)"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p>I thank the cabinet secretary for providing an advance copy of his statement and for the courteous cross-party discussions that he has had on the CAP regime.</p><p>I broadly welcome the transitional support, the payment regions and the island cattle payment, which will be particularly important for Orkney. Nevertheless, the cabinet secretary will share my concern over the decline in cattle and sheep numbers. Since 2004, the number of beef cattle has fallen by 13 per cent and the number of breeding sheep has fallen by 17 per cent. Does he believe that the measures that he has announced today will reverse that decline? Does the complexity of the new CAP that he has announced today&#8212;indeed, about which he has expressed concerns today&#8212;especially regarding sheep support, mean that there will be more farm inspections, sheep counts and other cross-compliance measures?

I take Mr Mason&#8217;s point about parents being darned annoyed when their kids are not at school. For some elections, we now use community halls, sports facilities and other places. However, I was not quite sure about Mr Mason&#8217;s point about buying everyone a cup of coffee before they vote. There used to be a law about treating, but I do not know whether it is still on the statute books. However, I am sure that Mr Mason was not suggesting doing something like that, and I take his point.</p><p>I hate to tell Alex Rowley this, but I was actually a Liberal Democrat when I was elected to Shetland Islands Council. However, he is absolutely right, because there are no political councillors in my part of the world at the moment, nor are there any in Orkney. However, it is a judgment call, is it not? Alex Rowley and, indeed, the minister represented their parties with great distinction at local government level, but they probably knew what they were going to achieve when they went to take policies through their councils. I have to say that, at times, my own council does not necessarily know at the start of a full council meeting what is going to happen, whether the meeting is on the school estate, funding for elderly people or whatever. I guess those are the choices that we have.</p><p>When Alex Rowley was making his observations, it struck me that another aspect is encouraging younger people to stand for election rather than just encouraging them to vote. We have the youthful Mr Mackay here, and he was a young man when he was first elected to a council. I was 27 when I was first elected to Shetland Islands Council and I was 20 years younger than anyone else in the council chamber, which I think was a shocking indictment&#8212;certainly in Shetland&#8212;of our ability to attract a younger generation to stand for election and have a role in that sense as well.</p><p>I absolutely take the point that the minister made in his introduction about the result of the European elections and what that meant. However, were we not very different in terms of how the European elections worked out? At least we kept our debate to the rights and wrongs of some of the big issues, whereas some of the parties that were elected across Europe have some pretty unpleasant sides to them. Indeed, when I look at Greece, I think that there is some trouble in store.</p><p>I observe to all my political colleagues across the parties that the only party here that really made Europe the big issue was the party that got hammered in the elections. It therefore does not automatically follow that it will do a party any good to take on the issue that is being debated in the election. However, I think that what happened to that party was because of other and different reasons rather than because it felt that the issue was about Europe.</p><p>I agree that what is important in this debate is to concentrate on what we can do to engage and encourage more people to vote at a local level. There have been many good ideas on that in the debate so far. I will give the minister three brief examples that I think are worth considering.</p><p>The first example is on John Mason&#8217;s point that the issue is not just local elections but local communities. The land reform review group published its report just the other week, and it set out a path for how local communities can have more control over their areas. That is a very different approach to the one that we have seen in recent times, to which Cameron Buchanan referred. As a member of a party that favours radical land reform and that took the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 through in the first session of the Scottish Parliament after 1999, I think that the review group&#8217;s work is important. We in this Parliament have the opportunity to help create strong and engaged local communities.</p><p>One of the other two examples for the minister is local income tax. He and I probably share the same views on that, although he is probably not allowed to say so at the moment. However, as Alex Rowley rightly said, when we get past the referendum, whatever the result, we might get back into the real, proper debate about how we fund our local councils, because they do not have financial accountability.</p><p>In truth, councils did not have a lot of financial accountability in 1999. I am not for a minute arguing that the situation was perfect then. Sarah Boyack and I shared a lot of ministerial time and she will remember a lot of the debates. To be frank, we did not make much progress in that time, but the situation has got worse since then.</p><p>Of course I do not expect Derek Mackay to agree with me on this, but I am not making a political point; I am just observing that, in a practical sense, the councillors whom I elect at home, in my part of the world, now have less financial accountability than they have ever had before. I think that all of us who come from a local government background want to see that reversed and changed. Maybe we can genuinely have that debate in the future.</p><p>My final point is on centralisation. It is important to try to make some progress on rebalancing where the powers sit. That is a live agenda for all of us. I would like our councils to have more responsibility, but that goes hand in hand with the financial accountability that I suspect we all crave.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-06-05", "body": "<p>I reinforce Richard Simpson&#8217;s point and agree with the cabinet secretary&#8217;s remarks on how important pharmacies are to GP practices.

Hubcos are managed and led by large private sector businesses&#8212;businesses that make profit and charge management fees for building a school or a health centre. However, it does not appear that the taxpayer, the Parliament or Audit Scotland know how much profit they make or what fee is levied. I suggest that that financial secrecy needs to be replaced by the financial transparency that the Deputy First Minister rightly described in her opening speech when she introduced the bill to Parliament.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s five hubcos are led by 15 main corporate businesses. Under the model, small businesses in Scotland such as builders, conveyors, construction companies and architects can only hope to be a subcontractor or a subcontractor of a subcontractor. Therefore, by definition, hubcos exclude thousands of Scottish businesses from tendering for work.</p><p>That means that the Parliament and Audit Scotland do not know whether we achieve value for money. Under the hubco model that is never tested. For example, there was no tender to build the six schools in the north of Scotland by the Miller Group-led north Scotland hubco. There is a lack of financial transparency: there is a belief that economies of scale may deliver better value for money, but we simply do not know whether that is the case. How much profit will the Miller Group make on the building of those six schools? Parliament simply does not know. What management fee is the Miller Group receiving for the contract? Parliament does not know.</p><p>Hubcos are not financially accountable, despite the vast amount of public money that is spent across Scotland on projects that we would all wish to see happen. Will hubco businesses be subject to the policies on the living wage and community benefit that we have discussed in Parliament this afternoon? They surely should be.</p><p>Finally, I ask members to consider the views of the Federation of Small Businesses on hubcos. Just this week, Andy Willox of the FSB said:</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m astonished the Scottish Government is deliberately excluding so much tax-payer-funded buying from the scope of their reforms. We are urging MSPs to look again at the legislation and ask if it is really appropriate for us to turn a blind eye to the purchasing practices of arms-length bodies and HubCos.&#8221;</p><p>The FSB supports the bill, but it believes that the issues in that area need to be addressed.

When schools are put into the programme, we do not know whether we achieve value for money because there is not a tender at that stage. It seems to be in the Government&#8217;s interests to seek to have that, so that, if the hubco model is not achieving value for money, perhaps it should be considered again from first principles.</p><p>For many of the reasons that James Kelly, Alex Johnstone and others have expressed, there appears to be a fundamental point: that &#163;1 billion of public spending should be covered by the bill, and we should support its inclusion.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Procurement Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-05-13", "body": "<p>Like Jim Eadie, I will apply the test of whether the bill will make a difference.

I hope that the community benefit regime that the Government is introducing and which all parties have supported in the passing of the bill, and the other measures in the bill, will help our councils and other public sector providers to ensure that procurement helps the local economy&#8212;in the case that I mentioned it was local agriculture&#8212;because that would be beneficial for many reasons, not least of which would be the food-miles argument that we make in a different context.</p><p>I hope that the bill is a considerable step forward, and I thank the Deputy First Minister for the spirit in which she has led on it.

Russia will use military force in support of coercive diplomacy when it feels that Russian interests are jeopardised.</p><p>What of the response? I do not know whether the minister shares my view that the western response to the annexation of Crimea has not been good enough. There is a lot of talk about economic sanctions, but tough, real measures would mean saying to BP, Chevron, Boeing and Siemens that they cannot do business in Russia. It is no wonder that, so far, action has been limited to naming and shaming a small number of Russian diplomats.</p><p>This is where high-minded diplomacy competes with economic power.

NATO will meet in full session in Cardiff in September. Its 28 members must define and address Russia&#8217;s recent record in Transnistria, South Ossetia, Abkhazia and, now, Crimea.</p><p>The NATO secretary general was right in what he said this morning in Brussels, because Russia has not once but many times rewritten international rules about the boundaries of sovereign countries. The Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are the most exposed and are NATO members. Were Russia to threaten annexation of them, NATO would be duty bound to invoke article 5: that an attack on one is an attack on all.

It said:</p><p>&#8220;The churches in Scotland are aware that Christianity has been a source of persecution in times gone by and it is in acknowledgement of this that we are committed to acting and praying for peace around the world.&#8221;</p><p>The SCPO went on to say that</p><p>&#8220;Although many high profile examples in the news today speak of Christians facing discrimination in predominantly Muslim societies, we do not see Islam as a threat or a problem ... and last year&#8217;s Assembly of the Conference of European Churches expressed solidarity with Christians and Muslims facing violence in North Africa and the Middle East&#8212;calling them &#8216;sisters and brothers&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>On 15 May in Sudan, Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 26 years old and eight months pregnant, was sentenced to death by hanging for apostasy, and to 100 lashes for adultery. Her crime was that she was unwilling to renounce her Christian faith. It is great news that, after a period of intense pressure on the Sudan minister of justice by Amnesty International, and general denunciation of Ibrahim&#8217;s detention by countries around the world, she has been released. That was a very serious case in which persecution on religious grounds was all too clear, and it should never have happened.</p><p>It is not just in Sudan that there are examples of Christians being persecuted. North Korea has become one of the most difficult places on earth for Christians to live. Christians are classified as &#8220;hostile&#8221;, and face arrest, detention and torture, or even public execution. There is a system of labour camps, including the renowned prison number 15, which is thought to house at least 6,000 Christians. The oppression of Christians there is continuing to grow.</p><p>In Iraq, there are terrifying reports that Christians are being targeted in Mosul by Isis militants and that many Christians are fleeing the region. The fundamentalists are giving Christians the grim choice of converting to Islam, paying a non-Muslim tax or facing death. In parts of the middle east including Saudi Arabia and Iran, Christian churches are outlawed, with Christians being persecuted and even condemned to death.</p><p>However, that type of scenario is not reserved solely for the middle east. In China, the Government has been ordering the demolition of Christian churches and there are reports that Christians who resist demolitions have been beaten, which has resulted in many people being hospitalised. As if that were not bad enough, in May this year a campaign was started to outlaw Christian church gatherings in homes and private dwellings.</p><p>This year alone in Nigeria, according to the advocacy group Jubilee Campaign, Islamist extremists Boko Haram and others have killed thousands of Christians for their faith.</p><p>There are numerous examples of Christians around the globe being persecuted and killed for their beliefs. What can we do? Well, Christians live out what they believe about God. We see in Proverbs that a Christian should be active in standing up for what is right, in rescuing those who are perishing, and in defending those who are poor and in need. Proverbs, chapter 31, verses 8 to 9 says:</p><p>&#8220;Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute. Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy&#8221;.</p><p>For the Christian, apathy and abdication are to be replaced by the active pursuit of justice.</p><p>According to recent census results, more than half of Scotland&#8217;s population identifies as Christian. A significant number of people in my constituency&#8212;Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch&#8212;hold their religion dear. We are fortunate in being able to practise our faith without fear of retribution, and for that we should thank God.</p><p>As convener of the Christians for independence group, I want a Scotland that condemns the persecution of people who express their religion, whether it happens at home or abroad. I want a Scotland that values people of faith and which unites, rather than divides, along religious lines; a Scotland that is welcoming to all; a Scotland that is international in outlook; and&#8212;this is important&#8212;a Scotland that enshrines in its constitution the right to have and express faith and the right to have no faith.</p><p>More than that, I want an outward-looking Scotland that will provide a safe haven for people who flee religious and other forms of persecution. I hope that that will be the mark of Scotland as a good global citizen.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the minister&#8217;s response.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Persecuted Christians"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>I, too, thank Rhoda Grant for securing this important debate.</p><p>The publication of the Bunchrew land declaration is an important contribution towards establishing new land ownership patterns in Scotland for the common good and in the public interest. Community Land Scotland also deserves our thanks for the work that it is doing on that vital issue.</p><p>Fundamentally, land is a God-given, finite, gift that must be used for the benefit of all. I am confident that any moves towards more people-centred land governance will meet with majority support in the Parliament and I urge Labour in particular to put aside party politics and join with those of us who are in favour of land reform to promote meaningful change. I was encouraged by Rhoda Grant&#8217;s call for working together on that, but there is a challenge.</p><p>The Bunchrew declaration recognises that Scotland&#8217;s land reform journey is behind that of most of Europe, where more equitable patterns of land ownership have been delivered in recent centuries. As Rhoda Grant and Malcolm Chisholm said, more than half of Scotland&#8217;s private land is owned by just 432 people with 10 per cent owned by 16 individuals or groups, which means that Scotland has one of the most unequal patterns of land ownership in Europe. We cannot say that often enough.</p><p>We&#8212;Labour and the SNP&#8212;recognise that the declaration is a positive step and we are in agreement that such patterns of land ownership in Scotland are not fit for a modern nation. We have to build on that.</p><p>The declaration is positive and is an embodiment of intention that is notable and is a strong marker on the Scottish land reform road. That is why I am confident that we will unite with Community Land Scotland in the coming years to bring the ideas that are contained within the declaration to fruition.</p><p>However, as a Parliament, we also have to be honest about how we are going to do that, and it would be remiss of me not to mention that Westminster still makes many decisions for us, such as on postal privatisation and the renewal of Trident nuclear missiles&#8212;decisions that are not supported by this chamber.</p><p>As Rob Gibson said, Westminster also decides on most aspects of taxation and, because the tax system plays an integral role in perpetuating our unfair and concentrated pattern of large-scale private land ownership, it will need amending if we are to make a real difference. That is unlikely to happen, despite the sterling efforts of Westminster&#8217;s Scottish Affairs Committee. The problem is that the establishment in London, the millionaires in the Cabinet and the members of the House of Lords will make it impossible to enact the type of radical reform we seek. The members of the House of Lords, especially, will always vote in the interests of their own kind, who have a vested interest in vast swathes of Scotland&#8217;s land and in keeping things as they are.</p><p>Members know what the answer is. We can eradicate the House of Lords at the stroke of a pen and take our taxation system into our own hands on 18 September. That will set us upon a true path to realising the aims of the Bunchrew declaration, and I hope that, on some level, that notion chimes with members of the chamber who are ordinarily against independence. I am sure that a majority of members in this chamber believe that there should be a fair distribution of land so that communities are able to fulfil their aspirations. However, we must be honest about how we achieve that.</p><p>We owe it to the people of Scotland to make sure that we make progress by advancing the principles of fairer patterns of land ownership, as laid out in the Bunchrew declaration, and by removing any blockages, such as the House of Lords, that prevent us from doing that.</p><p>The answer is in Labour&#8217;s hands, but does it have the courage to grasp it?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Bunchrew Land Declaration"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>Annabel Goldie said that she was giving us &#8220;facts&#8221;.

Women are key to the strength and resilience of Scotland&#8217;s economy and they have made a huge contribution to the recovery that we are seeing.</p><p>Women work in every sector of Scottish industry, but too often they do so on an unequal basis and, as reports from respected organisations such as the Fawcett Society show, they are not feeling the same financial benefits of the recovery. I and this Government are determined that women play the fullest possible role at all levels of our economy and, as they do so, I want to ensure that their valuable contribution is adequately rewarded.</p><p>Well-rewarded and sustained employment can be the best route out of poverty and the best way to tackle inequality. On Monday, I published &#8220;Unlocking Scotland&#8217;s Full Potential: boosting skills, wages, equality and growth&#8221;&#8212;a clear statement on the great value that we place on sharing our economic growth equally. Through equality of opportunity, we can create at all levels and in all areas of our economy a more diverse workforce that maximises our skills, improves the productivity of our businesses and grows our economy at an even faster rate.</p><p>We can deliver those ambitions because Scotland has great strengths and strong foundations from which to achieve progress. There are 1.25 million women employed in Scotland, which is the highest number since comparable records began, and the female inactivity rate is lower in Scotland than anywhere else in the United Kingdom. More young women than men stay on at school and are in higher and further education, and Scotland has the highest percentage in the UK of females with national vocational qualifications of at least level 3.</p><p>It is unacceptable that those strengths do not combine to create higher earnings for women in Scotland. Our gender pay gap remains unacceptably high at 7.6 per cent, and women earn 17 per cent less than men when we take hourly median earnings for full and part-time work together. Women&#8217;s average earnings are lower, with men typically earning &#163;90 a week more than women in full-time work.</p><p>The reasons for that are many, but, in short, too many women continue to face occupational segregation, greater job insecurity, higher levels of underemployment and pay inequality. That is not the type of labour market that can deliver the more equitable shares of economic growth, prosperity and opportunity that I believe Scotland must have.</p><p>The strategic group on women and work, which I chair, has, while engaging widely across the public and private sectors, played an important role in supporting our efforts to address those challenges, and our focus will be helped in the autumn when the Council of Economic Advisors publishes its report on maximising the economic potential of women in Scotland.</p><p>However, the reality is that this Government, with limited access to macroeconomic tools and legislative powers, is constrained in its ability to fully address the challenges. Instead of being able to share the benefits of growth, maximise our talents and unlock our potential, we have a position in Scotland today in which too many households struggle to meet their bills as wages are eroded and the cost of living increases. Around half of working-age adults and more than half of children in poverty live in working households and, despite the UK Government&#8217;s stated commitment to support families, women are disproportionately affected by its welfare reforms through changes to child benefit, working tax credit and lone parent benefit conditionality, and that disparity will continue as universal credit is introduced. I believe that those inequalities create an inarguable case for Scotland becoming an independent country. Only independence can address those issues and create a Scotland that provides the opportunities to meet women&#8217;s ambitions.</p><p>Too many women work in low-paid jobs, so the minimum wage impacts disproportionately on them. We understand and know the difficulties that that can create, and I believe that women deserve better. Therefore, with independence, the minimum wage will rise at least in line with inflation every year. If that had happened over the past five years, the lowest paid would have been &#163;600 a year better off. With responsibility for equalities legislation, we would address the scandalous inequalities in pay that persist despite the current system and 44 years of equal pay legislation.</p><p>Independence will allow us to protect women from the worst effects of welfare reform. We will develop a welfare system that is fair, personal and simple and that provides women with the same incentives to work as men. Current plans for universal credit mean that a higher level of partners&#8217; incomes will be taken into account as income when calculating the award. In &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8212;Your Guide to an Independent Scotland&#8221; we have committed to equalising the earnings disregard between first and second earners&#8212;who are more often women&#8212;under universal credit. It is estimated that doing so would benefit as many as 70,000 people by as much as &#163;1,200 a year. Of course, the Government is committed to scrapping universal credit under independence.</p><p>I want women to contribute fully to the success of Scotland&#8217;s businesses and its public and third sectors and to the continued strengthening of the Scottish economy, and I want that contribution to benefit women and their families equally. A lack of affordable, flexible childcare can be a significant barrier to many women accessing opportunities in employment, education or training. We are therefore investing more than &#163;0.25 billion in the next two years to expand the provision for three and four-year-olds and we will also extend that support to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged two-year-olds.</p><p>The commission for developing Scotland&#8217;s young workforce rightly sets out an ambitious agenda to improve access to employment for young people. Together with local government, we are working to implement the report&#8217;s recommendations. We have already made &#163;4.5 million of funding available, which includes support that will tackle gender segregation in training and employment programmes. In the autumn, I will set out more detailed plans for how we will work with schools, colleges, training providers and employers to ensure that existing stereotypes are challenged and barriers are removed.</p><p>Improving participation is one half of the challenge that we face in maximising Scotland&#8217;s productivity; as important is creating an environment in which all of those in work, including women, can thrive and prosper more equitably than they have been able to do so far. Last week, I welcomed the recommendations of the &#8220;Working Together Review&#8221; of progressive workplace policies. The review suggests how we can, through a partnership approach, address labour market challenges and build on existing good practice in our industrial relations. We will work with businesses and trade unions in framing our joint response to that review. Together with the commission on developing Scotland&#8217;s young workforce, that will provide Scotland with the opportunity to bring the right skills into the right jobs and to transform people&#8217;s lives and our workplaces through more equal access to work and fairer treatment in work.</p><p>I will update the Parliament on progress in two important areas. The &#8220;Working Together Review&#8221; recognised the value of a fair work commission, as envisaged in &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221;, as a means to support sustainable employment that pays fairly. Forty-four years on from the introduction of the Equal Pay Act 1970, it is clear that the current constitutional arrangements are not delivering for women in Scotland. I want early action so, with independence, the fair work commission will as its first priority begin to work collaboratively with unions, businesses and others to progress a review of the costs and benefits of mandatory equal pay audits.</p><p>We want women to be better represented at the highest levels of public authorities. On 30 April 2014, we launched the consultation &#8220;Women on Board&#8212;Quality through Diversity&#8221; to determine how a minimum quota of 40 per cent female representation could be introduced. The consultation closed on 4 July, and we received a range of views on how to address the gender imbalance on our boards, which has helped to focus our thinking on how best to address the barriers that women face.</p><p>Our commitment in that area makes it clear that this is not an issue on which we are prepared to wait any longer. Yesterday, Shona Robison wrote to the United Kingdom Government to request the transfer of legal competence in the equality field to the Scottish Parliament. We have made it clear that we believe that those powers should rest in Scotland as quickly as possible and in advance of full independence.</p><p>We will establish a short-life working group to develop a plan for the implementation of quotas, harnessing political support together with expertise around the appointments process to deliver truly gender-diverse boards with the highest calibre of men and women.</p><p>On 18 September, we have the opportunity to create an independent Scotland: a Scotland that is unconstrained in its ambition; a Scotland that will maximise opportunities for everyone in the economy, including women; and a Scotland that fully unlocks our potential.</p><p>The plans that I have outlined demonstrate that following a vote for independence we will use those powers to deliver a fairer and more equal society.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament welcomes the growth in women&#8217;s employment to its highest ever level of 1,250,000 and the significant reduction in female economic inactivity; believes that Scotland must have even higher ambitions to further increase the opportunities for women to enter the workforce; further believes that the Commission for Developing Scotland&#8217;s Young Workforce and the Working Together Review present important contributions to increasing opportunities for women; recognises however that significant powers to improve opportunities are currently reserved, and agrees that, with independence, these powers will give Scotland the opportunity to remove barriers to women&#8217;s ambitions and increase female economic activity, employment and living standards.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>Given that Ms Marra is a great believer in the power of Westminster to change our lives for the better, will she tell me why, if Westminster is such a success, the Equal Pay Act 1970&#8212;despite being as old as I am; that is how old it is&#8212;is still to be fully implemented?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>If Ms Marra had listened to my speech, she would know that the first priority of a fair work commission will be implementing mandatory equal pay audits so that we can identify and address the problem as speedily as possible and not wait until I am in my dotage or my 80s.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>I challenge Ms Marra on that point.

However, if there is one thing that I can say with absolute surety about the 2014 Commonwealth games, it is that they have changed the definition of the Glasgow kiss for ever. I have marched in the name of pride many times and I know the feeling very well. I felt pride with every act that demonstrated not just the success of the games&#8212;for which we all owe so many people thanks&#8212;but our values of respect and diversity.</p><p>During the games, the rainbow flag flew from the Scottish Government&#8217;s headquarters, and the one Scotland campaign was launched with billboards everywhere. The Pride house flourished&#8212;not a last-minute, hastily permitted Pride house as at London 2012, but a centre that was a real focal point for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex participants and guests and for discussion, hosting more than 6,000 visitors. The hub received financial support from the Scottish Government, but what matters much more are the political support that was received and the legacy that it will leave.</p><p>At the opening night for Pride house, Shona Robison, the cabinet secretary, was there on behalf of the Scottish Government, and so too was David Grevemberg, the games chief executive. This was not an unauthorised sideshow sitting on the fringes; it was an integral part of the games. During the games, the First Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Ed Miliband all visited, too. There were selfies for everyone and, fortunately, no bacon rolls. On 29 July, Peter Tatchell, a man more noted for attempting citizen&#8217;s arrests of Robert Mugabe than being gushing, was fulsome in his praise for the Scottish Government. An activist who is used to mealy-mouthed statements and disappointment came to Scotland and found the real deal of commitment to equality.</p><p>At that opening night, we heard important voices from beyond Scotland and the west, such as those of Dr Frank Mugisha from Uganda, Monica Tabengwa from Botswana and Pallav Patankar from India. They were part of a series of links made by campaigners in Scotland, with the aim of forging lasting links between campaigners here and those in countries where legal equality on LGBTI rights seems a far-off dream. Scotland&#8217;s campaigners recognise the importance of having their work led by those on the ground in those countries and using the Commonwealth games and the shared experience and history as an opportunity to empower others.</p><p>Each day, in the run-up to the games, the Equality Network highlighted a Commonwealth country and the equivalent organisation there. That matters, because 80 per cent of Commonwealth nations have some form of legal persecution of people who are homosexual, bisexual, transsexual and so on. Millions risk their liberty or their lives if they just turn to their loved one and express their feelings. That happens today in the Commonwealth.</p><p>It is a sad fact that those anti-gay laws are, in the main, a legacy of colonialism and imperialism. That troubled history of domination and conversion has left many nations scarred, and sensitive to what could be viewed&#8212;understandably so&#8212;as an attempt to repeat that history through further lectures or domination.</p><p>Uganda&#8217;s LGBTI laws have been a rallying point for activists around the world, but although the country&#8217;s laws are the most severe, it is by no means alone. Calls to exclude Uganda from the games came from an understandable sense of hurt, but there are many nations in the Commonwealth&#8212;such as Singapore, an authoritarian dictatorship&#8212;whose records on human rights raise very serious questions.</p><p>The best way to address the issue was to do what we did: continue with our approach of inspiration rather than domination. Scotland has achieved a level of diversity that is vastly different from the situation during the first 11 Commonwealth games, when being gay was still a crime here.</p><p>We want to demonstrate the kind of Scotland that we are, that we want to be and that we are increasingly becoming. Although the law now respects all, attitudes do not always do likewise. Sporting grounds are one of those fields in which reports of homophobia are still strongest and most frequent. If we are to get all of Scotland physically active and participating, the LGBTI group must be understood and those barriers must be overcome.</p><p>I hope that one legacy will be the links that have been built between organisations in Scotland. In particular, I hope that the Scottish Government will do what it can to encourage the continuation of Pride house as a centre for the promotion of LGBTI rights, in sport and more widely.</p><p>The games will be remembered as the people&#8217;s games, as the friendly games and as a successful games&#8212;and as a progressive games, too. I am sorry that Paul Wheelhouse has left the chamber, because I was going to rib him, as a Belfast boy, about the fact that team Northern Ireland came one place below the hypothetical team gay in the medals league table.</p><p>An important record was set by team gay at the games. It was the first time ever that two openly gay athletes&#8212;Matthew Mitcham and Tom Daley&#8212;took both gold and silver, and stood on the same podium.

There are places where even today&#8212;I find this sad, too&#8212;a person&#8217;s denomination may lead to intimidation or bigotry. However, the idea that Christians could be driven from churches or forbidden from gathering or that the Bible could be banned seems alien to us.</p><p>We live in a society that takes its holidays at Christmas and easter, which are Christian festivals, and our streets, towns and other places bear names of religious origin and significance&#8212;as do many people. Even our blasphemies are religious: it is said that every atheist is a Christian when they stub their toe.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s 15 centuries of Christian heritage are as much a part of our national story as our political history, our varied languages, our geography and our climate, which have all done so much to shape the modern Scot.

Therefore, it troubles me&#8212;this should trouble us all&#8212;that there have been societies, whether contemporary or historical, where holding any faith has been the subject of intimidation and ostracism and seen as heretical and criminal, leading all the way even to outright state persecution.</p><p>There is an elephant in the room, to which Patricia Ferguson referred. Some small &#8220;l&#8221; liberals find it genuinely difficult to rally to the cause of those around the world who are persecuted on the grounds of their religious beliefs as opposed their secular political views. That particularly applies to Christians.</p><p>Some Christians, such as the occupants of the white house, rank among the most powerful people in the world, but many do not. Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, the pregnant woman who has been referred to, was not powerful, nor was Sawan Masih, a Christian road sweeper from Lahore, and neither were the Coptic Christians who have been targeted in widespread attacks.</p><p>Each of those cases has been highlighted by Amnesty International and other organisations.

Those who feel the passion of their convictions will want to evangelise and spread their message&#8212;they always have&#8212;but they have an obligation to do so by persuasion and inspiration, not by coercion.</p><p>In too many countries around the world, those who disagree with Christianity have moved from the tools of preaching to the weapons of persecution. I have a great fear of what Governments can do when they are motivated by the dislike of those who hold other views, and of states that say that one must fear and hate that which is different and which use their powers and laws to turn neighbours against one another.</p><p>Mark chapter 12, verse 31 gives a very good message on that:</p><p>&#8220;we should love our neighbour, and desire for them all those good things both for the body and for the soul that we desire for ourselves.&#8221;</p><p>We do not have to be Christian to believe in that sentiment or to support it.</p><p>I whole-heartedly endorse the motion and look forward to a day when, all around the world, people have the right to believe as they wish and to observe the responsibility to respect the right of others to believe differently or not at all.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Persecuted Christians"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>The cabinet secretary has repeatedly referred to the gap between the judgment on 8 April and the announcement on the bill on 10 July.

Lonely Planet called us the third best country in the world to visit. Interestingly, alongside that article, it also had a list of the regions and areas within countries that were best to visit. Perhaps Lonely Planet has continued its reputation of always being ahead of the times and knowing what the next big thing is going to be. I, for one, was grateful for that little inclusion, alongside other independent countries and, indeed, Antarctica.</p><p>This homecoming has been a broad exercise in bringing together some things that had already been scheduled and that were already happening or always happening and putting them together with a brand that can be marketed both domestically and internationally.</p><p>Back in the run-up to the 2009 homecoming, the criticism was that we were focusing too much on the domestic market and not bringing enough people from abroad. It seems like we cannot win, but sometimes that is the feeling that we get in the chamber. The 2009 homecoming had 411 events. I was taken aback when Mike Cantlay came to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee and said, in a way that summed up his attitude, that we were at 827 and &#8220;about to stop counting.&#8221; The impression that was given was that we could have kept on going, but at some point VisitScotland had to draw the line and say, &#8220;This is homecoming.&#8221; It is no wonder that funding opportunities have been massively oversubscribed and that there has been reach throughout the Scottish Enterprise network.</p><p>The homecoming idea is such a neat way of packaging a country for the international market that we got the highest form of flattery&#8212;imitation&#8212;from Ireland, which in 2011 announced that 2013 was going to be its year of the gathering. Ireland took our idea and ran with it&#8212;as it so often does in tourism&#8212;and got 250,000 extra international visitors.

To the surprise of the questioner, all of us on the panel, including Dr David Toke, renewables expert and consultant for the European Greens, agreed on the need to use gas as a step-down fuel. As we have heard, per unit, gas releases less carbon than coal and even less with carbon capture and storage. Although Scotland will generate enough renewable electricity to meet our annual demand by 2020, gas is needed for the peaks and troughs, because it can be dialled up and down more flexibly than nuclear or any other competitor. In heating, gas will continue to be with us for some time to come.</p><p>Both of those issues have to be&#8212;and are being&#8212;taken into account in our world-leading emissions trajectory. Against that must be held the danger of drawing investment away from renewables, as nuclear has unquestionably done south of the border, as well as the carbon costs of extraction, which are higher the more unconventional the method, and the question of safety in an industry in which competing claims have left doubts that thus far have not reassured those who would see fracking next door.</p><p>There should be two lenses for considering unconventional gas. The first is that individuals should have the right to live in communities that are clean and safe and that are in control of their own future, which is a principle that I hold to whether the community is local, national or supranational. The second is the need for us as a society to reduce overall carbon emissions. Those should be the evidence tests not just for unconventional gas but for all energy sources, including renewables. Most people welcome our tremendous progress in that field, but we have to encourage projects in which communities are not just the neighbours but the principal initiators, owners and benefactors of the energy that is generated from their surroundings.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Energy and Climate Change"}, {"date": "2014-05-01", "body": "<p>In several of his answers, the minister has referred to the plight of parents in other parts of Scotland.

Will there be a review not just of current practices but of historical cases from 10 or 20 years ago that are continuing to bubble up?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Mortonhall Investigation Report&#8221;"}, {"date": "2014-04-24", "body": "<p>I rise as the elected representative of 31,000 people whose roof over their head is paid for by a monthly bill to a private landlord. At 39 per cent, Edinburgh Central&#8217;s rental share has doubled in a decade and is the highest in Scotland.</p><p>The private rented sector has long been the choice of students, new migrants and those who work in transient occupations, but today it is also the only option for the families locked out of social housing by the plummeting council house numbers that were the effect of right to buy, and for the younger generations priced out of buying their own home by two decades of soaring house prices during which any concerns were drowned out by back-slapping from mid-market self-congratulations by those who were lucky enough to buy in less turbocharged times.</p><p>The new report that was published this month by Shelter confirms that just one in six people in the private rented sector actually wants to be there. How ironic it is that Thatcher&#8217;s dream of home ownership was followed by a housing crisis hangover and home ownership falling for the first time in living memory.</p><p>With little security of tenure, city centre communities have become more transient, and services long cherished by long-term residents have had to be changed&#8212;in the face of understandably deep sentiment&#8212;to reflect the replacement of families with children with houses in multiple occupation. I say that not as a criticism but as a recognition. Cities change and living patterns change; they always have and they always will. The question is how we adapt and manage.</p><p>We now have landlord registration, independent tenancy deposit protection and tenancy information packs, and the illegal premiums that were formerly charged by 59 out of 60 Edinburgh letting agents surveyed&#8212;charges to get on a waiting list or to even be considered for a flat&#8212;have been ended.</p><p>In a market failure, when supply is quite literally fixed and unmoving and demand is ever increasing, it is not just right but vital that we intervene to deal with the inevitable unfairness that the imbalance creates.</p><p>The private rented sector tribunal will speed up adjudication as well as, crucially, providing a specialist space and avoiding the need for tenants and landlords to go to the sheriff court for enforcement.</p><p>The landlord-tenant relationship is an intrinsically precarious one, which the landlord can end at any point with little warning. No wonder it is so easy for tenants to feel that they are living in someone else&#8217;s asset rather than their own home. No wonder, either, that private rented homes are often of the lowest quality and have the poorest maintenance, which has implications not least for neighbours.</p><p>Tenants have told me time and time again of their fears about trying to press their rights and struggling to find a lawyer willing to take on their case and of their apprehension at possibly being blacklisted as a troublemaker by other letting agents. For new arrivals to Scotland, it is especially hard. Giving local authorities the power to inspect and report on the repairing standard will help to address that. Giving the power to neighbours could help even more. I would be interested to hear the minister&#8217;s response to that suggestion from Edinburgh.</p><p>Regulation of letting agents means that good practice may become standard practice. If that is implemented well, the new tribunal will be out of a job and we can look forward to empty rooms and bored lawyers because the disputes will not emerge. Maybe that is too much to hope for, but we should all welcome the fact that letting agents, too, support that move because they also realise the importance of the industry being of high repute.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s provisions will help this country govern a private rented sector that is groaning under the weight of a massive expansion, but I believe that we must also look at the horizon and consider what we want the mix of housing ownership and tenure to look like in another decade&#8217;s time.</p><p>Yesterday, the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee heard accounts of inequality in Scotland and the UK and was given a crucial reminder to consider both inequality of income and inequality of wealth. The implication in private renting is fairly straightforward: a private tenant has fewer assets than their landlord and the gap between them grows with every monthly rental payment.</p><p>In the short term, we must ensure that rights and responsibilities on both sides are enforced and continue the commendable progress in increasing the supply of social housing. However, let us all take a moment to imagine a society where the proportion of people renting the roof over their head has doubled again. Is that a future where equality is lower or higher and where communities are more cohesive or more atomised?

An independent Scotland might be able to make a small contribution, but the reality is that, on many of these issues, it would be only an observer. We need to remember the positive contribution that the UK makes and might make for decades to come and not throw that away.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Department for International Development"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>Forced to change his narrative every time he opens his mouth, will the cabinet secretary now confirm that yes campaigners are being mendacious when they say all over Scotland that the Scottish NHS would be privatised following a no vote and ill-informed when they say that privatised services cost less public money, contrary to the view of NHS campaigners in England?

In view of that, I thank all those who helped me and, no doubt, others to understand better&#8212;namely, the adviser in particular, the clerks, the witnesses, the bill team and the cabinet secretary himself.</p><p>I also thank the cabinet secretary for taking on board so many of the committee&#8217;s recommendations in his stage 2 amendments and, of course, in further amendments today. I should thank him particularly for the amendment in which he picked up a point that I made in committee. Referring to artificiality in the GAAR, I asked why the reference to &#8220;reasonable business conduct&#8221; in section 59 should not be extended to include personal conduct. I welcome the amendment that the cabinet secretary lodged to deal with that issue.</p><p>The word &#8220;reasonable&#8221; has haunted our discussions. I even found myself at one point saying that the UK double reasonableness test was quite reasonable. In the end, I am quite happy to defer to the Government in that regard.</p><p>On the general anti-avoidance rule, there were some concerns that the bill had been drawn too broadly and that the language that was used in defining what constitutes a reasonable action was too vague. Part 5 of the bill outlines that any activity that has the obtaining of a tax advantage as the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the arrangement may be deemed unlawful. I believe, however, that it is right to draw the rule quite widely as, historically&#8212;and specifically in the case of HMRC&#8212;the use of a more targeted or narrow approach has led to the emergence of loopholes that can be abused by businesses. Having the principles of the GAAR enshrined in the bill will, I hope, mitigate the need for any targeted rules for tax avoidance in future.</p><p>Further to that, although I recognise that the double reasonableness test may be construed as being unnecessarily complicated, its absence from this new legislation means that we must make absolutely certain that channels are made available to challenge any decision in a timely and fair manner. Therefore, a vigorous approach to tax avoidance must be balanced by a fair appeals system. I raised that issue at stage 1 in the committee with the cabinet secretary, and the committee recommended that he reconsider the restrictive rule governing appeals in the Court of Session and the number of members of the upper tax tribunal for appeals. I would welcome reassurance from the cabinet secretary, in his wind-up speech, about the fairness of the appeals system.</p><p>Another issue of fairness concerns the contrast between the advice that is offered by lawyers and accountants and to what extent it should be privileged. I believe that what is and is not privileged advice should apply equally to all advisers, whether or not they are lawyers. I would welcome a statement of the Government&#8217;s most up-to-date thinking on that matter.</p><p>Finally on fairness, equality between taxpayers and revenue Scotland is also important. Part 2 of the bill addresses the establishment of revenue Scotland and provides for its general functions and responsibilities as we take forward the devolution process. Looking at the final draft, it is reassuring to see that a number of the recommendations that were made at the committee stage have been taken on board by the cabinet secretary with regards to that process. That includes putting taxpayers and revenue Scotland on an even footing in the expectations that are placed upon them in the charter. That was not the case in previous stages of the bill. The change of language to</p><p>&#8220;standards of behaviour and values which revenue Scotland is expected to adhere to&#8221;,</p><p>rather than &#8220;aspire to&#8221;, will not only reassure taxpayers but firmly cement the duties of the new body on the face of the bill.</p><p>Section 10(3A) of the bill should also be welcome as it offers the assurance that the charter will be drafted and subsequently redrafted only after revenue Scotland consults such persons as it considers appropriate. That is good news, as the charter should not be skewed towards the interests of revenue Scotland but, rather, should represent the best practice for the widest number of stakeholders. I would, however, welcome a little more in the way of reassurance that revenue Scotland will engage with as many stakeholders as is practically possible, making it absolutely clear to Parliament who has been involved and for what reason.</p><p>With regard to the delegation to Registers of Scotland and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency of duties relating to land and buildings transaction tax and landfill tax respectively, I welcome the pledge to publish information concerning the nature of that delegation and to lay it before Parliament, and the fact that revenue Scotland will still be ultimately responsible for carrying out delegated functions. Those powers may be delegated as and when revenue Scotland sees fit. Although I support the theory behind that, I was somewhat concerned by some of the evidence on the balance of responsibilities and the pressures that that may bring. The Faculty of Advocates was keen to point out that certain powers, such as the power to levy a penalty or to make an assessment, are inherently the concern of the taxing authority, and that revenue Scotland should not be given carte blanche to delegate at will. Powers must be delegated according to what works best where. Some responsibilities are best kept within the remit of revenue Scotland.</p><p>The tax system that a country adopts goes fundamentally to the heart of what sort of society we wish to create. I believe that, within the framework of devolution, it is possible to achieve the best outcomes for Scotland. In co-operating so well, the Finance Committee and the cabinet secretary have provided Parliament with an effective foundation stone for fiscal devolution. The bill that is before us, with its enshrined charter of responsibilities, will encourage a relationship of respect between the taxpayer and the authority, based on transparency and accountability. I congratulate all members who have been involved with this process and hope that, in future years, the same approach will be applied.

We have heard the misleading ones, such as how Scotland has raised more in tax revenues. That is true but, of course, we did not hear about the fact that we have more public expenditure. In the last year for which figures were available, we raised &#163;700 more per head in tax in Scotland because of the oil, but we received &#163;1,200 more per head in public expenditure.</p><p>Many of the assertions that have been made could be delivered now. They are not problematic; it is just that they are not being delivered.</p><p>Other assertions were made about what would happen around increased productivity, for example, but there was absolutely no detail or explanation of how that will happen. The only specific policy that we got was the folly of once again outdoing the Tories on corporation tax. Since John Swinney will soon be standing up and telling me about Gordon Brown, he should know that Labour is committed to increasing the rate of corporation tax by 1p. In spite of what his fiscal commission tells him about the folly of a tax that is 3p below the UK rate, he is hell-bent on doing it. He should look at what happened in Canada. When it made a big cut in corporation tax, business hoarded the money and there were hikes in executive pay. John Swinney should think again on that.</p><p>The reality is that John Swinney&#8217;s economic objectives and dreams depend on secure currency arrangements and sound public finances. In both those key regards, we are better off now than we would be. We already have a currency union and the benefits of a deeply integrated UK economy without borders. In a new book this week from the David Hume Institute, David Bell reminds us that GDP falls by 5 per cent because of the border effect. We should remember that 70 per cent of our exports go to England and 74 per cent of our imports come from England. In contrast, 14 per cent of UK exports come here and 8 per cent of its imports come from Scotland.

Remember that 15 per cent of our exports are financial services. We have heard a lot of rhetoric today about exports, but that is the reality of a key export sector in the event of Scottish independence.</p><p>I could have spent my whole speech quoting independent experts on the fiscal situation: the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Centre for Public Policy for Regions, Citigroup, the Pensions Policy Institute, Brian Ashcroft and Martin Wolf. I do not have time to do that, but I will quickly give two quotes. First, Angus Armstrong and Monique Ebell said:</p><p>&#8220;An independent Scotland is likely to require a more restrictive fiscal stance than proposed by the coalition government for many years.&#8221;</p><p>Secondly, Rowena Crawford and Gemma Tetlow, also of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, have said:</p><p>&#8220;our broad conclusion&#8212;that Scotland faces a tougher long-run fiscal challenge than the UK as a whole&#8212;is robust to a variety of alternative, sensible assumptions.&#8221;</p><p>The spending commitments that are the basis of the Scottish Government&#8217;s appeal to the Scottish people are a cruel deception on the Scottish people, because the reality is that under independence in 2016 we would lose hundreds of millions of pounds right away in up-front corporation tax.

For example, Tim Duffy, who is one of the great peace campaigners in Scotland of the past few decades, in an editorial in the most recent edition of the Justice and Peace Scotland magazine, said that there were several problems with the logic of voting yes to get rid of Trident. One example that he gave was that the realpolitik of the situation would make it very tempting for the Scottish Government to accept a deal with the UK Government. It is interesting that, in the debate with Alistair Darling last night, the First Minister was keen to mention again and again the mysterious unnamed UK minister who said that there would be a shared single currency, but the First Minister did not mention that that unnamed minister said that there would be a single currency because the UK Government would do a deal on Trident.

The declaration points out the lack of fairness in land distribution and reaffirms Community Land Scotland&#8217;s commitment to a fair but radical alternative. At present, Community Land Scotland represents members who manage roughly 500,000 acres of land, which contains up to 25,000 residents. Those residents all stand to gain from the positive experience of engaging with and making the most of the land around them. As Andy Wightman points out in his publication &#8220;The Poor Had No Lawyers: Who Owns Scotland (And How They Got It)&#8221;, half of the country&#8217;s privately owned land is held by just 432 owners and as few as 16 owners hold 10 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s natural land resources. That is quite simply unacceptable.</p><p>Ownership empowers communities and gives a greater sense of participation and inclusion. We need only look abroad to see examples of that. The Bunchrew land declaration states that,</p><p>&#8220;having explored the parallels with land reform internationally&#8221;,</p><p>Community Land Scotland has found that</p><p>&#8220;Scotland lags behind land reform interventions which in Europe delivered greater land justice in past centuries&#8221;.</p><p>That is the case in France, for example, where patterns of ownership of national forests differ enormously from the current inequitable Scottish situation. As it stands, more than 44 per cent of private forests in Scotland are over 100 hectares in size and account for more than 94 per cent of the forest area. The conditions of tenure for workers and communities who live on that land are determined by a relatively small group of people. By comparison, French farmers, like farmers elsewhere in Europe, are also foresters, which means that there are no big estates with tenants relying on a landlord&#8217;s good will. At the same time, public forests are owned by local communities, which gives a far more equitable outcome for all stakeholders.</p><p>In Andy Wightman&#8217;s article &#8220;Scottish forestry still in hands of an elite&#8221;, he points out that the reasons why Scottish private forestry is dominated by large-scale absentee landowners is partly down to established ownership patterns in which a tiny elite possessed the land and all farmers were tenants. Until 2004, the law stated clearly that trees belonged to the landlord, so farmers have never been forest owners. As a result, huge swathes of prominent and valuable woodland are beyond the reach of community ownership, and that has remained largely unchallenged.</p><p>The declaration also touches on the human rights element of land reform, citing &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s National Action Plan for Human Rights 2013-2017&#8221;, which seeks to increase people&#8217;s understanding of human rights and their participation in decisions. The Bunchrew declaration is correct to identify that as one key area that has yet to be properly discussed. The use of land directly affects the wellbeing of citizens and therefore current legislation on community empowerment should reflect the human rights impacts.</p><p>That starts with information. Urban and rural communities have voiced a desire to know who owns the land around them, but as yet Scotland lags behind most comparable European countries in providing such data. Angus Robertson of Community Land Scotland, in evidence to the Scottish Affairs Committee consultation on land reform, highlighted that transparency and accountability in respect of land ownership are seriously damaged by the lack of a full register of rural ownership. He said that, even where the ownership is available, some &#8220;hide behind charitable status&#8221; and</p><p>&#8220;have a board of trustees which has no local representation on it at all.&#8221;</p><p>That situation cannot continue.</p><p>I welcome the reaffirmation of the values of Community Land Scotland in the Bunchrew declaration, which sets out a shared agenda that I hope all members will get behind, including with regard to the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>I welcome the motion and give it my support.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Bunchrew Land Declaration"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/10102.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:25", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "10102", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Malcolm Chisholm", "member_id": "80439", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Edinburgh Northern and Leith"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Malcolm", "last_name": "Chisholm", "left_house": "2011-03-23", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/10102.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:25", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "10102", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Malcolm Chisholm", "member_id": "80296", "entered_house": "2007-05-03", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Edinburgh North and Leith"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Malcolm", "last_name": "Chisholm", "left_house": "2007-04-02", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/10102.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:25", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "10102", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Malcolm Chisholm", "member_id": "80018", "entered_house": "2003-05-01", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Edinburgh North and Leith"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Malcolm", "last_name": "Chisholm", "left_house": "2003-03-31", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/10102.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:25", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "10102", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Malcolm Chisholm", "member_id": "80140", "entered_house": "1999-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Edinburgh North and Leith"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Gordon", "last_name": "MacDonald", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p></p><p>6.

Whether to supply a pint of milk and a newspaper in the morning or a few messages on the way home from work, they are open and ready to serve from early in the morning to late at night in every city and town and in every rural and island community across Scotland. Indeed, Scotland has more convenience stores per head of the population than any other part of the United Kingdom and they employ over 41,000 people. To put that into context, that is more people than the combined total employment provided in agriculture, or forestry, or fishing or the motor trade in Scotland.</p><p>It is not just direct employment that local shopkeepers provide, but employment for their contractors and suppliers. The vast majority of convenience stores are owned and operated by small business owners, and because they are part of the local community they tend to use local contractors and suppliers. Research by the Scottish Grocers Federation identified that a typical convenience store reinvests &#163;250,000 in the local economy by using local tradesmen, local produce suppliers, local shop fitters and local garages as well as local legal and accountancy firms. As a result, convenience stores are, I believe, one of the cornerstones of a community in the same way as the primary school, the community centre, the post office and the pub. Their presence in a village, town or neighbourhood helps to support that community. In addition, many corner shops provide a range of services, such as a cash machine, a bill payment service, home delivery or even just a notice board, all of which help to sustain the local community.</p><p>All is not well in the convenience store sector, especially among family-owned businesses. Two main issues affect them: the growth of the convenience store network of the big four supermarkets and the resultant overprovision of grocery stores. The decision by the large supermarket chains to move into the convenience store sector in Scotland has put pressure on small independents. In the current economic climate, customers&#8217; income has, in many cases, not kept pace with inflation, and the outcome is that the available spend in an area is spread more thinly across all the retailers, with the result that the viability of some stores has been brought into question.</p><p>The expansion by the big four supermarket chains into convenience stores is detrimental not just to small independent shopkeepers, but to other small businesses, because the large conglomerates tend to have national contracts for maintenance and servicing and international suppliers, which results in the loss of the local economic benefit that is generated by having a locally owned store.</p><p>The other issue that I mentioned is the overprovision of grocery stores. I will use an example from my constituency to highlight the problems that it can cause. Along the stretch of the B701 from Oxgangs Road North to Colinton Mains Drive, there are two large supermarkets, one multiple convenience store operator and three independently owned convenience stores in the space of just over a mile. It is an area of my constituency that most people would consider to be well served by grocery stores and to have healthy competition and choice.</p><p>However, along with its partner, City of Edinburgh Council has decided to sell land that was previously occupied by a social work building and a church to a major grocery discount store operator. The local community is split. Many families would welcome the discounter, while others have signed a petition that opposes the building of yet another supermarket. Their reasons for doing so include the effect of increased traffic congestion, which would result in additional traffic noise and deteriorating air quality, the effect on existing employment and, ultimately, possible store closures.</p><p>There is also disappointment in the local community that the land has not been designated for housing, as there is unmet demand for new housing in the area. Many members of the congregation of the now closed St John&#8217;s church were under the impression that the land would be used for much-needed housing, but they now find that a licensed premises could occupy what was the church ground in an area where there are already eight licensed premises. It is at such times that the city planners have to take a step back and ask themselves whether the location of another supermarket is in the best interests of the whole community.</p><p>In doing so, council officials should examine the job creation claims and assess whether the proposed employment opportunities will really be new posts or will simply be employment that has been displaced from existing operators who need to downsize their operation to meet their reduced revenue.</p><p>A study by the UK retail trade association, the Association of Convenience Stores, entitled &#8220;Job Creation Claims in New Supermarket Retail Developments&#8221; found that, in many instances, the claims about the number of jobs created simply represented a head count. As part-time posts make up 49 per cent of all retail opportunities, the number of full-time equivalent jobs will, in most cases, be substantially lower than that claimed by the supermarket.</p><p>If the new supermarket in my constituency is given the go-ahead, I will be concerned about the survival of all three small independent stores and the possible reduction in the number of employment opportunities that are provided by the existing supermarket operators. Members of the convenience store sector, unlike the large supermarket chains, do not have reserves that allow them to trade at a loss for a prolonged period of time.</p><p>Since 2008, many small businesses have experienced difficult trading circumstances, and the introduction of the Scottish Government&#8217;s small business bonus scheme has assisted them. Across Scotland, owners of 92,000 small businesses, many of whom own local convenience stores, have had their rates abolished or substantially reduced.</p><p>However, this is not just about existing businesses. We need to make our shopping areas more attractive by offering a wider, more diverse mix of high-street businesses, and we need to encourage young entrepreneurs to create new businesses that make use of the vacant premises in our town centres and neighbourhood shopping areas. A more diverse high street or shopping area will generate a higher footfall that should benefit all businesses in the area.</p><p>The Carnegie UK Trust, which has developed a number of retail initiatives from pop-up retail festivals to an online toolkit for examining a town&#8217;s characteristics, states in its briefing:</p><p>&#8220;We recognise that for many towns, the contribution of independent retailers is a crucial factor in the long-term sustainability, diversity and vibrancy of high streets.&#8221;</p><p>That &#8220;sustainability, diversity and vibrancy&#8221; can be achieved only if everyone involved in developing our towns and cities recognises the importance of the independent convenience store sector&#8217;s contribution to our economy and understands the importance of sustaining it.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Independent Retailers"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p></p><p>5.

There are lessons arising from the development of the local development plans and SESplan, but we need to remember that they arise because Edinburgh is one of the economic powerhouses of not only Scotland but the United Kingdom. People are attracted here because of employment opportunities and the quality of life. As a result, there is an unmet demand for housing in and around the Edinburgh area. Indeed, that is a result of not just an increasing population but growth in the number of single adult households.</p><p>Local authorities throughout the Lothians have a responsibility to calculate the demand for housing in their areas. They then have a duty to allocate sufficient land to meet the demand that they have identified. That then forms the local development plan, which in turn feeds into SESplan. The problem lies in identifying sufficient and suitable land within the city boundary to meet the demand for housing.</p><p>A number of issues for Edinburgh in general and for the west of the city in particular should be considered by councillors and local authority officials before allocating land. Traffic congestion at peak times is a major issue, particularly in the west of the city. Data supplied by a leading satellite navigation company places Edinburgh as the third most congested city in the UK. During the morning rush hour, estimated journey times are on average 34 per cent longer than usual, with the figure rising to 60 per cent. The situation will only get worse as the thousands of new homes that are already approved are built in areas in West Lothian and Fife, all of which are commutable into Edinburgh. Councillors need to say how the road network will cope with further increases in traffic before deciding whether to build in the west of the city.</p><p>We have poor air quality in and around the four main arterial routes into the west of the city. Of the four routes, Queensferry Road, Glasgow Road and Gorgie Road regularly fail the European Union air quality standard, with Lanark Road recording increasing levels of pollutants. I have raised the issue before and I continue to believe that, if Edinburgh councillors accept the revised LDP that the officials propose, they could be adding to the problem, with a resultant reduction in quality of life for residents who live close to those roads.</p><p>If Edinburgh councillors are looking after the best interests of residents in the west of the city, they should comply with Scottish planning policy by ensuring that housing is built on brownfield land first and greenbelt land last, if at all. In my constituency of Edinburgh Pentlands, some of the land that is identified in the Edinburgh LDP is agricultural land. Scotland is rightly proud of being one of the few countries that is able to feed itself. We cannot continue to lose good-quality arable land to developers when brownfield sites exist. Sarah Boyack read out a list of all the brownfield sites that have not been developed. It suits developers to build on greenfield sites, as the costs of development are lower and there is a price premium because the sites are in nice leafy suburbs.</p><p>The council must deal with the issue of empty homes in the capital, the number of which was recently estimated to be 4,300. The council recently announced the employment of an empty homes officer, who needs to help owners to bring those properties back into use as a matter of urgency.</p><p>The Scottish Government has invested heavily in the Airdrie to Bathgate railway line and the new Borders railway.

There are just short of 350,000 small businesses in Scotland, and they provide more than 1 million jobs, which is half of all private sector employment in Scotland. To continue to grow our economy, we need to encourage the creation of new businesses and the expansion of existing businesses. We need to encourage businesses, where possible, to export and sell online.</p><p>The people of Scotland are this country&#8217;s greatest asset. We have a highly educated population, with 39 per cent of our working adults having an HND, a degree or a professional qualification compared to 35 per cent in the UK as a whole. Here in Edinburgh, the proportion is even higher, at 54 per cent of the adult population.</p><p>We need to encourage, nurture and support budding entrepreneurs. The global entrepreneurship monitor reports, which are published by the University of Strathclyde business school, measure how well we perform in that area. Regarding start-ups, the most recent report compares Scotland&#8217;s total early-stage entrepreneurial activity&#8212;TEA&#8212;with that in 26 innovation-driven sovereign nations. The study found that Scotland has significantly higher rates of developing or new business-owner enterprises across the working population than Italy and Japan. Scotland&#8217;s TEA rate, at 6.8 per cent, is on a par with that of other European countries such as France, Germany and Norway. However, the rate differed between males and females, with the male TEA rate in Scotland being 8.5 per cent compared to 8.7 per cent for the UK and female start-up rates being 5.2 per cent in Scotland compared to 5.8 per cent across the UK.</p><p>The GEM report suggests that the motivation of women entrepreneurs in starting a business varies widely and can include factors such as career constraints, work-family balance and financial freedom. The report also found that significant wealth creation tended to be of secondary importance for most, but not all, women entrepreneurs. As a result, many of the new businesses are in personal services and retailing, where relatively low start-up capital is required.</p><p>By encouraging and supporting women to start new businesses to the same level as male start-ups, grow existing businesses, and&#8212;where possible&#8212;start to export, we would generate more than &#163;7 billion for the economy. The Hunter centre for entrepreneurship estimates that that would create about 35,000 direct jobs.</p><p>Women&#8217;s Enterprise Scotland carried out a survey of women-owned businesses in Scotland. The survey found that access to finance was the most frequently mentioned need, with only 50 per cent of women finding their banks helpful. Business support was identified as another area where assistance was required, not only at the early stages of developing a business but later, when businesses are at the point of wishing to grow. Those women who had access to a mentor found that the vast majority of mentors proved to be very helpful in providing advice.</p><p>The business gateway was identified as a main source of business support, helping about 10,000 start-ups every year, with two thirds of businesses started by women finding its services helpful. The Women&#8217;s Enterprise Scotland survey also found that women recognised that, despite the challenges, they should consider growing their businesses and, among its key findings, the survey highlighted that 87 per cent of women-owned businesses aim to grow, with 27 per cent aiming to grow rapidly.</p><p>We also need to encourage more entrepreneurship among young people. Entrepreneurship should be recognised as a valid, viable and rewarding career choice for all young people. The self-employed rate for 16 to 24-year-olds is currently a disappointing 2 per cent. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#8217;s &#8220;Policy Brief on Youth Entrepreneurship&#8221; highlights the barriers that the young face, which prevent some of them from turning ideas into projects. It states that they</p><p>&#8220;arise in the areas of social attitudes, lack of skills, inadequate entrepreneurship education, lack of work experience, under capitalisation, lack of networks, and market barriers.&#8221;</p><p>That applies across Europe, not just in Scotland or the UK.</p><p>We need to address those issues. The curriculum for excellence is doing that, by ensuring that enterprise education is embedded in young people&#8217;s learning. In addition, good schemes are encouraging young people to consider starting a business, some of which are described in &#8220;Scotland CAN DO&#8221;, which sets out a vision of Scotland as a world-leading entrepreneurial and innovative nation.</p><p>One such scheme, Micro-Tyco, is a groundbreaking enterprise challenge. The WildHearts Foundation runs the scheme, which has had more than 10,000 participants, from schoolchildren to business executives. The vision is to ignite the spirit of enterprise in our culture. Micro-Tyco challenges teams to take inspiration from the WildHearts Foundation&#8217;s microfinance clients in the developing world and grow &#163;1 into as much money as possible, in just four weeks. The scheme&#8217;s unique combination of inspiration, business mentorship, positive peer pressure and ethics produces incredible results. More than &#163;500,000 has been returned from just 1,900 loans of &#163;1.</p><p>Another scheme is the young innovators challenge, which was won by a young female graduate of the Edinburgh College of Art. The competition aims to encourage young people in college or university to come up with innovative ideas. It is funded by the Scottish Government and run by the Scottish Institute for Enterprise. In 2013, competition entrants were asked to come up with innovative solutions to challenges that industry leaders had set. Finalists pitched their ideas to a panel of business experts, for a chance to win development funding of up to &#163;50,000 and business support.</p><p>&#8220;Scotland CAN DO&#8221; highlights what we can do to support more young people, including females, to become entrepreneurs.

Edinburgh TV and Glasgow TV are the only new Scottish channels announced so far, but I understand that Ofcom will be advertising licences later this year for the Aberdeen, Ayr, Dundee, Falkirk and Inverness areas.</p><p>The channels are necessary because we see so little of Scotland and Scottish culture on the existing public sector broadcaster, the BBC. According to the BBC&#8217;s own management review, BBC Scotland&#8217;s local television original output for 2012-13 was 778 hours. That was at the same time that Scottish licence fee payers contributed &#163;320 million to BBC coffers.</p><p>The new channels ETV and GTV will broadcast from 12 noon until midnight seven days a week. That means that each of them will broadcast a total of 4,368 hours a year, which is more than four times the total number of hours of local television that are broadcast by BBC Scotland.</p><p>It is even more remarkable that the stations will operate on a fully commercial business model, as they decided to reject the option of receiving funding from the BBC, which had hoped to purchase content from the Scottish channels and the UK-wide local TV network to the tune of &#163;5 million per annum for three years.</p><p>STV Local has freed itself from having to provide the BBC with access to its content, which it hopes will be able to attract its own revenue. In order to attract that revenue, I understand that the new channels will provide a mix of local content and programming, which will include news, current affairs and live shows, as well as quality acquired and archived programming.</p><p>In developing the new channels, STV and its partners need to consider how they can address the totally inadequate level of broadcasting of programming on our arts, music, entertainment and comedy, on which BBC Scotland managed to broadcast only 36 hours of programming in the year to March 2013. There is hope that they might indeed do that, given that, at last year&#8217;s Edinburgh Napier media Monday event, Bobby Hain, director of channels at STV, stated:</p><p>&#8220;Securing the local TV licence for Edinburgh means we will be bringing relevant and engaging content to the capital on a brand new platform. This is an exciting opportunity and one we are looking forward to delivering in partnership with Edinburgh Napier University.&#8221;</p><p>We are not talking only about an opportunity to reflect our society on the wee screen, as the new channels will present opportunities to the students who attend the partner universities. Edinburgh Napier University students who study journalism will be given the opportunity to work and train in a live TV environment, while work experience will also be available to students who take other media courses. Edinburgh Napier has a track record of producing top journalism and media graduates, and I am sure that the students will prove invaluable to the community programming that is planned for ETV.</p><p>Despite the best efforts of STV and Edinburgh Napier, ETV and GTV will be successful only if they attract an audience and, as a result, advertising revenue. That is where the problem lies because, when the licence was awarded, Digital UK originally allocated the stations channel 45 on the Freeview platform. It has now reconsidered that decision and will move them to channel 23. Across the UK, the other local channels that produce programmes will broadcast on channel 8. Now that the BBC is taking BBC 3 off the air, surely the solution would be to move BBC Alba to channel 7, which would mean that ETV and GTV could be broadcast on channel 8 as well.</p><p>The alternative that is proposed for channel 7 is that it be used for BBC 1 +1, which by its very nature will be a repeat channel with no original content, and very little of its content will have emanated from Scotland. That is unacceptable and, if the proposal is allowed to go ahead unchanged, it will again highlight why broadcasting in Scotland should be regulated by the Scottish Parliament.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Television"}, {"date": "2014-05-27", "body": "<p>The Local Government and Regeneration Committee is to be congratulated on producing the report &#8220;Delivery of Regeneration in Scotland&#8221;.

I believe that community-led regeneration is the key to the success of any project, and I agree with Kevin Stewart that people must be at the heart of the decision making. The Scottish Government and local authorities have the ability to physically transform an area, but it is only when members of the community come together to tackle their social problems that an effective solution can be found.</p><p>Back in the 1990s, the Broomhouse area of my constituency was known as little Bosnia as a result of the antisocial behaviour that was rife in the area at the time. The Scottish index of multiple deprivation rated it then as being in the worst 5 per cent for employment, health and housing and the worst 2 per cent for education, skills and training. Local residents decided that they had had enough, and a number of charities were established to tackle some of the root problems that were associated with the area. What we now know as the Broomhouse Centre was established in 1989 with the advancement of education and health and the provision of recreation facilities as its purposes. The object was to improve the conditions of life for local people, including those in need by reason of age, ill health, disability or financial hardship.</p><p>In 1993, the Broomhouse Health Strategy Group was established with the aim of promoting healthy lifestyles in the local community by providing access to good-quality and low-cost healthy produce and by raising awareness of health issues in the local community. The BIG Project was formed in 2002 to provide support for children and young people aged five to 16 to develop and reinforce young people&#8217;s skills, confidence and self-image by providing a range of activities using the school&#8217;s gym hall, Astroturf pitch and activity rooms. By adopting a preventative approach, the project has overcome issues of territorialism and has healed divisions between groups of young people. The project recognises, respects and encourages the initiatives of young people, allowing them to be heard and to express their views, but it also challenges young people to understand the consequences of their actions and attitudes.</p><p>In 2005, the Broomhouse empowerment project inspired the regeneration of the open space at Broomhouse Grove with a new multi-use games area, play equipment, fencing and landscaping. The new ball court and play area give youngsters somewhere to congregate and play sport in a safe environment. Thanks to investment by the Scottish Government, the previous Scottish Executive and the council, there are new schools and housing in Broomhouse. In the latest housing development, Oaklands in Broomhouse Crescent, 40 per cent of the housing available for sale has been sold, and that is even before the show home opens this summer. Many of the people who have purchased homes are second or third-generation families returning to the area.</p><p>Over the years, various groups operating in Broomhouse have rebuilt the area&#8217;s community spirit, which was reflected recently in the mural project that the Broomhouse Health Strategy Group instigated.</p><p>The Broomhouse market area was one of the few places that still reflected the vandalism of the past. The problem was that it was in private ownership, the landlord had limited resources to tackle the problem and the council was reluctant to invest limited resources in shops that were privately owned.</p><p>The members of the Broomhouse Health Strategy Group took it upon themselves to brighten up the area with the owner&#8217;s agreement. They applied for a grant and, with free paint from a well-known paint company under its international community campaign, let&#8217;s colour, transformed the market area.</p><p>Ideas for the decoration of the shop fronts and the walls of the market came from local schoolchildren, youngsters attending workshops at the BIG Project summer programme and sessions at the young carers project. The drawings and ideas became large-scale, vibrant mural works painted by a large group of volunteers. Nearly two years later, there has been little in the way of vandalism.</p><p>Another success is the BIG Project&#8217;s choir, which put Broomhouse on the map when it sang at the opening of the Olympic games and the reception to present Sir Chris Hoy with the freedom of the city of Edinburgh. Then there is the fruit and vegetable shop that the strategy group operates. It has recently been refurbished as it gets ready to celebrate its 10th birthday.</p><p>All those initiatives have helped to turn Broomhouse around and, although it still has some of the problems that are associated with other inner-city areas, it no longer deserves the little Bosnia tag that it once had.</p><p>I agree with Stewart Stevenson that we must give communities the ability and support to regenerate their own areas.

I believe that three parts of it will be of interest to my constituents: part 3, which creates a tribunal to deal with disputes; part 4, which regulates letting agents; and part 6, which tackles private housing conditions. The creation of a new housing tribunal for the private rented sector has been welcomed by the Chartered Institute of Housing, which stated that it was</p><p>&#8220;a new, specialist and more modern approach to dispute resolution&#8221;</p><p>and that</p><p>&#8220;Neither tenants nor landlords in the&#8221;</p><p>private rented sector</p><p>&#8220;see the current sheriff court system as user friendly or efficient&#8221;.</p><p>The Law Society of Scotland has also approved of</p><p>&#8220;the transfer of the sheriff&#8217;s jurisdiction to the first tier tribunal&#8221;,</p><p>a change that will result in 700 cases per year being removed from the sheriff court system.</p><p>Although the aim of part 3 is to provide better access to justice for tenants and landlords where disputes arise, Inclusion Scotland has highlighted that</p><p>&#8220;some private tenants may be reluctant to take issues to the tribunal because of fear of reprisals by landlords; that there will need to be exemptions to any tribunal fees for those who cannot afford to pay; and that certain people with protected characteristics, including disabled people, may need support to participate effectively in proceedings.&#8221;</p><p>Part 3 will also allow local authorities to report a landlord to the Private Rented Housing Panel for failing to comply with the repairing standard that landlords are required to meet in order to rent out their property. Previously only tenants could refer a landlord to the panel, but many were reluctant to do so for fear of losing their tenancy.</p><p>Part 4 might go some way towards alleviating some of Inclusion Scotland's concerns with regard to landlords by establishing a mandatory register of letting agents, with those applying to be on the register required to meet a fit and proper person test. The aim of such a test, which already exists in the landlord registration scheme, is to weed out anyone who has committed any offence involving fraud, dishonesty, violence, drugs, discrimination, firearms or sexual offences or who has failed to comply with housing legislation.</p><p>This section will also create a statutory code of practice and a dispute resolution procedure for letting agents and tenants. The committee recommends that the Scottish Government considers how it might include details in the bill relating to professional conduct, qualifications needed to be a letting agent, training for staff and how their financial obligations should be handled.</p><p>Part 6 ensures that local authorities have a range of powers to tackle poor conditions in the private sector. The last Scottish house condition survey that looked at this issue in detail estimated that there were &#163;223&#160;million-worth of essential improvements outstanding in the private rented sector across Scotland.</p><p>The bill provides a discretionary power to local authorities in order to support owners of communal blocks to carry out repairs by allowing the council to pay the missing share and recovering the outstanding sum later from the owner who is either unable or unwilling to pay. How effective that will be will depend on the individual local authority&#8217;s view on its available funding, the difficulty in recovering outstanding money and the timescale for that recovery.</p><p>In Edinburgh, the council is owed &#163;22&#160;million by up to 3,500 property owners for work that was carried out to their homes under the statutory notice system that previously existed. People need time to repay repair costs. However, the suggested 30-year repayment period is excessive and will mean that local authorities might consider not making use of the discretionary power. That will not help the many families and individuals who live in poor housing conditions and I therefore hope that the minister will consider the committee&#8217;s recommendation that</p><p>&#8220;local authorities should be given the flexibility to determine the time period over which the share must be paid back based on individual circumstances.&#8221;</p><p>If accepted, that change will, I hope, encourage local authorities to make use of the power in order to assist private rented sector tenants to have their homes improved.</p><p>Finally, the ending of the right to buy was supported by 83 per cent of all respondents, including 81 per cent of councils, 92 per cent of registered social landlords, 73 per cent of individuals and 75 per cent of tenants groups.

We can feel the air hum with virtual activity and reality transform before our very eyes. The pace of change is so fast that even the technology of five years ago seems prehistoric ... students probably do not even remember a time when phones were not smart, when cameras contained film, when texts meant school books, and when wireless referred to an old-fashioned radio!&#8221;</p><p>Within that pace of change there is a problem and an opportunity. The problem is that, across Europe, the number of computing graduates is stagnating, and the number of ICT professionals leaving for retirement is on the rise. The European parliamentary research service estimated that, over the next few years, Europe is facing a shortage of ICT professionals, with up to 900,000 unfilled vacancies across Europe. The same research also highlighted the opportunity in that:</p><p>&#8220;This young generation has grown up in the digital era, making them engaged and confident ICT-users. However, not enough students choose ICT-related subjects, with the number of computer science graduates dropping since 2005. Meanwhile, the ICT sector keeps growing by 3% every year.&#8221;</p><p>It is against that background of opportunity that I welcome the recent publication of the skills investment plan, produced by Skills Development Scotland, which is designed to encourage more people to train as ICT professionals, especially among our young.</p><p>The skills investment plan recognises that the Scottish ICT and digital technologies sector is thriving and that, between 2010 and 2013, the number of businesses operating in the sector increased to 6,500, employing 73,000 people and delivering &#163;3 billion to the Scottish economy. The purpose of the skills investment plan is to co-ordinate the response from industry, education and Government in order to address the key IT skills shortages, focusing on the need for programmers and web designers and identifying the investment needed to tackle the issue.</p><p>Scotland is seen as a key player in areas such as big data, informatics and digital health but, if we are to retain that status, we need to continue to raise awareness of the employment opportunities that are available in the sector and to encourage more young people to study computer-related subjects.</p><p>What has been happening to address the issue? In our schools, curriculum for excellence gives young people opportunities to develop their understanding and skills by taking computing as a specialist subject. The number of young people who are undertaking the information technology professional modern apprenticeship has grown substantially in the past two years. Our universities continue to produce thousands of ICT graduates every year, and new degree courses are planned by the University of Stirling, in partnership with Forth Valley College.</p><p>The recent Scottish Government announcement of funding of &#163;6.6 million to support digital skills and help to implement the skills investment plan will assist in the development of an industry-led digital skills academy, to support demand for up to 11,000 jobs per year.</p><p>To encourage students to consider a career in the IT sector, Edinburgh Napier University, in partnership with other public bodies, is delivering the e-placement Scotland programme, which encourages universities and employers to create more industrial placements in IT.

The people of Gaza are prevented from cooking, flushing toilets or washing their hands. With water running out, the threat of disease is very real.</p><p>However, we need to put the events into their proper historical context. As one of the foremost experts on the Israel-Palestine conflict, Avi Shlaim, has said in relation to the Israeli occupation of the west bank and Gaza post-1967:</p><p>&#8220;The aim was to establish Greater Israel through permanent political, economic and military control over the Palestinian territories.

We must remember that the right to buy led to a significant reduction in the number of houses that are available for rent. Over the years, since it was introduced, the right to buy has greatly diminished the amount of housing stock of good quality that is available for rent to families throughout Scotland. We have a duty to provide homes of good quality for all families, including those who cannot afford to buy. The abolition of the right to buy will ensure that better properties in the more desirable areas will no longer be sold off, reducing the number of homes that are available for social rent. The abolition of the right to buy is long overdue, which is why it has been widely welcomed across Scotland. It will enhance social housing and protect the investment that is made in it.</p><p>I want to nail the lie that the Government&#8217;s record is anything other than a good one. The Government is outperforming the previous Labour-Liberal Democrat Administration&#8217;s record on council house building. Since 2007-08, 4,618 new council homes have been completed, compared with only six under the previous Administration. In fairness to James Kelly, whenever the issue has been raised in the chamber, he has always pointed to the fact that that statistic ignores the number of housing association homes that were completed. However, the SNP Government&#8217;s record in that area is also impressive. Since 2007-08, 30,292 housing association homes have been completed, which represents a rise of 12 per cent on the 27,000 homes that were completed under the Labour-Liberal Democrat Administration.</p><p>The bill has been greatly enhanced and strengthened by the improvements that have been made during its passage through Parliament. In a number of key areas, the Government has worked with stakeholders and MSPs from across the chamber to strengthen the bill. The Minister for Housing and Welfare, Margaret Burgess, deserves credit for the positive way in which she has entered into constructive dialogue on a range of issues. She has been willing to listen to and reflect on the arguments that have been presented to her, and the bill is better as a consequence of the approach that she has taken.</p><p>I am particularly grateful to the minister for meeting me and my colleague Alex Rowley to discuss temporary accommodation for homeless families. We were both concerned as a result of representations that we received from Shelter Scotland that, although the number of homeless families being placed in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation had reduced significantly since changes to legislation were introduced in 2004, a number of families, particularly pregnant women and children, were still being placed by some local authorities&#8212;by no means all&#8212;in accommodation that, to be frank, was not suitable for human habitation and was unacceptable in a civilised society.</p><p>The outcome of our discussions is that the Government will amend the Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order 2004 to include a reference to accommodation being wind and watertight. The amended order will provide further clarity to local councils regarding the provision of temporary accommodation. All people, regardless of what type of accommodation they find themselves in, have a right to enjoy their lives in comfort, safety and dignity. I look forward to the amended order coming into force by the end of the year to achieve that. I very much welcome the progress that has been made on that during the bill&#8217;s passage. I am grateful to Alex Rowley for his support and to Shelter Scotland for its expertise on the issue.</p><p>I was also grateful for the opportunity to meet the minister along with Sarah Boyack to discuss a number of issues on behalf of the City of Edinburgh Council. As a result of that meeting, the Government introduced further changes in relation to the recovery of costs under a repayment charge that will allow local authorities to determine a repayment period of between five and 30 years and provide a right of appeal for any person who is aggrieved by the period of the charge.</p><p>The final area on which progress has been made is making carbon monoxide detectors mandatory in the private rented sector. Again, I am pleased to have worked with Shelter Scotland to bring about that change and I am glad that the Parliament has acted to address the issue so that all private tenants can feel safe from the threat of that so-called silent killer.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>What steps is the cabinet secretary taking to ensure that the expansion of modern apprenticeships is properly aligned with the skills that are required to support economic growth, as Sir Ian Wood recommended?

Scottish universities have an excellent track record of attracting international students and have a teaching and research offer that allows them to compete successfully in a fiercely competitive global recruitment environment.</p><p>Scotland derives huge social, economic and cultural benefit from the 28,500 international students who study in our 19 universities and higher education institutions. Universities Scotland estimates the economic impact of international students in Scotland to be &#163;337 million every year in fees and &#163;441 million in off-campus expenditure.</p><p>As the MSP for Edinburgh Southern, I am incredibly privileged to represent not one but two of Edinburgh&#8217;s world-class universities: the University of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Napier University, both of which have campuses in my constituency. More than 30 per cent of Edinburgh Napier University&#8217;s student population is international and the University of Edinburgh has perhaps the largest total cohort of international students in Scotland. According to the University of Edinburgh&#8217;s annual review of 2012-13, 12 per cent of its students are domiciled in the EU, excluding the UK, and 27 per cent are internationally domiciled, excluding the EU.</p><p>One of the strengths of the higher education sector in Scotland, which contributes to Scotland having some of the world&#8217;s top-ranking universities, is its ability to attract and retain some of the finest academics and researchers from around the world.</p><p>Scotland performs very well in foreign direct investment, leading the way in the UK on projects and jobs created outside London. Our universities are among the key pull factors that contribute to Scotland&#8217;s attractiveness to investors. Their key outputs of skills and research are cited by almost half of companies as a key reason for their investment in Scotland.</p><p>As the MSP for two universities, I will highlight the effect of UK immigration policy on higher education in Scotland. The university sector in Scotland speaks with one clear voice that the UK&#8217;s regressive policy on student immigration and its obsession with lowering immigration from outside the EU presents a real and immediate threat to the entire higher education sector in Scotland. It is encouraging that, on that point, there appears to be consensus across the Parliament.</p><p>Universities Scotland makes the point forcefully:</p><p>&#8220;The UK&#8217;s visa regime is now significantly more restrictive than that applied by a range of competitor nations who are vigorously seeking to attract talented learners from around the world. This places the UK, including Scotland, at a competitive disadvantage.&#8221;</p><p>Key competitors, such as the United States, Canada and Australia, have continued to expand their international student numbers, as Liam McArthur acknowledged. Between 2011-12 and 2012-13, international student numbers in three other key English-speaking university markets increased, with 0.4 per cent growth in Australia, 7 per cent growth in the United States and 11 per cent growth in Canada.</p><p>The fact is that the number of first-year international students studying at Scottish universities has fallen significantly. According to the UK Higher Education Statistics Authority, applications from India fell by 58 per cent, those from Pakistan fell by 38 per cent and those from Nigeria fell by 22 per cent. That fall in admissions from some of the most important emerging economies in the world not only places a stranglehold on a valuable revenue stream for Scottish universities but threatens to damage Scotland&#8217;s well-deserved and hard-earned international reputation.</p><p>It is ironic that a recent Universities UK survey of international student recruitment offices in higher education institutions throughout the UK found that only 30 per cent of Scottish institutions were meeting their own targets for international student recruitment. That demonstrates that the capacity exists within institutions to recruit higher numbers of international students but the current policy environment does not support that ambition.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s white paper pledges to take a different approach to immigration from that of the Westminster Government. The Scottish Government quite rightly sees immigration as an aid to healthy population growth in Scotland.</p><p>Unlike those on the far right of politics, I do not believe that Scotland is full. Our immigration policy and our attitude towards international students should reflect our values as a welcoming and inclusive modern country.</p><p>Reflecting on the UK&#8217;s policy of curbing the entry of international students, Professor Anton Muscatelli, the principal of the University of Glasgow, stated:</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a message that says &#8216;don't come here, we&#8217;re closed for business, closed for education&#8217; ... It&#8217;s exactly the opposite message that a number of other countries are sending, including the US, Canada and Australia. I don't think we should be there as a country.&#8221;</p><p>Given the positive benefits to Scotland&#8217;s economy, culture and society from international students, the impact that our universities make across the world and Scotland&#8217;s reputation as a country that welcomes with an open mind and open arms those from overseas, I cannot but agree whole-heartedly with Professor Muscatelli.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Immigration Policy (Higher Education)"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/25084.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "image_width": 101, "person_id": "25084", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Jim Eadie", "member_id": "80441", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Edinburgh Southern"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Colin", "last_name": "Keir", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p></p><p>8.

All through the year, up and down the country, a local festival can usually be found. As the cabinet secretary said, 2014 could be the greatest year that we have had for events, culture and sport.</p><p>As the MSP for the Edinburgh Western constituency, I am delighted that the debate is happening at the same time as the world&#8217;s best and most famous culture extravaganza&#8212;the Edinburgh festivals. For that reason, and with respect to festivals across the country, I will, like Sarah Boyack, focus my comments on Edinburgh. That is only because lessons that are learned in the capital can help other areas.</p><p>As a resident of the capital, I have grown to love the atmosphere, the colour, the diversity and the opportunities that present themselves at this time of year. However, only after I was elected to the City of Edinburgh Council did I become aware of how vital the Edinburgh festivals are to the economy of the city and beyond.</p><p>The global reach of the Edinburgh festivals is phenomenal. We can consider the amount of free international advertising that Edinburgh and Scotland obtain when shots of the castle, Princes Street or the Royal Mile are shown on television screens around the world. It would probably take the Scottish Government&#8217;s entire block grant to pay for the equivalent advertising space globally.</p><p>The 2013 review of Edinburgh&#8217;s festival fringe said that there were 45,465 performances in 273 venues by 2,402 companies, which included some 24,107 performers from 41 countries. Those figures are just for the fringe; when the official festival, the book festival and others are included, we can see how successful the festival is.</p><p>The festivals must overcome logistical problems, some of which are similar to those that Glasgow overcame recently during its magnificent Commonwealth games. Local authority transport officials will have to deal anyway with issues of transport management, particularly from the west of the city to the city centre, but things can get crazy during festival time, when thousands of performers and visitors come to the city.</p><p>Another problem is festival inflation, whereby accommodation costs soar as lodgings become more difficult to obtain. That is one of the main problems that festivals have in achieving sustainability. If they are not to be seen as elitist and if they are to allow people to break through into the performing arts, to show exhibitions and to be able to see shows, we must find a way of keeping the costs down.</p><p>Another plus side to the festival is Edinburgh airport obtaining more direct flights. As Edinburgh becomes more accessible, it is vital that we identify and address the logistical problems.</p><p>On the less glamorous side are performance costs and venue safety. When I was the convener of the City of Edinburgh Council&#8217;s regulatory committee, one of the most difficult things that I had to do was find ways of keeping the cost of public entertainment licences down.</p><p>The arts, culture and sport should not be only for those who have money. I am delighted that the Scottish Government&#8217;s expo fund has helped with increased investment of &#163;2.25&#160;million from 2012, which has helped to lever in another &#163;1.5&#160;million from other sources.</p><p>In terms of strategy, there has been much success in that the advertising and sales pitch for the Edinburgh festivals has been linked with other events including the Commonwealth games and the Olympic games. The events are working not in isolation but in partnership, and are feeding off each other and offering tourists an option that allows them to take in many events around the whole country&#8212;not just in Edinburgh. That is an example of team Scotland in action.</p><p>Although Edinburgh&#8217;s and Scotland&#8217;s festivals are absolutely first class, there cannot be room for complacency. As has been mentioned numerous times today, the City of Edinburgh Council commissioned the &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; report back in 2006. The threat from emerging festivals throughout the UK and Europe in terms of artistic prestige, patronage, affordability and accessibility required to be looked at seriously. I welcome the news that the festivals forum will review how things are done.</p><p>In the years since the &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; report was published, the City of Edinburgh Council, Festivals Edinburgh and the individual festivals have taken up the challenge. I will mention five of the many people who have worked to maintain Edinburgh&#8217;s prominence as the world&#8217;s leading festival city. Faith Liddell is the director of Festivals Edinburgh, whose work brings together in a coherent unit the festivals here in the city. Kath Mainland is the chief executive officer of Edinburgh Festival Fringe, whose magnificent work earned her a CBE in the Queen&#8217;s birthday honours this year. If ever anyone was perfectly placed in a job, it is Kath Mainland.</p><p>Other members have mentioned Sir Jonathan Mills, who has left his mark on the festival over the years. In addition I must mention two local politicians&#8212;that is not something that we hear very often in the chamber. The first is the Edinburgh festival and events champion, Councillor Steve Cardownie. It is fair to say that Councillor Cardownie has developed a sometimes controversial image in the city, including through playing a cadaver in a Ukrainian play at the festival some years ago. However, his work over a number of years has shown an incredible commitment to the Edinburgh festivals&#8217; profile at home and abroad. I also commend Councillor Eric Milligan, from the Labour group, who has shown the same passion for the festival, for a number of years.</p><p>I am deeply proud to have been involved with many people who are a part of the festival. We can look forward to many successful years of Scotland&#8217;s festivals, and not just in Edinburgh.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p></p><p>12.

As Drew Smith pointed out, Hamas is certainly not blameless in the conflict. I condemn its rocket attacks, but the effect of Israel&#8217;s operation protective edge has shown how abhorrent and indiscriminate warfare can become.</p><p>Amnesty International claims that war crimes have been committed by both sides, but the hammer that is the Israeli military offensive is so scattergun in its approach that the effects are a shock to any person who watches TV or reads media reports. Indeed, some of the images that can be seen on social media are so harrowing that they simply could not be televised.</p><p>We keep on being told that we live in an age in which warfare is computerised and targeted. That makes the bombing of UN schools or youngsters who are playing football on a beach all the more disgusting.</p><p>Others have pointed out that it is not the first time that Israel has carried out that type of offensive. There is absolutely no moral justification for the actions. It is clear that, if it was a moral war, most of the world would believe that Israel is losing.</p><p>Indiscriminate violence against those who cannot defend themselves is simply not acceptable in the modern world. I support the Scottish Government in its calls for a UN investigation to be held and the offer of financial and medical assistance. It will be interesting to see whether there is a mechanism that may allow the International Criminal Court to play a part in future.</p><p>Today&#8217;s Save the Children briefing gives stark figures. It says:</p><p>&#8220;One in four Palestinians killed since the conflict in Gaza began is a child.&#8221;</p><p>Schools and hospitals are damaged or destroyed, and shelter is now required for around 300,000 people. There must be infrastructure development.

The Israelis then review the proposal, a process that is supposed to take not more than two months but on average takes nearly 20 months.&#8221;</p><p>That is an absolutely silly situation to be in.</p><p>International pressure really must be put on Israel to lift the blockade and work tirelessly towards the two-state solution.</p><p>Finally, the UK Government must take a stand.

Every single person will have a view of what that legacy is, and I suspect that nobody will be wrong.</p><p>These Commonwealth games were a showcase for Glasgow and Scotland, and they certainly did not let us down. There were the Clyde-siders, and the personal hardship stories from the likes of Lynsey Sharp and Libby Clegg. Eilidh Child handled the pressure of being the poster girl of the games, and who will forget the wonderful smile and look of sheer happiness shown by 13-year-old swimmer Erraid Davies?</p><p>Those are some of the stories that made the games, which were simply magnificent. I add my congratulations to everyone who was involved. Of course, there was much more to the games than just competition, and the question is, what do we do now that they are finished?</p><p>As we know, the Scottish Government produced a games legacy document, which focused on building an active, connected, sustainable and flourishing Scotland, and covered every aspect of life.</p><p>Glasgow produced a games that was so enlightened that the world could not help but see that, in the 21st century, our nation stands tall. As a result of the actions that were taken by those participating in the whole event, this country did not need its politicians to stand up and inform the Commonwealth about what we as a nation feel about issues of community, equality and diversity. That alone would be a tremendous legacy for our latest Commonwealth games, but we can do more. We have issues with health, particularly in our cities, which could be helped if we could encourage people to rediscover exercise.</p><p>I am sure the irony of someone who is as overweight as I am lecturing on the dangers of obesity and diabetes is not lost on members. Perhaps it looks a tad hypocritical. However, if someone like me, who was privileged to receive international honours in his younger days, can let themselves go physically, how much easier it is for someone who has grown up with a bad diet and difficult circumstances to follow the wrong direction?</p><p>I commend initiatives such as the physical activity implementation plan in that respect, but the big issue will always be how to change people&#8217;s attitudes to exercise and health. Once we start to change attitudes, will we be able to get away from the perception that some people have that they need a pair of &#163;100 trainers to take part, or from the difficulties of taking part in sport without having to pay substantial amounts of money to use facilities? Sport and general exercise should not be out of bounds to anyone in our society.</p><p>On the legacy for elite sport, we should be delighted that the Scotland team achieved so much success. For many of the athletes, a medal or a personal best performance will be seen as a stepping stone to further success.</p><p>The sportscotland institute of sport is obviously starting to reap rewards, and I heartily commend the director of high performance, Mike Whittingham, and his team for the job that they are doing. I hope that there is constant review of what happens at the institute. Even the much-lauded and successful Australian institute of sport came under fire as the rest of the world caught up with Australia and elite performance levels were perceived to have dropped.</p><p>We also should identify young talent to help it through into elite competition. Although youngsters may find a sport and enjoy it at around the age of nine or 10 years, it is important to offer other options. Not only might they find something new that they like, but I would like to think that there may be a talent-spotting method to encourage youngsters who may be physically more suited to another sport, perhaps in their teens, to move to a discipline in which they may achieve elite success. I believe that that was done in United Kingdom rowing a few years ago on a larger scale and is common practice in countries such as Australia.</p><p>There is one other thing: team Scotland achieved remarkable results at the Commonwealth games, but that is the top level at which our country can compete. In most sports&#8212;athletics is the perfect example&#8212;our athletes must challenge for places in a Great Britain team to compete at the highest level: the world and European championships and the Olympics. That usually means that fewer athletes are able to compete at the top level.</p><p>Is it a coincidence that we have had less international success in long-distance running since Scotland stopped sending a team to the world cross-country championships 30 years ago, for instance? The biggest legacy at elite level will be to see our Scottish teams compete at the highest level, but I am afraid to say that&#8212;to bring a little bit of politics into the matter&#8212;the only chance that that can ever happen is with a yes vote on 18 September.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>I congratulate Cameron Buchanan on bringing this debate to the chamber.</p><p>Nothing comes to my inbox more often than the strategic plan and the effects of the proposed local development plan. It is the thing that we have to deal with in the constituency office. I find myself in agreement with Cameron Buchanan&#8217;s speech; there is also much to what Sarah Boyack said.</p><p>In my constituency, consultation by the City of Edinburgh Council has been nothing short of abysmal. There is also a feeling that deals have been done. Local people, particularly in Cammo and Maybury, have no faith in the process, simply because of the dismal way in which the City of Edinburgh Council has handled their objections.</p><p>In a recent Evening News article, John McLellan mentioned that something like one quarter of the total number of objections to the local development plan deal with the western part of Edinburgh. That is because the traffic and environmental situation in that area is dire. The Queensferry Road corridor, particularly Barnton, and the Corstorphine Road corridor, particularly Maybury, and St John&#8217;s Road, are some of the most polluted areas in the United Kingdom. Despite that, some planner has decided that, although there are fields available and plenty of space for development, the main issues report need propose absolutely no plans to show how the infrastructure will support development, both in those areas and along the corridors of two of the busiest roads in Edinburgh.</p><p>I feel that I have to support my constituents. For many years, there has been talk about the transport and pollution problems in those areas, yet despite various questions there are still plans that cover transport from Newbridge to Maybury but no further. A common response is, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it; the tram will deal with that.&#8221; The tram will not deal with that.</p><p>The transport assessments are, quite frankly, unbelievable, on the ground that they say that they can mitigate against future growth in traffic, when in fact the problem is here, right now. I hope that the minister listens to what is being said. I know that the City of Edinburgh Council has a difficult decision to make. Nobody is denying that there is a housing shortage in the area, but we cannot just dump houses down and hope that the roads will support the amount of traffic that goes along them. Maybury and Cammo have serious problems and East Craigs is in a shocking position, as it has only one road out, on to Maybury Road, which has two of the busiest junctions, at Barnton and Maybury.</p><p>The City of Edinburgh Council has done nothing to discuss the problems with people and come up with solutions. We have held public meetings, but nobody believes what is being said about strategic planning, because they feel that the information that has come back to them is way off the mark. I make a plea to the City of Edinburgh Council to start getting its act together to do the work that it must do to convince people that the houses that are required can go into those areas.</p><p>Queensferry is another area that has just been told that 1,000 more houses will be thrown down there. There has been no consultation. It is absolutely abysmal. Before I carry on and get into greater degrees of problems with my council colleagues, I will simply reiterate that there are difficulties, as Cameron Buchanan said. I appreciate Sarah Boyack&#8217;s efforts in arranging the meeting that took place but, as has been pointed out and as people saw at the meeting, the convener did not have any real answers. That is the difficulty that we face.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Strategic Planning (Lothians)"}, {"date": "2014-06-12", "body": "<p>There is something deeply satisfying about cash coming from the criminal fraternity and heading back into society. We have all been speaking about that, and many have mentioned it. We have to look at the fact that it is doing a lot of good, despite some of our differences about evaluation and some of the things that have been taken on. This has been a particularly useful debate.</p><p>I was very interested indeed in Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s contribution, given that he is in a neighbouring constituency to mine. Some of the cashback money has been focused on that area of Edinburgh that perhaps has seen better times and most certainly has a better future. Some of the initiatives in that area should be commended.</p><p>I am delighted to have been called to speak in this debate because it gives me the chance to talk about a couple of projects in my area. We have gone through the figures and I do not want to regurgitate what has been said already. One of the areas that is very close to Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s area&#8212;the council ward covers parts of both constituencies&#8212;is Muirhouse Forth ward, which contains the north Edinburgh arts centre, run by Kate Wimpress. The other day, she was gushing to me about what has been done through cashback for communities. The NEA demo fund was awarded &#163;7,870 for a project that allowed five unpublished solo artists or bands up to the age of 25 to record professionally mastered demo tracks and create links with industry experts, thereby increasing access to further education opportunities.</p><p>When we think about such initiatives, we should remember that it is not just about communities but about individuals. One of those individuals, Calum Cummins, a production volunteer and artist, said:</p><p>&#8220;The demo fund gave me the kind of specialist support which encouraged my development both as a youth worker, musician and artist and gave me valuable experience which will hopefully help me move towards my goal of taking on a professional role in the creative industries.&#8221;</p><p>The other project, the Muirhouse youth development group ruffin it project, gained just over &#163;25,000. The project engaged young people from the Forth ward area, which I share with Malcolm Chisholm. The area has seen lower levels of engagement with the arts, as was found through a taking part survey. The project encouraged greater participation to inspire people&#8217;s lives and that of the extended community. Through film-making, the project provided a range of opportunities for young people to input creatively. A short film entitled &#8220;Ruffin&#8217; it in Muirhouse&#8221; was created and screened to more than 200 people at NEA and the Filmhouse in October 2013.</p><p>That project aimed to support the health and wellbeing of young people by getting them involved with and participating in film-making. It provided them with a platform to air their reflections on life, and contributed to their overall wellbeing and sense of self. It filled a gap in provision by creating opportunities for intergenerational work between older and younger community members and, through work with ethnic minority young people, encouraging greater community cohesion. It is a fine piece of work.</p><p>Perhaps the most exciting part of those two examples, which have happened thanks to cashback for communities, is the sense of achievement that comes from having the confidence to try. Personal development is the key to cashback for communities. It really does work and it should be highlighted.</p><p>Many people have talked about basketball. It is not a sport that I know terribly well, but it turns out that my community sports hub, which I believe that the cabinet secretary has visited on a few occasions, at the Forrester and St Augustine&#8217;s complex, is one of the centres for basketball. I spoke to Chris Dodds, a senior officer at basketballscotland, which is sited at the Gyle in my constituency, who gushed forth about what cashback does for sports in the local community.</p><p>One of the issues that came up in the Health and Sport Committee some time ago was the participation of girls under 16 in sport. Therefore, it was fantastic for me to hear that, through cashback, basketballscotland is able to run programmes that encourage girls under 16 to participate and a record number of young girls are taking up the sport. Given the debate that we had on that issue a few months ago, I think that is fantastic. It is a real success story. Given all the other elements, such as creating team spirit and community spirit and bringing in kids from areas that have seen better days, whoever thought this project up had a light bulb moment, as Maureen Watt said. It really has been absolutely fantastic.</p><p>I see that my time is running a little bit short, so I commend the motion from the cabinet secretary.

The campaign called a fair tax on flying is an alliance of over 30 airlines, airports, tour operators and destination and travel trade associations who are all calling on the UK Government to make UK aviation tax fairer. When we add to that group people of the same mind about APD, such as those in chambers of commerce&#8212;for example, Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce&#8212;we see that the opinion that there is something wrong with APD is shared widely.</p><p>APD was introduced in 1994, I believe on the back of being an environmental tax, but it is certainly not that now; it is just a tax&#8212;nobody claims that it is even close to being an environmental tax. It started off at just &#163;5 for short air journeys and &#163;10 for going elsewhere. Now, of course, the UK has an APD rate that a World Economic Forum report of last year stated was the world&#8217;s highest.</p><p>We have seen over the past couple of years the publication of the PWC report&#8212;incidentally, it was written by people who used to work in the UK Treasury&#8212;and the York Aviation report that was commissioned by Scottish airports. As Mr Johnstone pointed out, Scottish airports have had some pretty good figures, which are in spite of APD and come from a demand for more direct flights. Investment in the airports is due to the hard work of the people who run them, who are looking for route development. We have had success in Scottish airports from that, but we could do even better. As the MSP whose constituency includes Edinburgh airport, I believe that it is a driver for the economy. Everyone in the business sector accepts that. We need to encourage the airport, because we need jobs and to get the economy moving, and we can do that through the aviation industry.</p><p>Given what we have heard so far from a number of people, we can see the economic difficulties that those in the aviation industry are faced with. I have explained that in terms of Edinburgh airport. Indeed, as the minister pointed out, Saad Hammad, the chief executive of Flybe, has commented:</p><p>&#8220;Across the aviation industry, scrapping Air Passenger Duty would not only incentivise airlines to provide new routes and enhance travel for Scotland&#8217;s passengers, it would also significantly boost business and the economy. Scottish business people and consumers have had to count the cost of paying this tax twice when travelling domestically to an English airport &#8212; a disproportionate financial penalty which must not be allowed to continue.&#8221;</p><p>That shows that it is not just us who criticise APD. I know that operators in the Airport Operators Association, which is UK wide, and particularly those in the north of England, in Newcastle and Manchester for example, are all saying the same thing about APD, which is what makes the comments that some members of the Labour Party have made today even more worrying. I am sure that they will be sending shivers down the backs of those in the aviation industry, because it is looking for support. That simple fact is evidenced by the comments of many people in the industry.</p><p>As has been said, Scottish business people and consumers generally have had to count the cost of paying the APD tax twice. The crux of the matter is that we in Scotland have a geographical and airport hub problem that means that we end up paying APD twice.</p><p>APD is nothing more than Westminster&#8217;s demand for a tax; as I have said, it is not a green tax. It is a constant source of amazement that so far the Chancellor of the Exchequer has failed to respond to the pleas of business leaders such as Richard Branson of Virgin Atlantic, Willie Walsh of British Airways, Carolyn McCall of easyJet, Saad Hammad of Flybe and Michael O&#8217;Leary of Ryanair to stop trying to make their businesses uncompetitive in an incredibly difficult market.</p><p>And uncompetitive they are. Competition is not just between carriers and airports but between nations. As the minister mentioned, a family of four from here going on holiday to Florida would pay &#163;276 in APD, whereas an equivalent family in Germany flying to the same destination would pay &#163;154. As Graeme Dey pointed out, the Republic of Ireland has scrapped the APD tax. Scotland was promised by the Calman commission that APD would be devolved to it. APD got devolved to Northern Ireland in an attempt to make it more competitive with Dublin. What difference is there between Belfast versus Dublin and Belfast versus Glasgow? We are talking airplanes here.</p><p>APD has put Scotland at a competitive disadvantage, but Westminster demands to hold on to it and it appears that the Labour Party, having seen a bit of merit in the devolution of powers, is no longer terribly happy&#8212;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Air Passenger Duty"}, {"date": "2014-06-03", "body": "<p>I would have thought that the complete infrastructure of business is relevant, including travel, ticketing, services that are provided and the amount of money that people may well spend with their families as they are waiting on a flight.

For many people, August in Edinburgh is inexorably linked to the Edinburgh festivals and the excitement and energy that they bring. They electrify every nook and cranny of the city. The festival of politics will, of course, open tomorrow in the Parliament.</p><p>I would also like to take the opportunity to celebrate the many festivals that take place throughout the year across Scotland, which add just as much inspiration, colour and joy to our lives.</p><p>I am sure that members will share my belief that this is the perfect time to reflect on the great success of festival 2014 in Glasgow, which ran alongside the Commonwealth games, and the on-going work of culture 2014 across Scotland, which will run until the end of August. Both have done much to share the great cultural riches of the Commonwealth across all Scotland through dance, song, theatre, literature, music, visual art, comedy and much more. Indeed, although 2014 will be remembered as a momentous year for many reasons, we should not forget that it has, arguably, been the greatest year ever for Scotland&#8217;s festivals.</p><p>The Edinburgh festivals have woven their way into the very fabric of the city to such an extent that it is sometimes almost too easy to take them for granted. Throughout the year, the festivals bring Edinburgh alive for residents and visitors alike, as the city hosts more than 25,000 international artists, more than 1,000 accredited media, and audiences of more than 4 million. That benefit is felt far beyond Edinburgh. The economic, cultural and social value of the festivals generates &#163;261 million to the Scottish economy, with &#163;41 million spent on accommodation and &#163;37 million spent in our cafes and bars.</p><p>We know that 77 per cent of visitors from outside Scotland said that the festivals made them more likely to visit Edinburgh again in the future. That means that the festivals are one of the country&#8217;s great tourism gateways. They open visitors&#8217; eyes to our wider tourism offer, and they benefit businesses and communities across the whole country.</p><p>We must not forget that Edinburgh&#8217;s festivals are a source of astonishing opportunity and inspiration for our artists as well. They provide them with the platform to develop, present and promote their work in perhaps the greatest showcase of international performing arts and culture in the world.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s Edinburgh festivals expo fund supports the costs of new productions, events or exhibitions that involve Scotland-based participants and are premiered at any of the 12 Edinburgh festivals. This year, a total of &#163;2.25 million will take the overall level of investment to &#163;14 million since 2008.</p><p>The Edinburgh festivals are a platform for the wider world. I recently enjoyed a Mandela day performance at the jazz and blues festival in which the incredible Mahotella Queens from South Africa held the audience in rapture with their vocal harmonies and age-defying dancing. If I tell members that the Mahotella Queens were founded in the year in which I was born, that may give them a perspective. I also heard young people from townships near Cape Town perform jazz as part of Artscape&#8217;s youth band. We hope to work more with them.</p><p>We are not resting on our laurels. I am pleased that the festivals forum, which includes key Edinburgh festivals stakeholders, will undertake a new forward-thinking study to consider the future sustainability, success and development of Edinburgh&#8217;s major festivals.</p><p>I want to recognise and pay tribute to Sir Jonathan Mills in his final year as director of the Edinburgh international festival. I welcome Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s amendment, which mentions him. It is fitting that he has just successfully overseen the second international culture summit in the Parliament, because throughout his stewardship he has not only brought many memorable productions together but shown great leadership in keeping the founding spirit of the Edinburgh international festival alive. He will leave a strong and lasting legacy, and I am sure that all members join me in wishing his successor Fergus Linehan great success in his tenure.</p><p>It is, of course, important that we appreciate the full spectrum of festivals and events that make Scotland such a vibrant place to live in and to visit, with our cities, towns and villages playing host to well over 200 festivals each year. From Up Helly Aa in Shetland to this year&#8217;s Royal National M&#242;d in Inverness and the Peebles arts festival in the Scottish Borders, festivals and events cover the length and breadth of Scotland all year round.</p><p>I enjoyed speaking at the launch of this year&#8217;s Glasgow comedy festival, which this year marked its 12th birthday and has emerged as the biggest event of its kind in Europe, with more than 100,000 tickets on offer for over 400 shows in nearly 50 venues. I was also delighted to attend several events at this year&#8217;s 21st Celtic Connections festival in Glasgow, which truly came of age with a vibrant programme that celebrated not only the incredible array of traditional and contemporary Scottish music, but also its connections to cultures around the world.</p><p>Some of our most vibrant and exciting festivals are our music festivals, which are as diverse in their styles and genres as they are wide in their reach. I recently had the pleasure of attending the St Magnus international festival in Orkney, where I attended a remarkable lute concert in the magical setting of the Italian chapel. I am sure that Liam McArthur will join me in noting the success of this year&#8217;s Orkney folk festival, which is an exemplar of the collaborative, community approach that lies at the heart of so many of our festivals.</p><p>It is also an opportune time to congratulate perhaps our premier music festival, T in the Park. In what was a landmark year with brilliant performances from Paolo Nutini and Biffy Clyro, not only did the event turn 21 but it saw the last ever festival to be held at Balado come to an emotional close in front of 85,000 festival goers&#8212;including my 17-year-old son, in what is now seen as a rite-of-passage event in Scotland.</p><p>This has also been a momentous year with Scotland embracing the Commonwealth games. The Commonwealth games highlights, which were published this very morning, report on the games being the largest multisport and cultural event to be held in Scotland in a generation, with Glasgow being transformed to provide a festival of culture for its games-time visitors.</p><p>Alongside the sporting action, the Glasgow 2014 cultural programme is a national programme of new work by world-leading and emerging Scottish and international artists&#8212;the most ambitious national cultural celebration that has ever taken place in Scotland.</p><p>I congratulate Glasgow Life, Creative Scotland and all the other partners who worked so hard to bring the festival together, as well as the partnerships that have been formed throughout Scotland to help to deliver the Scotland-wide programme. By the close of the programme on 31 August, around 1,500 events will have taken place involving thousands of artists, performers and participants across hundreds of locations and venues the length and breadth of Scotland.</p><p>The nationwide culture 2014 strand has showcased the best of Scotland&#8217;s rich and vibrant cultural life. The year started with some stand-out performances including the premiere of the new music biennial commissions at Celtic Connections, the restaging of the National Theatre of Scotland&#8217;s &#8220;Glasgow Girls&#8221; and the celebration of diversity through Janice Parker&#8217;s &#8220;Glory&#8221;.</p><p>The get Scotland dancing initiative got thousands across the nation active. In May, the big dance pledge, which was created by Scottish Ballet, saw 67,000 people in 24 countries dance along to special choreography created by Scottish Ballet, including 250 dancers performing on the Skye bridge. I had the pleasure of seeing the big dance take place in my home town of Linlithgow, with 750 schoolchildren owning the square in my town. It was a great celebration of them as well as of the Commonwealth and of dance.</p><p>On midsummer&#8217;s day, people across the world joined hands in a global celebration of Scottish dance in the 24-hour Commonwealth ceilidh, and the get dancin&#8217; initiative is continuing to show that dance is for everyone, with free dance classes on offer in hundreds of locations across the country. It is recognition that, in terms of legacy, not everyone can be Usain Bolt or be an athlete, but everyone can dance, and the get Scotland dancing initiative is part of the activity to try to make sure that all of Scotland is active.</p><p>The Big Big Sing has inspired thousands of people to sign up to enjoy the health and wellbeing benefits of singing. I heard some choirs singing earlier today in the Parliament, and a great, infectious enthusiasm for choral singing has been seen both from international visitors and with the Big Big Sing inspiring people here in Scotland. The huge range of opportunities to take part included singing days, workshops and flash-mob choirs, culminating in a 14,000-strong crowd singing their hearts out on Glasgow Green on a Sunday in the rain during the big Big Big Sing, which I had the pleasure to join.</p><p>Of course, the visual art world has been well represented through the quite remarkable landmark &#8220;Generation&#8221; project: an incredible programme of exhibitions celebrating 25 years of contemporary art in Scotland that features more than 100 artists and takes place at over 70 venues the length and breadth of the country, exhibiting many of our Turner prize winners and so many artists who have contributed so much over that 25-year period. So far, I have seen shows by Walker and Bromwich in Orkney and exhibitions at the national galleries in Edinburgh, including works by Steven Campbell, Ciara Phillips and Alison Watt.</p><p>During the Commonwealth games, festival 2014 proved to be an enormous success, transforming Glasgow with an invigorating mix of entertainment, culture and enjoyment and filling the streets, spaces and stages of the city. When people said that Glasgow was buzzing during the games, a key part of that was the cultural vibrancy at almost every street corner. There were over three quarters of a million visits to the live zones at Glasgow Green, Kelvingrove band stand, the merchant city and the BBC at the quay, while more than 6,000 performers were involved in more than 1,000 performances in 100 venues around the city.</p><p>It was a hugely diverse programme. My personal highlight was &#8220;Boomerang&#8221;, which was a celebration of indigenous cultures with 21 artists from Scotland, New Zealand and Australia mixing Gaelic song and pipes with the haka, Maori vocals and traditional aboriginal music. The &#8220;Empire Caf&#233;&#8221;, based in the Briggait, explored Scotland&#8217;s relationship with the North Atlantic slave trade through a thought-provoking programme of music, academic lectures, poetry, debate and workshops. In &#8220;The River&#8221;, which I had the pleasure of seeing, a 150-strong community cast of dancers, singers and musicians of all ages, together with Barrowland Ballet&#8217;s small professional cast, told stories of migration and danced and sang along the banks of the Clyde as the audience followed them.</p><p>Those examples additionally demonstrated the rich new international connections that have been developed through the cultural programme: 109 programme projects have stated connections with Commonwealth countries, 27 of which have artists or participants visiting Scotland. The important thing about culture 2014 is that it was not just about broadcasting what Scotland has to the world; it was an invitation for the world to join in that celebration.</p><p>It has truly been a momentous few months of activity, but it is not quite finished yet. Culture 2014 is picking up the baton again and bringing it to Edinburgh to mix with the festivals here before climaxing in a final weekend of activity that includes &#8220;The King of Ghosts&#8221; at the Edinburgh mela; &#8220;East End Social&#8221; at Richmond park; Scotland&#8217;s first international inclusive dance festival, &#8220;Gathered Together&#8221;, at the Tramway; and Hanna Tuulikki&#8217;s &#8220;Away with the Birds&#8221; on Canna.</p><p>The cultural programme has been delivered by a partnership between the Glasgow 2014 organising committee, Glasgow Life and Creative Scotland, as well as hundreds of artists, cultural organisations and communities across Scotland and beyond. I want to emphasise my thanks to all the partners for organising this unique, exciting and diverse programme of cultural activity, which has placed artists at the centre.</p><p>In our reflection with representatives of the 23 Governments that were here over the past few days as part of the international culture summit, great interest was focused on the Commonwealth games cultural programme, with many countries looking to learn what we do. For example, the Japanese city of Tokyo, which is hosting the Olympics in 2020, is very interested in what we are doing, and Brazil, which has the next Olympic games, is also very interested in what is happening here.</p><p>Of course, what I have just described is only a snapshot, for this is perhaps the greatest year ever for festivals in Scotland, both in the number and in the sheer breadth of the festivals that are taking place. They range from the long-established and internationally renowned to small community events that have risen up, buoyed by this year&#8217;s feel-good factor. I want to thank all the volunteers who help make festivals happen the length and breadth of Scotland. Their enthusiasm, dedication and commitment is often the lifeblood of the festivals in our communities.</p><p>Our festivals are vibrant, often challenging and always exciting. They provide a chance for both audiences and artists to step out of the everyday and come together in new spaces and under new terms. They provide windows for transformation, both personally and for our communities. They bring neighbours together, they promote understanding of other cultures and other experiences from all over the world, and they improve our sense of who we are and why we matter.</p><p>I look forward to hearing members&#8217; reflections on the value of festivals to Scotland. I hope that through consensus on the motion this afternoon Parliament will recognise what a groundbreaking year this is for our festivals, acknowledge that success is often based on the motivation, passion and commitment of local communities, and recognise and, indeed, celebrate the great success of culture 2014 and festival 2014.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises that Scotland&#8217;s culture is in vigorous health and that this is reflected in the continued success of Scotland&#8217;s festivals, including the Edinburgh festivals, which are internationally renowned for their excitement, vision and artistic ambition; congratulates all of those involved in the successful Festival 2014 and the ongoing Culture 2014 on enabling people across Scotland to share in the cultural celebration of the Commonwealth Games; celebrates the vibrancy and diversity of Scotland&#8217;s music festivals; acknowledges the importance of all of Scotland&#8217;s festivals, both large and small, across all the country, and notes the enjoyment that they bring and their impact on tourism and local economies, and is especially appreciative of the hard work that communities contribute to ensure that smaller regional festivals are a success.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>I am interested to hear about Liz Smith&#8217;s connection to Scottish Opera. This year, Scottish Opera performed &#8220;Anamchara&#8221;, which brought together New Zealand and other countries from all over the Commonwealth. The link to that outward perspective is still strong.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>I think that Rhoda Grant is confusing some of the competitions. The world pipe band championship has been in Glasgow&#8212;which regained it&#8212;for the past few years. The Dunoon championship is a different competition. Perhaps I could write to her to explain that.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>Sandra White was right when she said that the debate has been a showcase of Scotland. We are a nation that is rich in festivals, and it is clear that there is a shared appreciation of and passion for all our festivals whether they are big or small, international or local and community focused.</p><p>I was particularly interested in the fact that there were 25,000 people in Kirkintilloch on one day for the canal festival, which was mentioned by Fiona McLeod. Rhoda Grant reflected on how disproportionate the impact of festivals is in smaller areas. There is a consensus around the importance of festivals&#8212;the enjoyment that they bring and the impact that they have on tourism and local economies. As Elaine Murray said, we should reiterate our appreciation for all the hard work that local communities put into the smaller, regional festivals to ensure that they are a success.</p><p>Nigel Don referred to James Taylor and the tea festival in Laurencekirk. I reassure him that the tea festival is already international. Only last week, the Sri Lankan high commissioner was the first to tell me about the tea festival that is taking place in Laurencekirk.</p><p>I am delighted that we have also had the opportunity to celebrate the great success of festival 2014 and its on-going partner, culture 2014. It is important that we recognise that it has been the most ambitious national cultural celebration ever to have taken place in Scotland.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson referred to a number of our festivals, including the book festival. Yesterday, I was pleased to be with the Irish culture minister at the book festival, where we introduced a discussion on the exchange between Neil Gunn and Maurice Walsh. Patricia Ferguson also mentioned the Imaginate festival, which we should perhaps celebrate more. At the recent culture summit, the Maltese delegation said that she is taking the idea of the Imaginate festival to Malta. She also made the suggestion that Glasgow host a festival of sport. I will make sure that my colleague Shona Robison hears about that.</p><p>It is important to recognise the embracing nature of festivals, which have often involved sports and culture. Liz Smith took us back to the origins of many festivals, some of which focused on nature and some of which focused on religion. Festivals can also recognise the importance of food and drink, as Stewart Stevenson highlighted. My suggestion for the west end festival is that, given that next year is the year of Scotland&#8217;s food and drink, that might be an appropriate focus in its search for additional funding.</p><p>Sarah Boyack took a realistic and pragmatic approach to the issue of capacity. The second &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; report will be important in ensuring that we are not complacent and that Edinburgh takes a competitive look at where it is. Liam McArthur recognised that some capacity issues might be related to transport, while Sarah Boyack talked about the need for investment in venues, which is an important point for all cities to understand. That is why the references by Colin Keir and Nanette Milne to the role of local authorities were significant. I try to support investment in culture wherever I can, including investment in venues in our cities, but that investment relies on local authorities also seeing festivals as powerhouses of their local economies. We have to work together to secure that support.</p><p>Willie Coffey reminded us of the joy of festivals and the sheer joy of enjoyment. That is an important point. He also pointed out that the Darvel music festival is only 14 years old. Many of our festivals are new and are developing. As Rhoda Grant alluded to, there is a tension around the idea of whether it is possible to nationally programme festivals.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson talked about challenges, and perhaps we need a bit of the helpful anarchy that comes from the fact that festivals can come and go at different times. We look forward to Rock Ness returning, but that is a decision for the private promoters.</p><p>On Saturday night, in my hometown of Linlithgow, I was at the party in the palace, which featured Hue and Cry and Deacon Blue. Although, in this crowded year, people might say that too much is on, that was a new celebration that took place. We should think about the growth in the range of festivals, and about the fact that some are extremely new.</p><p>We should also reflect on the fact that festivals should share their experience. For example, the taste of the tattoo events have been taken to Stirling, Glasgow and Dundee, and Festivals Edinburgh has advised the Scottish history festival, the Edinburgh international fashion festival and the Aberdeen festivals collective, sharing its knowledge and understanding.</p><p>I recognise the important work of EventScotland and its partners for the year of homecoming. It has invested more than &#163;3 million in more than 1,000 events in Scotland.</p><p>On what we get from our festivals, we must remember that they are also an expression of who we are. One of the performers at Glasgow green during festival 2014, a Malawian rapper called Tay Grin, commented that Scots really know how to embrace their culture and support one another. For me, that is one of the key messages to come from the Commonwealth games. In terms of the legacy and how we build on the success of that incredible programme, it is vital that we continue to embrace and celebrate our culture in all its forms.</p><p>I heard what Rob Gibson said about Struileag and &#8220;The Children of the Smoke&#8221;. We need to take some of the great performances that have been experienced and think about how we can share them more widely.</p><p>I want to end not on the majesty of the tattoo, the glamour of the international festival or the spectacle of culture 2014 but on some of the local festivals. There are two in my area that I want to mention in particular.</p><p>The Bathgate music festival has been running for only seven years. However, this year, it featured LaFontaines, who went down a storm at T in the Park last month and performed at Scotland week in New York earlier this year. There is also the Linlithgow folk festival in September, which has been running for 16 years. It has a small but highly talented and enthusiastic group of volunteers. As with many of the festivals that we have heard of, the contributors and the volunteers who take the tickets and steward the events must be celebrated.</p><p>As we once again find ourselves looking at the world stage, it is worth reflecting on the deeper meaning of festivals. As we find ourselves facing images of turmoil from around the world, we recall that the Edinburgh international festival was established in the wake of the second world war as a platform for the flowering of the human spirit, with the aim of bringing together the countries of the world through culture. In a powerful speech, Clare Adamson talked about the Durban choir. I am sure that we all heard how excellent the singers were, even if we were not in the room. She talked about the importance of the power of culture to connect cultures and peoples, to foster understanding and, yes, to be a bridge to peace in a way that other interventions perhaps cannot be.</p><p>We have had a fantastic celebration of the Commonwealth games. I am glad that culture has been able to play such an important role in that&#8212;it will build partnerships that will take us forward.</p><p>We must remember that all our festivals and the stages that they provide&#8212;be they the wooden floor of a school hall, a vast amphitheatre or, as Patricia Ferguson mentioned, strange venues such as the dissection room of the veterinary college, which is now Summerhall&#8212;are important in letting our nation&#8217;s voices, hopes and aspirations be heard by ourselves and by the rest of the world. We are a creative nation, contributing to the world, and are recognised for our global impact. Culture and our festivals are a huge part of that.</p><p>I believe in a Scotland that embraces its culture and heritage but which also generates a dynamic momentum and has a cutting edge that allows us to share our innovations with the world. Our festivals provide such a platform.</p><p>I will end with what I think was the best point of the debate. Fiona McLeod reminded us that festivals let us indulge our passions and stretch our horizons.</p><p>I thank all the members who have spoken, and ask them to agree to the motion in my name.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>Thank you, dearest Presiding Officer.</p><p>I join other members in congratulating Bill Kidd on securing the debate. It was good to hear from Bill Kidd about the dearest Scotland initiative and to get a sense from him and other members of their visions for Scotland.</p><p>For me, one of the best features of the current constitutional debate has been the fact that it has broadened the way in which we conduct politics. This Parliament has contributed signally to that process, not least through the festival of politics that will be held here at the end of the week. This year, the festival&#8212;which is now in its 10th year&#8212;will include many fascinating sessions on aspects of the referendum debate.</p><p>We have seen new or revived approaches to politics not just in the Parliament but outside it as well, right across Scotland. I think that those on the other side of the debate would agree that one of the great and unexpected bonuses of the current constitutional debate has been the way in which it has encouraged us to get out and debate key issues in public meetings.</p><p>I have been engaging with people in town hall meetings from Ayr to Stromness, and I have found it really energising to hear and engage with the public in different ways. Some of the methods of public engagement have been, like those local public meetings, revivals of past tried-and-tested approaches, while others have used much more modern approaches such as social media and texting.</p><p>As a fairly frequent tweeter myself, I certainly see the value in those approaches. Much can be said in a few words or 140 characters, if they are well chosen. There was something marvellously modern and yet traditional in the fact that Seamus Heaney&#8217;s last words were a texted message comprising two Latin words: &#8220;Noli timere&#8221;, or &#8220;be not afraid&#8221;. I hope that people will reflect on that message over the next few weeks.</p><p>Although I am a fan of texts and tweets, sometimes there is no substitute for a letter&#8212;or indeed, in the words of the motion, a &#8220;love letter&#8221;. Letters are an irreplaceable way of expressing our thoughts and emotions, and I commend the dearest Scotland initiative for encouraging us to do just that in relation to Scotland itself.</p><p>I also commend the project&#8217;s inclusive nature, welcoming letters from those of any opinion or indeed none on the constitutional question and accepting letters that are in prose or verse or which are fact or fiction. People do not need to be ministers, parliamentarians or any kind of politician to add their own vision and weave their own thread into the tartan. Although everyone in those categories is welcome to contribute, so is everyone else. The only requirement is that the letter start &#8220;Dearest Scotland&#8221;, and I am sure that we can all unite in holding Scotland very dear indeed.</p><p>Of course, that does not mean that we cannot also be critical, where that is merited. For example, a letter from Ruth in Winchburgh in my constituency combines deep love with an anxiety to see the best made universal. She has written:</p><p>&#8220;I love you so much. You are a beautiful, lush &amp; green country that has always been good to me. I just wish that everyone else could have the same opportunities. Simple things like a decent education, a job (a proper job) a home, and the opportunity to contribute collectively are what matter most. Please let&#8217;s all work together to make this happen. Let&#8217;s have an approach that ensures life is &#8216;fair&#8217; for us all.&#8221;</p><p>For that matter, the youngest contributor so far, five-year-old Rosa, has written:</p><p>&#8220;I think there should be more adventure playgrounds in Glasgow, and in schools. Children learn a lot from playing outdoors especially in the woods. I want there to be more small shops selling vegetables and fruit. There should be more farms near Glasgow. I think there should be outdoor swimming pools.&#8221;</p><p>I very much agree with the motion in congratulating Cat Cochrane and her colleagues, including Sarah Drummond and Lauren Currie, on this project. I gather that congratulations are also due to Cat Cochrane on winning the prize for the best arts and entertainment story at this year&#8217;s Scottish student journalism awards. It is a credit to Glasgow Clyde College.</p><p>I know that the organisers of the dearest Scotland campaign intend to send an archive of the collected letters to the Scottish Government at the end of the year, and we look forward to receiving that. The National Library of Scotland will also be archiving the material as part of its vital project to document the referendum campaign fully; indeed, it is holding a drop-in session about the project this Saturday from 11 o&#8217;clock to 2 o&#8217;clock. As a result, the letters will become part of this country&#8217;s established historical record.</p><p>I will close with a poem called &#8220;Dearest Scotland&#8221; by Tessa Ransford, which appears on dearest Scotland website and was inspired by the initiative. I think that it brings home the importance of having the chance to form our own vision, regardless of what that vision might be.</p><p>&#8220;Dearest Scotland</p><p>I used to walk down the Canongate, empty and dark,</p><p>after another day at the Poetry Library</p><p>whose very existence depended on my work</p><p>however exhausted I was, drained and hungry;</p><p>but I had a tryst to keep with Scottish poetry;</p><p>and I&#8217;d compare myself to my seafaring ancestor</p><p>who sailed to Australia in a Clyde paddle-steamer.</p><p>If he overcame the dangerous currents and oceans,</p><p>attacks by pirates and running out of fuel,</p><p>I could surely sail on with minimum funds</p><p>when I had a chart, a vision and a goal</p><p>with a volunteer crew of experts, friends and faithful</p><p>navigators; like ancient Celtic adventurers</p><p>we set afloat a curragh of poetry practitioners.</p><p>Such risk in action brings its accompaniment</p><p>and gathers its own momentum and impetus.</p><p>To wait and see or slump in bewilderment</p><p>will never achieve our destiny, our bliss.</p><p>To make our own decisions and choose our course</p><p>will see us voyage ahead on a life of adventure</p><p>and find our way to the next desirable harbour.&#8221;</p><p>I think that that captures what this is all about. There should be more poetry and culture in our political debate, and I congratulate the dearest Scotland campaign on allowing not only the chamber but the whole of Scotland to share in it.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Dearest Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>At the successful British-Irish Council summit that was held in Guernsey on 13 June, we discussed the economic situation with a consensus that there was cautious optimism but a need to look at the nature of recovery and the sustainability of growth. We discussed the importance of good transport links with a strong case for changes to air passenger duty, the reduction of which will allow Scotland&#8217;s airports to become more competitive in attracting new direct routes and will improve our international connectivity. We also considered various workstreams including spatial planning. Copies of the communiqu&#233; and the BIC annual report are available on the British-Irish Council&#8217;s website.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: British-Irish Council (Meetings)"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>At the British-Irish Council, there was extensive discussion of air passenger duty. It was indicated that Ryanair has said that it will deliver an additional 1 million passengers as a direct result of the Irish Government&#8217;s decision to abolish its air travel tax from April 2014. We also shared with the British-Irish Council information from the York Aviation study that was commissioned by Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, which found that, by 2016, &#163;210 million per annum less will have been spent in Scotland by inbound visitors than would have been spent if APD had not risen as it has since 2007. There is clearly a strong case for more powers for the Parliament to ensure that we make the difference for our economy.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: British-Irish Council (Meetings)"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>I welcome the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s report, which has highlighted a number of areas in which it is important to clarify our intentions. I agree with the committee on the need for a clear and shared understanding. I will refer in my speech to the key topics that it considered, and I will write to the committee before recess to respond item by item to its thorough and encouraging report.</p><p>We last debated Scotland&#8217;s historic environment in September. That debate reminded us that heritage takes many forms, from our stunning castles, abbeys and prehistoric sites to the living heritage of song, poetry and traditions. I recently visited Urquhart castle on Loch Ness to see one of Scotland&#8217;s premier monuments. We have witnessed the response to the fire at Glasgow School of Art, admired the resilience of those who have been directly affected and been stunned by the flood of offers of help from around the world.</p><p>It strikes me that the historic environment is as much about people as about buildings. The historic environment is about what people want to pass on to their children and grandchildren, and where we come from, where we are today and where we are all going. Scotland&#8217;s historic environment is a vital resource in cultural, social and economic terms. It can and should deliver greater benefits for communities; I believe that we all agree on that. As the committee recognises in its report, the Historic Environment Scotland Bill is only one part of a wider strategy, which I will say more about in a few moments.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s central purpose is to create a single modern body with clearly defined functions. It is designed to sustain the strong base that we already possess and to prepare for the future. In that ambition, the bill is not revolutionary, although I was gratified to hear a delegate at a recent conference referring to it as</p><p>&#8220;a triumph and long overdue&#8221;.</p><p>It surprised me, when I took on my present portfolio, to learn that, although the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland has a royal warrant that sets out its terms of reference, an organisation as distinctive as Historic Scotland currently has no statutory existence. Although it performs statutory functions, it does so as an administrative aspect of ministers. We do not believe that that is right, and we intend to create a non-departmental public body with its own board to provide strong and transparent governance. We firmly believe that the role of ministers is to steer activities at a strategic level and not interfere in the details of particular cases, where professional expertise should be the guide.</p><p>The bill sets out explicit functions for the new body, and the committee has considered those functions carefully. Beyond that, the bill sets out how those functions will be carried out. It will require historic environment Scotland to offer leadership, support and partnership working so that knowledge, skills and resources are mobilised to best effect throughout the sector. HES will be expected to help things to happen just as much as it will be expected to do things at its own hand.</p><p>The bill aligns designation and consents for monuments, listed buildings and conservation areas more closely with modern planning practice. It repositions historic environment Scotland largely as a consultation body alongside Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to create a simpler system for all who are involved in the vital business of developing Scotland&#8217;s full potential.</p><p>These changes have been welcomed by local authorities, which are working with us on the details. To balance the greater freedom that the new body will have, the bill creates new rights of appeal.</p><p>The committee has commented on the arrangements in the bill for delegating the operation and management of the 345 properties in state care through ownership or guardianship agreements to HES. We share the committee&#8217;s assessment of just how significant those iconic properties are. That is why ministers have decided to retain the ultimate responsibility for their conservation and for public access.</p><p>The committee has commented on the possibility of HES seeking charitable status. As I have stated on more than one occasion, that is something that I wish the new board to decide for itself. However, I can say now that I will work very closely with the incoming chair to emphasise how vital it is for HES to support other bodies that are already working in the sector. That will apply whether or not HES seeks or achieves charitable status.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>I think that the member was a member of the committee when it considered the National Library of Scotland Bill. The NLS has charitable functions and the national collections are charities, but they are non-departmental public bodies. What he describes therefore occurs in a number of similar areas.</p><p>I expect the new body that will be created by the Historic Environment Scotland Bill to lead the sector in delivering shared goals but to do so in a supportive manner and in partnership. I also intend to start work on recruiting the board of HES as soon as Parliament agrees to the general principles of the bill.</p><p>The shared goals&#8212;what we expect from the new body, working with its different partners in the sector&#8212;will be founded on &#8220;Our Place In Time&#8212;The Historic Environment Strategy for Scotland&#8221;. The strategy sets out a clear vision for the historic environment to ensure that it is even better understood, protected and celebrated. I welcome the committee&#8217;s strong interest in the collective work undertaken by the sector to develop a strategic vision and framework for the sector. This is the starting point of a long-term process, which will be very much a partnership.</p><p>I have been heartened by the engagement of the wider sector in the creation of the strategy and very much look forward to chairing the first meeting of its overarching forum this Monday. I recently wrote to the convener of the committee setting out the membership of the forum.</p><p>The strategy will interact with many other initiatives, such as the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill, which was introduced into Parliament on 11 June.</p><p>The Government firmly believes in communities and in collaborative action. We will take on board the committee&#8217;s message that the local dimension will be key both to the operations of HES and to its ability to support local communities in making local decisions that contribute to national outcomes. We are asking the whole historic environment community to work together in this enterprise.</p><p>What is the Scottish Government contributing? One of the issues raised at the committee was funding. Despite the economic situation, we have been able to maintain Historic Scotland&#8217;s budget for the grants that it makes on ministers&#8217; behalf to projects throughout Scotland that are related to historic buildings, conservation areas and archaeological investigations. We recognise that communities have vast enthusiasm and energy but that financial resources are harder to come by. That is why I have worked hard to protect Historic Scotland&#8217;s external grants programme for this year.</p><p>I can today confirm that I have asked Historic Scotland to maintain its annual grant budget at approximately &#163;14.5 million into 2015-16. I will look to its successor to continue to support others through grants and in as many ways as possible.</p><p>I am also pleased to announce grants totalling almost &#163;2 million, which include support for the ambitious plans of Glasgow&#8217;s Citizens Theatre, which the Heritage Lottery Fund is also backing. The grants will support restoration work at seven historic sites across Scotland and take the amount that Historic Scotland has awarded in building repair grants to almost &#163;28 million over the past five years. That underlines our commitment to protecting and preserving Scotland&#8217;s built heritage for future generations and to ensuring that the historic environment continues to play an important role in supporting local communities and the Scottish economy.</p><p>I commend the skills and passion of the staff of Historic Scotland and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. I am unfailingly impressed by the professionalism that they bring to the unending task of caring for our heritage and by the variety of approaches that they bring to bear. This Government will support staff with their work as we go into the future, as they in turn work alongside our local authorities, conservation charities and many thousands of private owners, all of whom make invaluable contributions to the historic environment.</p><p>In conclusion, I reiterate why we believe that the bill deserves the support of Parliament. It brings together two successful bodies to create a single, modern body that is better equipped to meet future challenges. It sets out in one place, for the first time, the key historic environment functions that this Government believes should be supported. It sets out principles of partnership working and transparency within a broader strategic framework. It simplifies essential processes so that we can concentrate on getting the best for and from our historic environment. It reaffirms the Government&#8217;s commitment to a historic environment that is at the heart of a flourishing and sustainable Scotland. For those reasons, I ask for members&#8217; support for the motion.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Historic Environment Scotland Bill.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>I very much appreciate the member&#8217;s points and will address them either in my summing-up speech or certainly in my response to the committee.

I will explore all the constructive suggestions that have been made this afternoon for improving the proposals and the recommendations from the lead committee and the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee. I plan to write to the Education and Culture Committee before the recess and, in my letter, I will include responses to the additional ideas that have been discussed this afternoon. However, I can say now that I expect to respond positively to the principles behind all the committee&#8217;s recommendations. I believe that the bill and the accompanying dialogue with stakeholders will be stronger as a result.</p><p>In my opening speech, I touched on the key themes of the committee&#8217;s report. The committee has accurately mapped the themes that matter, which include the relationship between the bill, the new body that it creates and the sector-wide strategy; the benefits that the bill will bring and how they will be monitored; the need for transparency; the importance of communities; and the role of ministers.</p><p>The strategy is collectively owned by all the participating independent bodies. As chair of the overarching strategic forum&#8212;I say for clarity that it is a forum rather than a board&#8212;my task will be to promote consensus. For it to work, the strategy will require voluntary agreement.</p><p>If we come to insuperable problems, we will need to work round them or approach them from a new angle. To state the obvious, consensus works only if it remains consensual.</p><p>Historic environment Scotland will be a public body and will be required to play a key role in delivering the Government&#8217;s contribution to the shared priorities that are agreed through the strategy. I can and will hold HES to account through its chair for how it delivers; that is how all non-departmental public bodies work and that is why we chose that model.</p><p>I will address the point that Liz Smith raised and which Patricia Ferguson reflected on in her closing speech about the balance in ministerial direction. As a minister, I cannot direct the strategic forum, but I can direct HES on strategic matters. I can direct HES on properties in care, as they are ministers&#8217; responsibility, but I cannot direct it on grant decisions, on listing and scheduling decisions or&#8212;this is important to a point that Patricia Ferguson made&#8212;on collecting decisions and curatorial matters.</p><p>Liam McArthur talked about functions and raised the Law Society&#8217;s point that the bill does not use the word &#8220;maintaining&#8221;. However, we talk about protecting, managing, conserving, enhancing and preserving the historic environment. The words &#8220;conserving&#8221; and &#8220;preserving&#8221; have a specific meaning in relation to heritage, so we are well covered.</p><p>The Government has a duty to involve and support local communities and communities of interest in defining priorities and taking action. That applies to the historic environment as it does more widely. That is why the bill requires our new lead body to work in partnership. However, I accept the committee&#8217;s view, which has been reinforced in members&#8217; speeches today, that the bill does not give sufficient prominence to the role of local communities, and we will address that issue as we move forward.</p><p>Neil Bibby mentioned the marine environment, and I refer him to schedule 4. HES will act as an adviser to the Government and will continue its recording activities, and the Government, through Marine Scotland, will undertake designation and consent. That arrangement will maintain the unified marine regulation system that was recently introduced by the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson touched on the very important role of local authorities, which play a fundamental part in looking after the historic environment in the form of designated and undesignated heritage. The bill does not change that fundamental role, but it will enable HES to support local authorities more effectively.</p><p>Liam McArthur raised the issue of charitable status. The committee received written evidence from the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, which confirmed that a charity with regulatory functions would be &#8220;unusual ... but not unique.&#8221; Other such bodies include the General Teaching Council for Scotland and the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p><p>I have spoken about the support that is required on certain aspects such as grants advice, training and skills, and HES will continue to carry out that function. I will consider further Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s point about including a reference to skills in the bill.</p><p>There will be situations in which a strong lead is needed, whether that is in research or in project management. I particularly welcome the strong working relationship that exists with the National Trust for Scotland, which demonstrates the type of collaboration that we can achieve. For an example of that we need look no further than the new Bannockburn centre, which was delivered on time and within budget in co-operation with the NTS.</p><p>Shared projects that make the best use of talents regardless of how they are badged will be the best way forward in many regards. One important shared project has existed for a century, and will be redefined in the bill. Historic Scotland cares for and presents to the public the many properties in state care. In future, ownership and guardianship will remain with ministers but management and operation will be delegated to HES. We have chosen that arrangement not because of a lack of trust in the staff who already care for those properties so well. Rather, we recognise the direct commitment that our predecessors gave to those who passed the properties into state care. That special relationship will be reflected in the careful design of the scheme of delegation, which will be published before it comes into effect. Performance against that scheme will be monitored, and the results will be published. Of course, conservation is a never-ending task.</p><p>We have also provided in the bill for ministers to be able to delegate the management of historic properties to bodies other than HES. Although we have no immediate plans to do so, we believe that there may be situations in the future in which that might be appropriate.</p><p>With regard to the point that the Society of Antiquaries raised, we are happy to accept the DPLR committee&#8217;s recommendation for close scrutiny of any proposal that a body would require to take, and we plan to lodge an amendment at stage 2 that will require that any such body will be specified by order with affirmative parliamentary procedure so that the Parliament has an opportunity to respond.</p><p>I will respond to the Education and Culture Committee on the points that have been raised in the debate and in its report. We will have a better body to lead us into the future with regard to the management of the historic environment and leadership in this area.</p><p>I will close with a few points. Mike MacKenzie and George Adam gave passionate and well-informed contributions, and Stewart Maxwell rightly gave us all the challenge of asking ourselves how we, as MSPs, should help to lead the historic environment. I commend in particular Graeme Dey, who has personally taken responsibility for trying to galvanise the heritage and local community in Arbroath around the abbey there.</p><p>Finally, I agree with the Labour Party, which we do not always do. Patricia Ferguson, who has made two fine and informed speeches this afternoon, instructed members that we should travel to Orkney as soon as possible. I am delighted to report to her that I will be on a flight to Orkney tomorrow morning to attend the St Magnus festival.</p><p>I follow in the footsteps of the Education and Culture committee members, who had such a wonderful visit to Orkney, where we can celebrate our heritage and see where partnership with the local community really works. Orkney demonstrates our wonderful heritage, not only the built environment but the intangible heritage that is expressed in the performances that I have seen there. I know that Patricia Ferguson would want to know if we have an extra seat so she can go with me, and I will see what I can do.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>I visited Ireland in May to further strengthen our common cultural and heritage links with Ireland.</p><p>At the Newgrange neolithic tomb, I announced the discovery of a skeleton in East Lothian that Dr Alex Woolf of the University of St Andrews has advised may be Olaf Guthfrithsson, a 10th century king of Dublin and Northumbria.

Indeed, the south-east of England accounts for more than half of the annual economic output of the UK, and eight out of 10 jobs that are created in the UK are in London.</p><p>Historically, Scotland has lost thousands of young people to the south every year, and that risk remains even though our jobs market is better in comparison with the jobs market in most other areas of the UK. Currently, that unstable situation is out of our hands, and it inevitably creates a drag on attempts to improve our economy.</p><p>We know that Scotland&#8217;s public finances are stronger than those of the UK. Since 1980, on average, we have run a public sector surplus. If we had been in charge of our own economy in that time, there is every chance that, according to the &#8220;Scotland Means Business&#8221; report that was prepared earlier this year by Biggar Economics, our public finances</p><p>&#8220;would still be benefitting from a significant cumulative surplus&#8221;.</p><p>Another factor that we must take into account is the frankly appalling level of inequality in the UK. The UK is ranked 26th out of 29 advanced countries for inequality. That is clearly quite an alarming figure, but one that is perhaps unsurprising given the increasing poverty that exists thanks to Westminster&#8217;s economic initiatives. I will give an example. The low-paid lose out year after year as a result of Westminster&#8217;s refusal to peg rises in the minimum wage to inflation.</p><p>To give a comparison, in 2010-11 Scotland ranked 16th out of 29 for inequality. Given our high levels of GDP, our strong public finances and the fact that, for example, Scotland&#8217;s output per head is 10 per cent above the UK average, not to mention our oil and renewable energy resources, Scotland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The economic opportunities that would be afforded to us by independence would provide the choices to make inroads in reducing inequality and to build a fairer society. We would be able to peg minimum wages to ensure that the lowest paid are not cast further adrift, and we would, of course, take charge of our own welfare system, which would mean that we would never have negative and unproductive measures such as the bedroom tax imposed on those who can least afford it.</p><p>Let us not forget that Westminster still wants to make many more spending cuts and that independence is the only guarantee that we can choose not to impose those cuts. If Scotland was in charge of its own economy, we would design an economic policy tailored to Scotland and to our society&#8217;s needs that would benefit all sectors and ages in this country. We can transform our childcare system by providing the same number of hours of pre-primary education childcare as children receive in primary school at present.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>The economic knock-on effect will be that more parents, and women in particular, will have greater choices and career prospects, thus increasing both jobs and tax revenue.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>If the number of women in work increased by just 6 per cent, tax revenues would rise by about &#163;700 million.</p><p>For those who are studying, we will certainly continue our policy of free education for Scottish students who study in this country, thus minimising the amount of debt that Scottish students have when they embark upon their careers. For those who come here to study, we will have the opportunity in an independent Scotland to examine the reintroduction of the post-study work visa, which Westminster abolished without considering Scotland&#8217;s economic needs.</p><p>Independence would put the Scottish welfare system back in Scottish hands. Cutting the bedroom tax would put roughly &#163;50 a month back into the hands of more than 80,000 households. Every penny counts at a time when increasingly many of our poorest people are relying on food banks, and Westminster&#8217;s planned roll-out of universal credit is only going to make matters worse. By ensuring that the most vulnerable of our society have the financial support that they need, our economy will be stable from the ground up.</p><p>The ability to provide a fair and stable pension is another opportunity that independence provides. The UK has one of the worst records of state pension provision in Europe. As with the welfare system, Westminster ignores Scotland&#8217;s differing needs in terms of life expectancy. Indeed, it is more than likely that the state pension age will be raised to 70 if we remain part of the United Kingdom. The Scottish Government intends to increase the state pension by at least 2.5 per cent for the first independent Scottish Parliament. That is a start; Scottish pensioners will no longer be left alone to struggle to make ends meet.</p><p>We would also finally have the ability to set up an energy fund for future generations, a step that successive UK Governments have never taken due to the lack of long-term vision at Westminster. Scotland has over 60 per cent of oil reserves of all of the EU, not to mention the second biggest gas reserves, and companies in the energy industry are planning to invest more than &#163;100 billion in the years to come. Having our economy in our own hands would protect the oil and gas industries from unexpected tax hikes by Westminster. An independent Scotland would provide stability and the environment to encourage long-term investment in oil and gas. Over the past few years energy bills have constantly risen for consumers and businesses alike. Independence can help us get the choices to stop and reverse that trend.</p><p>Taking control of our own tax system would allow us to encourage business and investment. Unlike the very limited tax powers being suggested by Opposition parties, an independent Scotland&#8217;s tax regime would mean that Scotland could choose to cut business rates, making it an attractive country for companies to retain their headquarters in and improving the opportunities for career progression&#8212;that logic speaks for itself.</p><p>In Midlothian North in my constituency&#8212;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>Clearly, independence will bring us the opportunities that we need to ensure that our economy is stable and competitive while providing a solid foundation so that the most vulnerable are not left behind.

Although the decoupling of those elections was necessary in the wake of the many serious failings that haunted the 2007 elections, only 39.1 per cent of the electorate turned out to vote in the 2012 council elections&#8212;a drop of 13.7 per cent on the turnout in 2007. Indeed, in the previous three elections, voter turnout was slightly lower for the council elections than it was for the Holyrood elections. I am not entirely sure why there is such a difference between parliamentary elections and local authority elections. Perhaps it shows a mistaken lack of belief in the relevance of local government.</p><p>We must work towards a solution to ensure legitimate authority. There is a famous saying that goes, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t vote, you can&#8217;t complain about what you get,&#8221; although people will complain anyway. The problem is that a lack of turnout results in a certain lack of legitimacy for any council or Government.</p><p>One very important part of the consultation is the proposal to extend the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds. I firmly believe that if someone is old enough to work, to pay tax, to get married and to join the army, surely they are old enough to make a reasoned decision on their country&#8217;s future. At that age, young people will have a vested interest in the outcome and what it will mean for their education or their employment prospects. I understand the argument that there are some immature teenagers who would not take that responsibility seriously, but I think that they would, most likely, form part of the electorate that do not turn out.</p><p>I still think that that is a real shame, and I believe that the solution is to have more interaction with students in and out of school. By being more proactive, we can reach them with more information. I hope that that would increase the level of interest in local and national politics, which might provide a sustainable boost to turnout at elections. Perhaps we can enthuse and inspire future generations to participate in politics. However, a key barrier to that idea is the fact that schools have&#8212;quite correctly&#8212;strict guidelines on access and impartiality. How we manage that reasonably is a challenge.</p><p>The consultation also looks at alternative voting methods for local council elections and provides four very interesting proposals, including universal postal voting, telephone voting, online voting and electronic machine voting, all of which have their good and bad points. The suggestion on universal postal voting is particularly interesting, because it removes the argument that people did not vote because they did not know that there was an election, and it enables people to vote from the comfort of their own homes.</p><p>However, there are two significant problems with universal postal voting. First, there is an issue with security and how confident people could be that each vote was cast by the registered voter for whom it was intended. Secondly, would voters mistakenly bin the forms or put off the task and just forget about it? That said, I acknowledge that postal voters are more likely to vote. That was shown at the 2010 general election, when 83 per cent of postal votes were returned, whereas only 63 per cent of those who could vote only at the polling station did so. It could be argued that those who registered for a postal vote were more likely to vote because they had gone to the trouble of arranging it.</p><p>Electronic machine voting does not do much for turnout, but it provides faster results. Arguably, it could reduce the number of spoiled ballots, but given the failed use of electronic counting machines in 2007, I would be cautious about the use of machines, which could suffer from unforeseen system errors and might lead to an election being invalidated.</p><p>I believe that the future may lie in online and telephone voting, although there are concerns about the security of those methods, especially online voting.

In Scotland, council tax and non-domestic rates, which are the only fully devolved taxes, account for 6.9 per cent of tax revenues. Given the limited powers that we have, the Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill represents an attempt to redress that state of affairs. The bill&#8217;s provisions on collection and management of the land and buildings transaction tax and the Scottish landfill tax will, I hope, raise the tax take to 7.5 per cent of revenues, which would be a small step in the right direction.</p><p>Taxation is fundamental to modern states and to provision of public goods and services. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average for tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product is about 34 per cent, which means that the UK&#8217;s 35 per cent is slightly above the average. We know that almost 70 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s revenue comes from income tax, VAT, national insurance contributions and North Sea revenue but, of course, that income is filtered through Westminster, and the Scottish Government has minimal flexibility in that regard. Only independence would enable us to take charge of our own tax affairs.</p><p>The land and buildings transaction tax is expected to improve significantly on the stamp duty system that it replaces. Each rate of LBTT will apply only to the part of the sale that is above the corresponding threshold. I hope that all members agree that that is much fairer than the stamp duty system, which applies to the entire sale price. The stamp duty system inevitably results in major discrepancies in relation to transactions on either side of the price threshold: an increase of just &#163;1 on a house price can result in a tax bill that is thousands of pounds higher.</p><p>Furthermore, stamp duty has been criticised because it can lead to the bunching of house prices, given that buyers are understandably keen to avoid paying it. The end result is a skewed pricing structure. In 2007, more than 3,500 houses in the &#163;125,000 band were sold, compared with just over 1,500 houses in the &#163;135,000 band. It is clear that changes need to be made. I look forward to next year&#8217;s introduction of the land and buildings transaction tax, which is a progressive tax that will be fair for all.</p><p>The creation of a general anti-avoidance rule is an important step in our efforts to combat tax avoidance. Recent stories in the media demonstrate that the issue is not going away. It is the Scottish Government&#8217;s responsibility to ensure that all devolved tax is paid on time, fairly and in full, especially given that we cannot rely on the Westminster machinery to close loopholes on our behalf. The importance of tackling tax avoidance cannot be overstated. To put it simply, tax avoidance reduces our public revenues and can fundamentally undermine public confidence in our tax system.</p><p>The bill will see the introduction of a 10 percentage point Scottish rate of income tax, which will reduce the budget by 10 per cent, but will allow the Scottish Government to decide whether to replace the lost revenue via that income tax. Although that measure will allow some flexibility, it has been criticised by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which said:</p><p>&#8220;while the Scottish parliament will be able to decide that income tax ought to be higher or lower overall, it will not be able to change the balance of liabilities between taxpayers at different income levels or with different types of income ... The SRIT will also prevent Scotland from reducing just the higher or additional rate of income tax as a form of tax competition to attract high-income people (and the revenue that accompanies them) from the rest of the UK. The SRIT is far from giving Scotland full autonomy over income tax policy.&#8221;</p><p>That raises a critical issue with the bill, which is that the Scottish Government is working within the confines of the Scotland Act 2012.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-05-20", "body": "<p>As the bill is about devolution of tax powers, it is reasonable to make the point that I made.</p><p>I said that the amount of fully devolved tax that we can raise will increase by only 0.6 of a percentage point, which is a drop in the ocean in comparison with what we could do in an independent Scotland. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies notes, the bill is rigid and inflexible and will not allow the Scottish Government to create a balanced tax regime. We cannot fully benefit if we lack control over revenue and expenditure.</p><p>We can take positives from the bill. The land and buildings transaction tax will implement a much fairer system for home buyers. The establishment of revenue Scotland as its own department with legal status will provide the basis of a tax collection agency in an independent Scotland. We should therefore regard the bill as a beginning and we should look forward to what can be achieved under independence.</p><p>At the moment, we rely on the UK tax system, which features more than 10,000 pages of legislation.

It will allow the confiscation of badges that are no longer valid or which are being misused by third parties; make the use of a cancelled badge or one that should have been returned to the issuing authority under the blue badge regulations an offence that sits alongside the existing statutory offence of misuse of a blue badge; allow local authorities, should they choose to do so, to use plain-clothes officers who are carrying identification and authorisation to inspect and confiscate badges; and introduce an important requirement for local authorities to have in place a review process for applicants who have been refused a blue badge.</p><p>On the surface, elements of the bill might appear punitive. However, its aim is to protect the rights of disabled blue badge holders and it responds to calls from badge holders for better enforcement of the scheme. Concerns have been expressed&#8212;primarily by Inclusion Scotland&#8212;about the confiscation of badges from third parties and the use of plain-clothes officers, but Dennis Robertson has been thorough in his consideration of and consultation on the issue. He has sought to protect badge holders by ensuring that all valid badges that have been confiscated will be returned to the badge holder as soon as is practicable.</p><p>In turn, local authorities want to ensure that badge holders can use their badges, whether as a driver or a passenger, for the intended purpose and within the scheme&#8217;s rules. The scheme provides street parking concessions to assist badge holders to live independent lives.</p><p>In response to the concern that Inclusion Scotland raised that plain-clothes officers will cause fear and alarm to badge holders or that such officers might be impersonated for fraudulent purposes, I agree with the conclusions that the Local Government and Regeneration Committee reached in its stage 1 report. Non-uniformed council officers already operate in a range of areas across Scotland without the difficulties that Inclusion Scotland suggested. The intention behind the bill is that non-uniformed officers will improve enforcement of the blue badge scheme by carrying out surveillance and gathering information and evidence on the systematic abuse of blue badges.</p><p>It is worth bearing in mind that someone misusing a blue badge or someone using a blue badge that is not rightfully theirs can save many thousands of pounds a year in certain parts of the country. Abuse of the scheme often involves the use of a person&#8217;s badge by a friend, family member or carer for their own benefit but it can extend beyond that. I understand that there is also a relatively lucrative trade in forged badges. The lure of free parking is a temptation that some people cannot refuse.</p><p>The bill also extends powers to the police and to traffic wardens to confiscate badges. I am happy to say that we are working with local authorities and Police Scotland to provide the police with access to the blue badge national database, which means that they will be able to check the status of blue badges anywhere in the country.</p><p>The bill is designed to fit in with existing powers and practices. Dennis Robertson has not been working in isolation. As we heard, he has been working closely with two working groups that have representation from local authorities, Police Scotland and third sector organisations to ensure that the bill translates and can easily work alongside current processes.</p><p>The provisions will be supported by guidance that will be developed by those multi-agency groups to address the requirements of the legislation. The guidance will also take into account the need for sensitivity and proportionality, which concerns were expressed about at stage 2.</p><p>Dennis Robertson&#8217;s work has been the catalyst in identifying a need to raise awareness of the blue badge scheme&#8217;s rules and regulations among badge holders, their families, carers and the wider public. I am pleased that that work is being progressed through those working groups.</p><p>The intention is to identify ways to clarify the purpose of the blue badge scheme and the impact of misuse on disabled people. I am sure that local authorities and the third sector will assist in getting across the messages about the scheme to the wider public.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Transport Scotland has commissioned work to test the understanding of blue badge holders of the proposed top 10 tips for using a blue badge. The tips are intended to act as an aide-memoire for badge holders, their relatives and carers on the dos and don&#8217;ts when using a blue badge. That concept was supported&#8212;perhaps even initiated to some extent&#8212;by the Local Government and Regeneration Committee.</p><p>Although the bill is primarily about increasing enforcement powers in practice, it will also send out a strong message to those who might think about using someone else&#8217;s badge for their own gain. I hope that it will make them think again about doing that. Misuse of a badge should be not only illegal but socially unacceptable.</p><p>Each time a blue badge is used for anything other than the purpose for which it was issued, not just one badge holder but many are prevented from getting on with their lives because they are prohibited from accessing the parking concessions to which they are entitled.</p><p>I thank Dennis Robertson for his work so far.

It complements a number of reforms that have been made to the scheme over recent years with the aim of providing a parking concession that enables disabled people who could not otherwise do so to have access to the day-to-day things that most people take for granted, such as healthcare, work and social activities.</p><p>The Scottish Government is continuing with that intention through the way in which it has been tackling the impact of the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reform programme. I will give some detail about that because, although the issue has not been raised to a huge extent so far, it provides the context for the proposed changes, and the time that we have available provides us with a chance to examine it further.</p><p>It is clear that the UK Government&#8217;s changes to the welfare system&#8212;including, crucially, the change from disability living allowance to the personal independence payment&#8212;are causing significant anxiety and distress to people in Scotland. I have had members from all round the chamber write to me about individual cases to do with blue badges over recent months.</p><p>It is completely unacceptable that some of the most vulnerable in our society are not getting the support that they need. However, our work has gone far beyond the steps that have been taken to protect blue badge holders in England and Wales. Of course, we believe that the best solution is for the Scottish Parliament to have control over welfare matters.</p><p>Last year, in establishing arrangements to allow those who receive the personal independence payment to passport automatically to the scheme, we recognised the potential impact of the decision to tighten the threshold that must be passed in order to receive the highest rate of PIP. That is why the passporting arrangements for PIP extend to those who receive the standard rate at 8 points or more for the &#8220;moving around&#8221; activity. That measure, which was taken by the Scottish Government, ensured that the passporting arrangements for PIP and disability living allowance were as equivalent as possible.</p><p>Obviously, we continue to monitor other proposed changes. We have also taken further action to mitigate the potential effects of PIP by including two further eligibility criteria to cover those people who passported under DLA but who do not receive PIP at a rate that enables them to passport following reassessment for the new welfare benefit.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>I am more than happy to consider that further. We have done a great deal of work, because we know how important the issue is. To put the matter in plain terms, some people who were eligible for the blue badge scheme and could passport into it automatically have been affected by the decisions and are asking why they have to be reassessed, for example. If there is anything further that we can do to ensure that the message is spread, we will certainly do it.</p><p>The first of the new criteria that we have included applies to those who do not receive PIP at the passporting rate and who are challenging that decision with the Department for Work and Pensions. The second new criterion ensures that those who were in receipt of a lifetime or indefinite higher-rate DLA award will continue to retain passporting entitlement to a blue badge, irrespective of the outcome of the PIP application.</p><p>In addition, we have also mitigated the well-reported delays to the PIP assessment process by ensuring that those who have applied for PIP but have not received their PIP decision by the time that their higher-rate DLA ends will continue to passport to the blue badge scheme.</p><p>In the white paper, we have made it clear that, if we are elected as the first Government of an independent Scotland, we will halt the further roll-out of personal independence payments. That will allow the first Government of an independent Scotland to design a welfare system that meets Scotland&#8217;s needs&#8212;especially the needs of the people who need to access the blue badge scheme.</p><p>We want the right people to have a badge. We also want a scheme that is fit for purpose. To go back to Dennis Robertson&#8217;s speech, without the strengthened enforcement powers that the bill provides, disabled badge holders might not reap the benefits to which they are entitled. That is the real point at issue. We need to ensure that those who need a blue badge are the ones who get it.</p><p>Christine Grahame raised an issue about supermarkets. As Mark Griffin rightly says, the Government has no control over that, as those car parks are private spaces. However, I wrote to the supermarkets some months ago to ask them to look into the matter to see what more they could do to protect the rights of people with disabilities. I think that we have all had the experience of going to a supermarket whose disabled bays are completely full and seeing someone with a disability having to struggle further than they should have to, given that it was perfectly clear that some people who were using those bays did not require them. If, as I suspect that it will be, the bill is passed, I undertake to write again to the supermarkets to draw their attention to what we have done and to see whether there is any way in which we can strengthen the situation in that regard.</p><p>Once again, I thank Dennis Robertson for the work that he has done and the way in which he has brought people together and dealt with the concerns that have been evident throughout the process.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>As long as it is not an application to be a non-uniformed officer.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>I would not want to steal Dennis Robertson&#8217;s thunder&#8212;he might want to respond to those points&#8212;but some of those challenges have been dealt with in the most recent reforms to the blue badge scheme, whereby the security of both the database and the badge itself has been upgraded. I have said that we are in discussions with Police Scotland to allow the police to access the database. That should be the means by which we make sure that we get the system right, so that those who are challenging people are aware that a particular badge plainly does not belong to the person using it. The unique identifier that Dennis Robertson mentioned will help in that regard. Perhaps he will want to say more about that in his closing speech.</p><p>I am convinced that the changes that we have made recently and the ones that Dennis Robertson has proposed have bolstered a very secure system. The bottom line is that it should ensure that disabled people&#8217;s parking spaces&#8212;of course, the blue badge also gives people a wider discretion to park elsewhere&#8212;are used only by those who are parking there legitimately and who want and need to do so, and that we try to eradicate the practice of people using them who are not entitled to do so.

Finally, we must consider the impact of those costs&#8212;estimated at more than &#163;100&#160;billion at 2012 prices&#8212;on our expenditure on conventional defence equipment and on future budgets in general. Each of those issues is crucial to Scotland&#8217;s future, so it is extremely important that the Parliament consider them.</p><p>Six weeks tomorrow, the people of Scotland will have the opportunity to decide whether Scotland will once again take its place as an independent country.

I cannot believe that there are not members of parties in the Scottish Parliament other than the Scottish National Party and the Green Party who would not be excited by that project, given that among the Parliament&#8217;s members are lifelong campaigners against nuclear weapons. Whatever their view on constitutional change, who would not be excited by the prospect of getting rid of nuclear weapons, especially when the alternative is a lifetime spent under the shadow of a new generation of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, and the yoke of their massive cost?</p><p>The vast majority of countries in the world neither have nor want nuclear weapons. Of the 193 United Nations independent member states, it is believed that fewer than 10 possess nuclear warheads, or aspire to do so. Three of the five states that currently host United States nuclear weapons have stated their wish to see the weapons&#8217; removal.</p><p>The Scottish Government is a firm supporter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Although some people might question the non-proliferation treaty&#8217;s success in relation to its ultimate aim of securing the reduction of nuclear arms, the NPT provides a clear basis for international management and control of nuclear material, technologies and information. We must build on that framework, to take the next step.</p><p>The Scottish Government believes that, rather than renewing and further developing their nuclear weapons systems, nuclear-weapons states need to focus their efforts on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. That is why, when we debated the issue in March last year, the Scottish Government lodged a motion that endorsed the five-point plan for nuclear disarmament that was set out by the secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-Moon. The plan builds on the NPT and calls on nuclear and non-nuclear-weapons states to fulfil their obligations under the treaty to pursue negotiations that lead to disarmament. I am glad to say that a majority in the Parliament supported that motion.</p><p>Having set out the context, I turn to the United Kingdom Government&#8217;s plans for the renewal of Trident nuclear weapons. The Prime Minister has said that in 2016 the UK Government will decide whether to replace the Trident submarine fleet. The decision, which prepares for Trident missiles with nuclear warheads being based on the Clyde through to 2060 and beyond, could have massive implications for the UK&#8217;s conventional defence forces, but if we look at the position of the three main parties at Westminster, we see that the so-called Trident &#8220;main gate&#8221; decision appears to have been made. Both coalition parties and Labour have signalled their support for a new fleet of submarines carrying Trident ballistic missiles, and questions remain around only the size of the fleet and whether nuclear weapons should be on patrol continuously.</p><p>It is particularly important for Labour back benchers who feel strongly about nuclear disarmament to understand that the alternative is the basing of massively powerful nuclear weapons and their delivery systems in central Scotland for the next 50 years or more. That is the alternative to what we propose. The current UK Government is sticking to its line that it has no plans to move those weapons from Her Majesty&#8217;s Naval Base Clyde. However, we believe that information that is critical to that decision&#8212;information on the costs and the consequences for the future of the UK&#8217;s armed forces&#8212;has not been made available either to members of Parliament at Westminster or to the general public.</p><p>On 1 July, the Trident commission, a cross-party inquiry led by representatives of the three main Westminster parties, published its concluding report. I disagree strongly with its support for the UK retaining nuclear weapons, and I was greatly concerned by its comments on the cost of Trident renewal and the impact that those costs could have on conventional defence personnel and equipment. The UK Government has provided estimates of the capital costs of replacing the submarine fleet that carries its nuclear weapons, of extending the life of the Trident missiles and of other infrastructure and warhead developments. According to the Trident commission&#8217;s report, those costs alone come to &#163;50.6&#160;billion at 2012 prices.</p><p>The Trident commission also estimates an annual in-service outlay on Trident running costs of around &#163;1.5&#160;billion at 2012 prices. Over an assumed operational lifetime of 35 years, that suggests a further &#163;52.5&#160;billion in running costs, taking the total potential cost of the UK Government&#8217;s Trident successor programme to over &#163;100&#160;billion at 2012 prices.</p><p>The Trident Commission&#8217;s overall financial assessment, which discounts future costs, suggests that the annual net present value of the Trident replacement system would average &#163;2.9&#160;billion per year. That is the equivalent of spending 9 per cent of the UK&#8217;s current defence budget on nuclear weapons each year. It also equates to between 20 and 30 per cent of the entire capital budget of all three services. However, as construction of the successor submarine fleet reaches its peak, the actual annual cash costs are projected to be even higher than that, at almost &#163;4&#160;billion a year by the mid-2020s, at 2012 prices. As the Trident commission recognises, that will</p><p>&#8220;place a heavy strain on MoD&#8217;s capital budget: in the period 2018 to 2030, between 20 and 30% of the whole defence capital budget shared between the three services will be spent on Trident renewal.&#8221;</p><p>Given the appalling cost overruns that tend to be typical of the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s projects&#8212;for example, the cost of the UK aircraft carrier programme rose from &#163;3&#160;billion to &#163;6&#160;billion in the blink of an eye&#8212;nobody really expects that the figures that I have just mentioned for the renewal of Trident will remain static.</p><p>The Trident commission&#8217;s concern echoes the comments of Professor Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute, who said in January 2013 that</p><p>&#8220;sharp increases in spending on Trident renewal in the early 2020s seem set to mean further years of austerity for conventional equipment plans.&#8221;</p><p>That will mean, among other things, not enough helicopter support, not enough personal equipment for the troops and perhaps not enough troops. Those things are part of the price of Trident.</p><p>The Trident commission&#8217;s report goes further and states:</p><p>&#8220;Important defence projects currently in the pipeline will surely suffer delay or cancellation.&#8221;</p><p>Even more worryingly, it states:</p><p>&#8220;Retaining the deterrent could negatively impact on other valuable security and defence capabilities.&#8221;</p><p>It is clear that renewing Trident nuclear weapons will impact on the future procurement of defence equipment such as the T26 global combat ships that will be needed by UK forces at home and overseas. In that respect, the Scottish Government supports the Trident commission&#8217;s conclusion that the UK Government needs to be</p><p>&#8220;transparent about the cost to the public purse.&#8221;</p><p>A decision that commits to the spending of over &#163;100&#160;billion of taxpayers&#8217; money and that has major consequences for future defence contracts at the expense of conventional defence capabilities is being taken without transparency about the costs and the impacts on other areas of defence spending.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>Jackie Baillie has already had the answer to that question. It is in the independence white paper, which says that we will spend &#163;2.5&#160;billion a year in Scotland on defence. Compare that with what we currently pay, which is &#163;3.3&#160;billion, even though only &#163;1.7&#160;billion, which is the amount from the last year for which records are available, was spent in Scotland. Therefore, we can both save on the budget and spend more on defence, which seems to be a pretty good solution for the people of Scotland.</p><p>On 8 July, the Deputy First Minister wrote to the Prime Minister calling for the true costs of Trident renewal to be made clear to the public. That includes transparency on the future UK defence projects that could be delayed, scaled back or cancelled in order to fund the replacement programme. To date, we have received no reply.</p><p>This Parliament should support the Government&#8217;s motion that such critical information be made available to defence personnel, to industry and businesses, to MPs and MSPs and, most important, to the public.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>One can provide information for people who do not want to see or acknowledge that information.

In fact, that update came to light only because President Obama reported to Congress on the matter. Surely members other than those on the Government benches must be concerned about the lack of transparency.</p><p>The Scottish Government expects to be preparing for independence in 2016. A vote for independence is the only option that comes with a commitment to securing the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Scotland. It is this Government&#8217;s aim to withdraw Trident from Scotland in the first term of the Scottish Parliament following independence. We believe that that is achievable and we look forward to sitting down with the UK Government to discuss the detailed timetable and to agree the arrangements. I assure the Parliament and the public that we would approach those discussions responsibly and that we would work closely with the UK Government to manage the withdrawal of Trident safely and securely.</p><p>On HMNB Clyde, the Scottish Government will maintain Faslane as an independent Scotland&#8217;s main naval base and as the home to our joint forces headquarters. The military personnel numbers based there will continue at around current levels, and Faslane&#8217;s conventional naval and forces HQ roles will support significant numbers of civilian personnel.

We intend to have 15,000 such personnel. That is an expansion of the armed forces rather than the issuing of P45s to people on the front line, as is the case now.</p><p>Some people will say that maintaining Trident at any cost is a price worth paying to protect our national security. I disagree. I support the view of former UN weapons inspector, Hans Blix, who has commented that he does not consider Britain to be more protected by Trident. He also noted&#8212;quite correctly&#8212;that other countries, including Germany and Japan, are managing well without nuclear weapons.</p><p>This Parliament should signal its opposition to the renewal of Trident nuclear weapons and commit to working with nuclear and non-nuclear states in the pursuit of nuclear disarmament.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s population share of the equivalent annual costs for the Trident replacement programme equates to about &#163;240&#160;million a year. To put that into perspective, that is more than we spend on the concessionary bus travel scheme and on our support for the bus industry. With a lifetime cost of around &#163;100&#160;billion and a peak cost of around &#163;4&#160;billion a year, Trident renewal, which we oppose on moral, economic and strategic grounds, could be achieved only at the expense of conventional defence programmes and procurement.</p><p>The choice that is facing Scotland is clear.

Ultimately, however, the debate is between those who value opportunities and rise to challenges and those for whom the glass is always half empty, even when it is crystal clear&#8212;as is now widely acknowledged&#8212;that Scotland can be a successful independent country.</p><p>A small country such as Scotland has an abundance of opportunity laid out before it. We need to ensure that we take advantage of it. One example of how we could do that is set out in the Scottish Government&#8217;s &#8220;A Jobs Plan for an Independent Scotland&#8221;.

What I found impressive in the report was the conclusion that, under the union, in terms of economic growth, Scotland has underperformed relative to the UK as a whole and relative to other small countries including Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland and Portugal. Also, in the 30-year period to 2007, we have had an annual percentage growth of 2.3 per cent, compared with 2.8 per cent for the UK as a whole. That growth rate has been broadly similar since then.</p><p>However, in the longer term, as the fiscal commission reports, growth depends on productivity. In that respect, the UK record remains poor. Although Scotland has closed the relative gap with RUK, we remain behind key competitors such as the United States of America, Germany and France, which John Swinney referred to. I recognise, of course, that we need to make it clear that we need to have the right balance of growth so that we have growth that reduces inequality.</p><p>Historically, we have also had a lack of growth in population&#8212;as Kenny Gibson mentioned&#8212;particularly compared with RUK. That lack of growth has seemed to change in recent years and we know, of course, that a modest increase in the number of people&#8212;particularly young people&#8212;staying in Scotland each year could have a significant impact not only on dependency ratios but on growth itself.</p><p>We also know that although Professor Stiglitz might not be a fan of reducing corporation tax, he concludes that countries that are more unequal do not do as well as, do not grow as well as, and are less stable than those that are more equal.</p><p>In the debate today, speakers including Jamie Hepburn have talked eloquently of the nature of inequality in Scotland. Although I accept that there is no guarantee that an independent Scotland will be a more equal society, I think that there is every prospect that it will be. Indeed, some of the no campaigners seem to be positively fearful of that possibility.</p><p>Independence gives us a unique opportunity to change the kind of society that we are. On Saturday, I met a voter in my constituency who will be voting yes because he wants to see a revolution in Scotland&#8217;s health record which, in his view, would have a knock-on economic effect. He believes that&#8212;leaving aside the impact of the privatisation of the NHS down south&#8212;independence offers opportunities that the status quo simply does not offer.</p><p>When we speak of the risks of independence, let us also remember the letter to the Financial Times last week from Jim Spowart and others, which said that those who seek to evaluate risk in the financial sector must take account of the far more significant risk that is posed to financial services by the prospect of a UK exit from the EU.</p><p>We should also never forget the key mantra of the Westminster Government in this referendum campaign: &#8220;No pre-negotiation&#8221;. Of course, that fits very nicely with the agenda of raising doubts and uncertainty as a key campaigning tool, which we have heard in the chamber today. Of course, a position of there being no pre-negotiation means that there can be no definitive answers on many key issues. However, it is on the currency issue alone that the Westminster Government decided to make its position known&#8212;supposedly in a spirit of giving the facts to the Scottish people on this very important issue. Of course, that is not pre-negotiation. Rather, that is what Westminster says, and obviously, if it says it, it is right. What is right that the Opposition parties will fight to the death following a yes vote in order to ensure a currency union, because that is best for Scotland.

I am not a member of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, but I have read the bill with interest. I note that David Stewart is a man of many talents, which he displayed earlier this afternoon and last night, when I watched with interest the proceedings of the cross-party group on diabetes, which he convenes. He is a busy man.</p><p>It is fair to say that, from an architectural point of view, Scotland has a lot of history. Edinburgh, our capital, is an architect&#8217;s dream, with medieval buildings standing side by side with Victorian terraces, Georgian town houses, and modern homes, offices and retail outlets made from glass and steel.</p><p>Buildings are made from perishable materials and they begin to crumble over time. As David Stewart&#8217;s consultation paper pointed out, we are sometimes reminded of that in the most tragic circumstances. The case of Australian student Christine Foster, who was working in Edinburgh&#8217;s west end in 2000 when she was killed by falling masonry, is a sad reminder that buildings in a poor state of repair can be fatal.</p><p>The fatal accident inquiry that followed the incident asked the City of Edinburgh Council to carry out</p><p>&#8220;an immediate audit of those buildings within the city thought to constitute a risk to public safety&#8221;.</p><p>Next Saturday it will be exactly 14 years since Christine Foster was killed. We owe it to the many people who have been killed or who have suffered injury as a result of defective and dangerous buildings to ensure that the legislation that we design to prevent such incidents is robust and effective. I hope that the bill will play a part in that regard.</p><p>The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 gave local authorities powers to repair dangerous buildings, under sections 29 and 30 and to repair defective buildings, under section 28. As we know, if a building is considered to be dangerous to its occupants, a council must require the occupants to leave the building and can subsequently carry out any work that it deems necessary to make the building safe. Alternatively, the council may serve a dangerous building notice on the owner, if it does not intend to carry out repairs itself.</p><p>Likewise, a council can issue a defective building notice, requiring the owner of a defective building, which is defined as a building that requires repair to prevent significant deterioration of its fabric, to make repairs in a defined timescale.</p><p>It is of course the case that we are living in an age of huge financial constraint, if not austerity, and councils cannot possibly carry out a significant volume of building repairs without recouping the outlays that they incur in the process. David Stewart rightly pointed out that in that regard the 2003 act has not been effective. Charging order provisions under the 1959 act were not carried forward and the enforcement regime did not work as well as it might have done. Councils face significant monetary losses as a result of unrecovered debts.</p><p>I listened to Alex Rowley, and I note that Fife Council, in its submission on the financial memorandum, noted the lack of a proactive approach to defective buildings and said that there was a large repairs backlog to contend with. There are challenges.</p><p>It is true that perhaps the biggest barrier to councils exercising their powers to repair dangerous buildings are the legal difficulties that they face when it comes to recovering debts. I am pleased that the charging order provisions in section 1 of the bill will mark a significant improvement on the existing situation. Undoubtedly they will give more flexibility to the council and to the building owner with the aim of ensuring that the debt is repaid.</p><p>It is fair to point out that there was criticism of the initial 30-year repayment period and term of the charging order, and I am pleased that some flexibility was given to local authorities at stage 2. However, it must be the case that a gradual recovery over several years is far better than no repayment at all. I am also pleased by the amendments at stage 2 and at stage 3, the effect of which will be to encourage local authorities to register charges promptly. It must not be forgotten that arrangements can be made to allow charging orders to be discharged earlier.</p><p>I am pleased to support the bill at stage 3 and welcome its progress into legislation.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Buildings (Recovery of Expenses) (Scotland) Bill"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p></p><p>1.

What if the Cuban missile crisis and, specifically, the boats of the Soviet Union that carried intercontinental ballistic missiles had taken a different turn in 1962? What if tensions between India and Pakistan had escalated further than any of us dared imagine? What if the world, instead of peacefully retreating from the cold war, had engaged in nuclear war?</p><p>For years, we knew that the world was prepared for nuclear war but only since the end of the cold war have we learned just how prepared we were. While the British Government might have had the capacity to order a nuclear strike, it is only in recent decades that we have learned exactly how it would have operated&#8212;in underground facilities such as Scotland&#8217;s secret bunker at Troywood near Anstruther.</p><p>In addition to Troywood, we now know that there were bunkers at Barnton quarry near Edinburgh and at Cultybraggan near Comrie. A vast number remain unknown or closed to the public, making Scotland&#8217;s secret bunker, for the moment, an unrivalled tourist attraction in Scotland.</p><p>Situated 100ft underground, the bunker hosts 24,000 square feet of accommodation that would have become home to members of the British Government, specifically the Secretary of State and Minister of State for Scotland, had the country been subjected to nuclear strikes. A 3 tonne blast door at the end of a 150m tunnel, secluded underneath an ordinary-looking farmhouse in rural north-east Fife, hosts what would have been the command centre and living quarters of people who were considered to be essential personnel in Scotland. In the past, they would have included such people as secretaries of state Arthur Woodburn, Willie Ross or Malcolm Rifkind, in a room containing no less than a substantial box of King Edward cigars. Other bunker inhabitants would have included up to 300 other personnel including civil servants and members of the emergency services. With concrete up to 3m thick, reinforced by inch-thick tungsten rods every 15cm, there is a peculiar irony to watching public information messages inside the museum that inform people how to turn their homes into fallout shelters by using dining tables and sofa cushions if they cannot access the more luxurious and sturdy options of sandbags and planks of wood.</p><p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of the opening of the bunker as a tourist attraction following an extensive refurbishment that has included opening access to previously unseen areas of the bunker. James Mitchell, owner of the bunker and the Barnton quarry nuclear bunker, recently said that its reopening would</p><p>&#8220;help bring the bunker to life for our visitors&#8221;</p><p>following investment in a series of information screens throughout the museum that will soon go live. He has also spoken of how the bunker shows</p><p>&#8220;just how recent and real the threat was, and just how prepared we were.&#8221;</p><p>Initially serving as an early warning radar station to warn of attack from the USSR, the R3 type bunker was built in 1951 and used by the Royal Air Force as a Rotor station between 1953 and 1956. When the technology became redundant, the Ministry of Defence mothballed the site for two years before the Civil Defence Corps moved in between 1958 and 1968. After the withdrawal of the Civil Defence Corps, the MOD established Troywood, as the bunker is known, as a regional Government headquarters before it was finally decommissioned in 1993. The bunker is therefore different from the Cultybraggan bunker, which was completed in 1990 specifically for the purpose of being a nuclear shelter.</p><p>The RAF, Civil Defence Corps and the Royal Observer Corps all occupied the bunker at Troywood at one time or another, and the ROC had a long, distinguished history in the bunker. It was therefore with &#8220;anger and disappointment&#8221; that Air Commodore GM Boddy announced the standing down of the ROC in September 1991.</p><p>I associate myself with the comments made by James Mitchell in relation to the reality of the risk that once faced this country and the world. Having visited the bunker, I know that it is remarkable to see the preparations that were in place and just how seriously the world took the concept of mutually assured destruction during the cold war. As an example, a previously classified document from the Joint Intelligence Committee in 1967 is on display. It notes that Pitreavie, Rosyth, RAF Leuchars and Troywood, all in Fife, were four potential targets for the USSR. The committee suggested that an attack on Troywood would require four 1 megaton bombs, and to destroy all four targets would require 12 0.5 or 1 megaton bombs, which would have been the equivalent of dropping 1,100 Hiroshima bombs. More frightening is the approximation that a 1 megaton strike on Torness power station would have rendered Fife and the Lothians uninhabitable for centuries.</p><p>Interestingly, Scotland&#8217;s secret bunker is not the only bunker that has been opened as a tourist attraction. There are plans to open the Barnton quarry bunker in the near future, and there are other similar tourist destinations in England. Cultybraggan, on the other hand, will be used for data storage.</p><p>I am delighted that Scotland&#8217;s secret bunker, which hosts tens of thousands of tourists every year, has thrown open its blastproof doors to the public for the 20th year in succession. Even after all this time, it is still able to unearth new treasures of interest. There is more to be uncovered and the museum is always on the lookout for any information or loans of materials that could be used in its displays. That said, it is interesting to note that there are doors in the museum that are still sealed to the public because what lies behind them is classified under the Official Secrets Act. They are so well sealed that even the catflap for the resident cat, Cleo, cannot be opened.</p><p>The museum contains a cafe that is certainly atmospheric. It has the feel of the 50s and 60s, down to the music of Ketty Lester and Jim Reeves. When I was there with some somewhat younger members of the public, they had no idea who either Ketty Lester or Jim Reeves were; time moves on.</p><p>I believe that the thought of nuclear war is so alien to many people who were born after the fall of the Berlin wall and the dissolution of the USSR that nuclear war resembles more closely what happens in the scripts of video games such as &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221; than the real world. Times have changed. Since July 1994, the bunker has even played host to weddings.</p><p>Artefacts&#8212;that is what they now are&#8212;such as Scotland&#8217;s secret bunker serve as a valuable reminder that the world balanced precariously close to nuclear disaster and that it was prepared for nuclear disaster. Mercifully, Troywood was never used for its intended purpose.</p><p>I hope that the upgrades will help the secret bunker museum to boost its tourist numbers this season and in future seasons, and that it will continue to serve as one of the most fascinating premier attractions in North East Fife. I say to members who have not been there that it is well worth a visit.</p><p>I thank everybody who stayed for the debate.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Secret Bunker"}, {"date": "2014-06-04", "body": "<p></p><p>3.

On the first, it is right to say that the evidence that we received was supportive of Scotland&#8217;s membership of the EU. Although we considered possible Scottish membership of the European economic area or EFTA, the disadvantages of such a move&#8212;for example, the requirement to accept a body of law without having any political say, not to mention the requirement to make a financial contribution to the EU without representation&#8212;were apparent.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s attitude to Europe was felt to be less Eurosceptic. I do not think that that position has changed with last week&#8217;s election. In that context, although much is made of the UK Independence Party&#8217;s poor performance in London, I believe that it got 16.7 per cent of the vote there, which is more than twice as much as it polled in Scotland&#8217;s capital city of Edinburgh.</p><p>The main division of opinion that the committee heard concerned Scotland&#8217;s route to membership of the EU, which was theme 2. The points that I would emphasise from the great article 48 versus article 49 debate are that the treaties are silent on Scotland&#8217;s precise position&#8212;that is not disputed&#8212;and that the scenario predicated on a yes vote in September has not been put to the European Commission. If the UK Government really wanted greater clarity, it could put that request to the Commission.</p><p>Moreover, even supporters of article 49, such as Professor Kenneth Armstrong, who is professor of European law at the University of Cambridge, agreed that negotiations could commence immediately after a yes vote. The idea that nothing will happen for 18 months after a yes vote is simply not tenable. Doing nothing simply risks blowing a hole in the single market, which is in no one&#8217;s interests. The idea that Scotland would somehow find itself in March 2016 in the position of having 5 million-plus EU citizens without rights because of their residence seems unrealistic. That includes 160,000 citizens of the EU at the present time, of course. One matter that came across loud and clear was that EU citizens have rights over and beyond the rights of citizens of individual member states, and seeking to deprive those citizens of rights might inevitably lead to legal proceedings in the European Court of Justice.</p><p>What was absolutely fundamental about Sir David Edward&#8217;s evidence is that the EU treaties create a new legal order of international law that differs from conventional international law. The cabinet secretary has already referred to that. We set that out on page 29 of our report. It was not incorporated in the committee&#8217;s initial draft report. I am still waiting for any coherent explanation from Opposition members as to why they sought to prevent that from being incorporated in our final report. It is not about SNP bias; it is about having proper regard to the evidence of perhaps the most distinguished practitioner on these matters that we have in Scotland. The European commissioner Viviane Reding described him as one of the great architects of Europe.</p><p>On Schengen and the common travel area, we heard no evidence to suggest that any member state would oppose Scotland&#8217;s membership of the common travel area. The comments that we have heard in the press about border controls being necessary if Scotland were to be so bold as to have an immigration policy that was different from that of the rest of the UK have come from people such as the Home Secretary, Theresa May. I do not believe that those matters cannot be negotiated. I noticed that Alistair Carmichael studiously avoided banging that drum in his appearance before the committee.</p><p>Let us remember that Scotland is not seeking to reopen the EU budget for the next financial period and that, like the rest of the UK, it will, of course, be a net contributor.</p><p>I accept, of course, that some witnesses found the 18-month timetable that the Scottish Government has put forward to be unrealistic. It is certainly tight, but I believe that it is doable. Instead of talking about queues for membership, it would be much more positive if David Cameron and others, having indicated that they will support Scotland&#8217;s membership&#8212;we are grateful for that&#8212;outlined what they will do to facilitate that membership in the event of a yes vote.</p><p>Theme 3 of the committee&#8217;s report deals with the role of small states in the European Union. &#8220;Small&#8221; simply means having fewer than the average number of votes in the European Council. On that basis, Scotland would be one of 21 small states out of 29 states in the EU, as the European Movement in Scotland pointed out in written evidence. So far, there is nothing unusual about Scotland; it is just one of many small states.</p><p>On the role of small states generally, it is worth remembering that, without Scotland, the rest of the UK would still qualify as a large state, while Scotland would be a small state. The European Council&#8217;s weighting for qualified majority voting determines that large states have 27 to 29 votes and small states have three to four votes. Therefore, when there is a common interest, the combined votes of Scotland and the UK could be marginally greater. The same general principle could apply to the European Parliament, in which Scotland has only six MEPs, whereas Ireland currently has 12, for example, although I accept, of course, that there is a current limit on the number of MEPs.</p><p>In addition to co-operating when there are shared interests, the whole point of having more direct Scottish representation in the EU institutions is that we can pursue policies that are right for Scotland when we do not share Westminster&#8217;s priorities. As Professor Michael Keating said, Scotland may wish to take a different path from the UK on agriculture, as Ireland generally does. However, we heard evidence from Dara Murphy, who is a member of the Irish Parliament. He said:</p><p>&#8220;It is fair to say that our best relationship in the EU is with the UK. There are many reasons for that. We share so many objectives and targets with the UK, and on most issues Ireland and the UK share a common position ... We all know the history, but now when we go into Europe, we go in as equal partners and member states.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, European and External Relations Committee, 27 February 2014; c 1860.]</p><p>That is the way that I perceive Scotland proceeding.</p><p>The committee also heard evidence from Jim Currie, whose general view is that small nations in the European Union are at their most effective when they choose their targets carefully. Small nations need to prioritise and network, something that I have no doubt Scotland is well equipped to do.</p><p>I would have preferred the committee&#8217;s comprehensive report to have had no conclusion in order to leave readers to reach their own conclusions on it.

I welcome the chairman, the vice-chair and members of the guild and distinguished guests to the public gallery.</p><p>On such an historic occasion as the anniversary to celebrate an impressive 125 years, it seems proper to note the relationship that Kirkcaldy in particular has had with the showmen. The links market, which takes place on Kirkcaldy esplanade every year, has a history that stretches back to 1305 and has entertained the residents of the lang toun and surrounding areas for centuries. The links market can boast of being the longest street fair in Europe, and the length of time for which our community in Kirkcaldy has benefited from the showmen&#8217;s involvement shows that they are an integral part of the people in our town and should be celebrated accordingly.</p><p>Although this year marks the 125th year of the Showmen&#8217;s Guild, showmen have been entertaining at the links market for more than 700 years. This centuries-old tie to our community has become an important part of the town&#8217;s heritage and gives me great confidence that the work of the Showmen&#8217;s Guild will continue to bring the links market to Kirkcaldy for years to come. Undoubtedly, it also continues to raise the national profile of the lang toun every year.</p><p>I must confess that my love for the links market is more of an obsession. As someone who grew up only a street away from the site, I know from experience how hotly anticipated its arrival was every year by many of the locals. The smell and the sound were like magnets not only to me but to young children and teenagers from all around. Sixpence a day for school dinners and threepence for the tuck shop were saved up and carefully hidden away weeks in advance, such was my determination to be able to enjoy all the wonderful and thrilling rides and stalls beckoning to me, especially the one with the toffee apples. Sandwiches were made up the night before so that at least I had something to eat at school.</p><p>When I was not allowed to go to the market, the excuse was always, &#8220;I&#8217;m away out to play football, Mum.&#8221; Mum would say, &#8220;Okay, but you&#8217;d better not be going down the links market&#8212;you&#8217;re too young!&#8221; &#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to play football, Mum. I&#8217;m not going near it,&#8221; was always my response. &#8220;You&#8217;d better not, or you&#8217;re in big trouble.&#8221; With my mum&#8217;s warning ringing in my ears, off I went to the market, oblivious to the consequences later on. The old speedway, octopus and metro&#8212;what a great night with my friends. Then I went back up the road in time, so that I was safe&#8212;or so I thought. Mum: &#8220;You&#8217;ve been down the links market!&#8221; Me: &#8220;No, I&#8217;ve been playing football, Mum.&#8221; Mum: &#8220;You&#8217;ve been down the links market.&#8221; Unbeknown to me, the toffee apple that I could not resist on the way home had left its mark all over my face, so it was off to bed with Mum&#8217;s wrath at my heels.</p><p>On a more serious note, showmen of Scotland have been facing some difficult times over the past years, and to their credit members of the guild have been working extremely hard to try to resolve many of the problems that their members have encountered, with help from the cross-party group. It has been active both in the Parliament and in local authority areas and has covered a wide range of issues. It appears to be with the 32 local authorities in Scotland that the showmen encounter most of their problems. From the loss of sites to obstructions that are put in their way and planning applications for funfairs, issues have impacted severely on showmen&#8217;s ability to entertain and trade.</p><p>It seems that all of the 32 local authorities have their own rules and regulations in managing showmen and their fairs, but the most contentious issue is without doubt licensing and the conditions that local authorities attach. In Fife, the council charges a reasonable &#163;100 for a licence for the links market, which is the longest street fair in Europe. That is surely an example of good practice. In other local authority areas in Scotland, licence costs range from a few hundred pounds to thousands, and all for a simple piece of paper to allow showmen to entertain. That and other issues with public entertainment licences cause showmen no end of problems that do not exist south of the border, where showmen travelling from across the United Kingdom are on a level playing field.</p><p>In an attempt to alleviate the licensing problems that showmen face, I urge the Scottish Government to look at the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 and to consider amending it with a view to exempting travelling funfairs.</p><p>Due to the Showmen&#8217;s Guild&#8217;s strong connections with Kirkcaldy, I have asked Fife Council whether it will host a civic reception to honour the organisation&#8217;s long-standing commitment to the town. I hope that I will be able to join Fife Council and the local community in celebrating this momentous year with the members of an organisation that has historically maintained such close ties to Kirkcaldy.</p><p>Once again, I congratulate the Showmen&#8217;s Guild of Scotland on reaching its 125th anniversary. I am certain that it will continue to represent the best interests of showmen across Scotland for years to come and I particularly look forward to seeing its relationship with Kirkcaldy flourish. I take this opportunity to wish the Showmen&#8217;s Guild all the very best for the future.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Showmen&#8217;s Guild (125th Anniversary)"}, {"date": "2014-06-12", "body": "<p></p><p>9.

It is my pleasure to have the opportunity today to speak about the Asda community life programme&#8212;especially the community life programme in my constituency, which is Kirkcaldy. I have had a particular interest in the project since its inception in 2012, as it offers support to a wide range of community-centred third sector organisations in my constituency.</p><p>Despite being part of a multinational corporation, Asda has shown great interest in actively contributing to local community life. For several years now, Asda has played a vital role in supporting the vast number of voluntary organisations that operate in Scotland&#8212;organisations that aim to enhance social cohesion among citizens&#8212;as well as strengthening local participation in local charities.</p><p>According to the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, there are about 45,000 voluntary organisations in Scotland, half of which are registered charities. It is crucial that we understand that a vast number of those organisations are small community-based initiatives that often lack the necessary framework to promote their good cause.</p><p>Inspired to provide assistance for such local organisations, Asda established the community life programme. At the outset, the overarching goal of the programme was to combine several smaller support measures that were taking place in each store. To achieve that, a community life champion was introduced to every Asda supermarket. Their main task is to regulate all charitable work in their local store. Community life champions work in partnership with voluntary and charity groups to help them to develop fundraising strategies.</p><p>In addition, Asda provides the third sector organisations with access to meeting rooms, foyers, training rooms, cafes and car parks at their local stores. Not surprisingly, many voluntary groups welcome the opportunity to make use of Asda&#8217;s facilities to hold fundraising events and to inform the public about their work.</p><p>Fundraising events in Asda stores are dedicated to numerous good causes, ranging from renovating care homes and nurseries to helping local community groups to grow their own fruit and vegetables. More than 100,000 students from Scottish primary schools have visited Asda stores to learn about environmentally friendly living and healthy nutrition. Such generous help provides many organisations with access to facilities that they would otherwise lack.</p><p>The community life programme is a huge success. Statistics indicate that since 2012 stores across Scotland have raised about &#163;2.6&#160;million. Asda&#8217;s community life champions have participated in more than 36,000 hours of volunteering, and voluntary groups have used Asda stores 3,627 times as community centres.</p><p>In 2013, Asda&#8217;s efforts for the community were honoured when the company was awarded the large company of the year award, the building stronger communities local impact award and the volunteer of the year award at the Scottish Business in the Community awards.</p><p>The Asda superstore in my constituency of Kirkcaldy has certainly contributed to those remarkable achievements. The vigorous commitment of the store&#8217;s manager, Stephen Gallagher, and community life champion, Jean Ritchie, has made it possible to have raised more than &#163;27,000 for local good causes last year. Therefore, I extend particular gratitude to both of them, as well as to their colleagues, for their strong dedication to Kirkcaldy&#8217;s community life.</p><p>The list of voluntary organisations and charities in Kirkcaldy that have benefited from the community life programme is long. I wish to highlight several projects with which I am particularly affiliated. One of them is the Linton Lane Centre. That organisation supports the needs of local residents of all age groups by offering activities for enjoyment and education, including children&#8217;s programmes, youth clubs, dance classes, family support groups, sports training courses and senior citizens clubs.</p><p>In 2012, Asda played a key role in fundraising &#163;17,376 for the Linton Lane Centre, which enabled it to expand its service spectrum. Part of the Linton Lane Centre is the grey panthers club, which is a voluntary initiative that is dedicated to setting up events for active senior citizens. Grey panthers has been working in partnership with Asda&#8217;s community life programme in organising tea dances. Asda regularly donates a selection of cakes and scones for the dances, and has been extremely supportive in preparing the hall for the event.</p><p>Asda not only offers facilities to local non-profit organisations, but supports them financially through funds that are made available by the Asda Foundation. Each year &#163;100,000 is reserved for voluntary organisations, which customers nominate and vote for. On a regular basis, customers choose three charitable organisations or local community groups that they think are worthy of a donation. The initiative&#8212;called &#8220;chosen by you given by us&#8221;&#8212;has attracted significant attention from the public and is highly popular in my constituency. In January it was my pleasure to hand over cheques for the three winners of the &#8220;chosen by you given by us&#8221; scheme in Kirkcaldy. The winning organisation&#8212;Cash for Kids&#8212;was selected by local customers in November and December and received a total of &#163;202.55 from the Asda Foundation.</p><p>I want to draw members&#8217; attention to Asda&#8217;s tickled pink campaign, which raises money for two breast cancer charities: Breast Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Campaign. Tickled pink was launched 18 years ago and has collected about &#163;38&#160;million. It is an amazing initiative that I have been supporting for several years. In September, I assisted the 5th Fife scout group in bag packing at Asda in Kirkcaldy. It was wonderful to see how excited the scouts were about fundraising. In four hours of bag packing, &#163;447.93 was collected for breast cancer prevention, treatment and research.</p><p>Later in the same month I joined Jean Ritchie, Asda Kirkcaldy&#8217;s community life champion, and Fiona Lockett, who is a health promotion officer at NHS Fife, to sell raffle tickets for a tombola to raise money for tickled pink. The day was a huge success and &#163;339.33 was raised. Fiona Lockett said:</p><p>&#8220;Asda are always so community focused and enthusiastic that working in partnership with them is always fun. I was pleased to be given the opportunity to highlight this issue in the store on &#8216;Tickled Pink Day&#8217; and to bring it to the attention of the members of the public.&#8221;</p><p>Ms Lockett&#8217;s comment provides an excellent summary of Asda Kirkcaldy&#8217;s dedication to strengthening and interacting with local community life. It is not a matter of course that such a big company cares about its customers in the way that Asda does, so Asda deserves our gratitude and support for offering its facilities to voluntary non-profit organisations.</p><p>I thank Stephen Gallagher and Jean Ritchie again. I wish them and their team the best of luck for a successful continuation of the community life programme.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Asda Kirkcaldy Community Life Programme"}, {"date": "2014-03-13", "body": "<p>I thank Claire Baker for bringing the motion to Parliament and I welcome the members of Greener Kirkcaldy to the gallery.</p><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk about Greener Kirkcaldy, because I have been following the project for several years. The community-focused organisation first opened its doors in 2009 after receiving funding through the Scottish Government&#8217;s climate challenge fund. Since that day, Greener Kirkcaldy has supported individuals, families and companies in reducing their carbon footprints and fuel bills. The free and individualised advice that is offered by the organisation has truly helped many of my constituents.</p><p>Considering that all major energy companies significantly increased their prices in 2013, I believe that the work that is done by Greener Kirkcaldy is of even greater importance. Statistics indicate that simple measures to save energy can have a huge impact. They include actions ranging from being more conscious about a household&#8217;s energy consumption to adapting homes to modern environmental standards. For example, the addition of 270mm of loft insulation can reduce annual heating costs by up to &#163;175. That sum of money could make an incredible difference to vulnerable families in the community. Cognisant of such potential savings, an ever-increasing number of people are interested in reducing their carbon footprint and thereby cutting fuel bills. Accordingly, Greener Kirkcaldy has seen an increase in individuals seeking advice, with a record high of 1,030 cases between October and December 2013.</p><p>Integral to the success of Greener Kirkcaldy is its flexible and personalised approach to offering support. People who are seeking help can contact the advice centre directly and attend events and talks organised by Greener Kirkcaldy, as well as ask for an in-depth home energy advice visit. During such visits, a wide range of topics is discussed, including needs for implementing insulation and options for using renewable energy or switching tariffs.</p><p>Moreover, the organisation not only aims to treat each client equally, but develops individually tailored solutions for each case. The hundreds of people who contact Greener Kirkcaldy every month provide many examples that perfectly illustrate that philosophy. On my visit to Greener Kirkcaldy last Friday, I was made aware of two special cases that highlight how beneficial the organisation&#8217;s work is to many families.</p><p>An elderly lady in my constituency was concerned about her husband&#8217;s medical condition making a home visit from Greener Kirkcaldy complicated. However, the couple were reassured and allowed an energy adviser to visit their semi-detached house. During the visit, the family were advised to implement basic draught proofing. Shortly after a decision was taken to do that, the organisation&#8217;s free handyman service installed radiator panels, draught proofing, LED light bulbs and a thermal door curtain. The couple were extremely pleased by how simple and uncomplicated it was to put into practice the advice that Greener Kirkcaldy gave and they have successfully reduced their fuel bills.</p><p>Reducing the share of expenditure that is reserved for fuel bills was also the main concern of a single mother who approached Greener Kirkcaldy last July. She lived in a privately rented house and had to minimise heating to keep her fuel costs low. As she faced another winter in a cold house, she was determined to change her situation and improve her heating system. An energy adviser from Greener Kirkcaldy visited her and identified the old boiler and a lack of insulation that allowed heat to escape as the main causes of high fuel costs. She was made aware that, because of her limited financial possibilities, she could qualify for a boiler upgrade as well as free insulation from the affordable warmth scheme that is offered through the Energy Saving Trust. Thrilled by those options, she applied to receive assistance and, only four days after the initial call, her home was provided with cavity wall insulation.</p><p>Besides helping people to create environmentally friendly homes, Greener Kirkcaldy has launched a diverse set of projects to promote greener living, which include running an eco-shop, establishing an orchard and working in co-operation with schools. Working in conjunction with schools has proven to be a successful strategy in educating young people on basic energy-saving methods and the importance of buying locally sourced food. I hope that they will take that knowledge into adulthood, which will benefit not only their communities but the wider environment. Regular workshops for interested citizens of all age groups are being held at Ravenscraig walled garden, where they are shown how to grow their own vegetables, fruit and herbs.</p><p>The Greener Kirkcaldy team participated in celebrating national climate week last week. Members and volunteers intensified their efforts to approach the citizens of Kirkcaldy directly, and the handyman service and energy advisers gave families further advice on how to make their homes cosier and more environmentally friendly. In particular, they addressed mothers by giving them tips on how to cut fuel bills.</p><p>I commend Greener Kirkcaldy&#8217;s great work in promoting more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient living in my constituency. The organisation is an excellent example of a successful community-led project and I wish all its members and volunteers the best of luck for the future.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Greener Kirkcaldy"}, {"date": "2014-03-05", "body": "<p>I thank Linda Fabiani for bringing the motion to Parliament and welcome the opportunity to talk about Marie Curie Cancer Care&#8217;s great daffodil appeal 2014.</p><p>As one of the UK&#8217;s largest charities, Marie Curie Cancer Care has endeavoured to raise money every year since 1986 to support those who suffer from terminal illness. I believe that everyone who is unfortunate enough to be faced with that diagnosis has a right to high-quality, patient-friendly and emotionally supportive palliative care. Marie Curie Cancer Care undoubtedly fulfils those criteria by delivering high-quality services while prioritising patients&#8217; wishes. In providing free end-of-life care, it plays a significant role for patients in allowing them to choose the kind of end-of-life care they would prefer. That choice provides care that puts patients and their families first and allows patients to die in their homes surrounded by their loved ones if that is what they want.</p><p>Despite that exemplary work, every five minutes in the UK someone dies without getting the care that they deserve. According to research that was commissioned by Marie Curie, 65 per cent of the people concerned would choose to die at home. However, the reality is that only 25 per cent receive the opportunity to do so. Providing more palliative care at home would ease the burden on the healthcare system. Statistical data from 2013 estimates that if community services were put in place for 30,000 more patients, the potential saving to the NHS would be as high as &#163;34 million.</p><p>The great daffodil appeal is of such great importance because it not only raises money to provide nursing for those affected by terminal illnesses but helps to develop strategies to tackle successfully the challenges facing an ageing society. As with most areas in Scotland, my constituency of Kirkcaldy is confronted with finding solutions for sustaining an effective healthcare system for the increasing number of citizens who are aged over 75. At the moment, Marie Curie Cancer Care is in partnership with NHS Fife to deliver suitable services for around 3,000 people requiring palliative care. However, a majority of them still die in hospital, which shows the potential for further increasing home nursing in the future.</p><p>Cognisant of those statistics, Marie Curie Cancer Care and NHS Scotland, with the help of Michael Matheson, the Minister for Public Health, recently launched a new initiative in Kirkcaldy called the helper programme, which is due to begin in Fife on 1 April. The aim of the programme is to further improve palliative services by training volunteers who will provide companionship and emotional support for at least three hours each week to at least 240 patients a year. After a pilot trial in Fife, the initiative will be expanded to the rest of the country, thus strengthening the partnership between the volunteer community and the NHS.</p><p>Volunteers are also integral to the success of the great daffodil appeal. Their efforts in raising awareness of the importance of palliative care and helping to foster support for the terminally ill and the Marie Curie organisation itself by encouraging people to wear a daffodil pin are of paramount importance in the collection of the &#163;4 million that is raised every year in Scotland. Last year, I was fortunate enough to be able to join the volunteers at the Marie Curie Cancer Care stand in the Mercat shopping centre in Kirkcaldy. I was heartened and pleased by the generosity of shoppers. At the end of the day, the collection tins were filled with donations. I will be helping again with this year&#8217;s appeal.</p><p>I wish Marie Curie Cancer Care and all volunteers who are involved across Scotland the best of luck in the great daffodil appeal 2014. Their efforts truly deserve our full gratitude and support. I offer my family&#8217;s gratitude to Marie Curie&#8217;s staff and volunteers because, for the second time in a short space of time, we will be calling on their services.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Marie Curie Cancer Care"}, {"date": "2014-02-20", "body": "<p>I thank John Mason for addressing the issue of families who are affected by alcohol, drugs and other substance misuse. Given Scotland&#8217;s extremely high rate of people addicted to alcohol and drugs, it is crucial that we tackle all aspects related to substance misuse; one such aspect is support for the family members of those who are affected.</p><p>Most will be familiar with the Scottish Government&#8217;s briefing paper on promoting family recovery, which provides a framework for effective recovery measures. However, recovery is a broad concept and effective recovery involves not only supporting the clients who seek help but considering the importance of a client&#8217;s social environment. No matter whether we are talking about partners, family or friends, they all play a crucial role in the recovery process. We must recognise that only by taking into account all aspects related to reducing substance misuse can we make progress in lowering the number of those involved.</p><p>This afternoon, I want to raise awareness of those who are related to problem drug users. Although developing family support is a necessary step, we tend to forget about the relatives and friends who suffer as a result of the extensive effects that addictions often cause and it is essential that we provide them with the protection and support that they need to help them deal with the consequences of having a person with problem drug use in their family.</p><p>At the moment, around 52,000 Scots suffer from alcohol and drug addictions. Unfortunately, some who witness a parent misusing in their childhood will carry that burden throughout their life. In Scotland, the estimate for the number of children who are affected in this way is around 40,000 to 60,000. The devastating impact of such an experience on a child&#8217;s life is indisputable. Negative outcomes associated with parental drug abuse include decreased wellbeing and difficulties in achieving full educational potential, which could create obstacles to future employment. In addition, affected children are often exposed to higher risk of emotional and physical abuse.</p><p>Although statistical data collected within the Fife region indicates that alcohol and drug misuse is slightly lower than the Scottish average, that does not mean that we do not face the same challenges as the rest of the country. People in Fife have recognised the urgency of reducing alcohol and substance misuse and are particularly keen on reducing its profound impact on so many people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>In 2009, the Fife alcohol and drug partnership was established with the intention of improving community planning between local government, NHS Fife and third sector organisations. The strategy includes identifying and protecting those who are most likely to be affected by others&#8217; substance misuse and aims to increase the number of services that create a safer and more supportive home environment for those vulnerable target groups. In 2013-14, &#163;179,000 is being allocated towards achieving that goal. Indeed, the funding that was made available in 2012-13 allowed 37 children from 19 families to receive counselling and take part in various programmes. The figures show that, as a result of individual and group sessions, the impact of parental substance abuse on children was clearly reduced and parenting skills as well as family relationships were improved.</p><p>I want to highlight two organisations that receive funding from the Fife alcohol and drug partnership: the Drug and Alcohol Project Limited and Fife Alcohol Support Service. Those organisations provide an invaluable service in helping to support people who have been affected in some way by alcohol, drug and other substance misuse. DAPL has supported people in Fife with alcohol, drug and solvent misuse issues since 1994 and, in 2013, it started what has turned out to be an extremely successful summer programme for young people and their family members, the key goals of which are reinforcing family engagement and positive parenting.</p><p>Fife Alcohol Support Service, which is based in Kirkcaldy, offers counselling services to those who are affected by heavy alcohol consumption. In 2012-13, the organisation offered counselling sessions to 301 clients with the aim of addressing all the problems that arose from alcohol abuse. Among that number were several family members and friends who sought help with the drinking of someone in their social environment. Most of the individuals who received counselling had a remarkably positive response to the sessions and felt that their psychological wellbeing had improved significantly.</p><p>Even though a large number of charitable organisations are now well established in Fife and are co-operating with local government and the NHS through the drug and alcohol partnership, too many people are still suffering from the devastating effects of alcohol and drug abuse. As has been mentioned, children are particularly vulnerable. I think that we would all agree that no child deserves to be hindered in developing his or her full potential. The aim for the future is to identify and support each and every child who suffers from parental drug misuse, provide them with services that meet their needs and ensure that they grow up in a safe home environment.</p><p>I commend the dedicated work of DAPL and Fife Alcohol Support Service, which I believe to be truly beneficial to many of my constituents. I praise all other organisations that dedicate themselves to providing such valuable support services in Fife and throughout Scotland. I hope that those initiatives will be able to successfully continue their support services for all those who are affected directly or indirectly by substance misuse.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Promoting Family Recovery Across Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-02-06", "body": "<p></p><p>9.

The contributions and evidence they provided have proved invaluable and have allowed the committee to conduct what I believe is an in-depth examination of the current measures in place to prevent and tackle the sexual exploitation of children in Scotland.</p><p>I extend particular gratitude to Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland, which submitted the public petition that provided the impetus for our inquiry. Its engagement with the committee has been crucial, and I commend it for raising such an important issue with the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>The sexual exploitation of children has become a more prominent issue in recent years, largely due to extensive media coverage of child exploitation gangs in various parts of the UK. That has instigated a greater focus on the issue in Scotland, but more must be done to improve the ability of services to identify victims and potential victims of child sexual exploitation, to support those children and to target the predators.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report makes it clear that data collection on the prevalence of child sexual exploitation in Scotland is inconsistent and underresourced and that there is a need for improved data collection tools. However, from the information that is available, I was shocked to learn that many of the estimates of prevalence are relatively high. For example, according to case study research undertaken by the centre for excellence for looked-after children in Scotland, around one in four children in care is a victim of child sexual exploitation, and that figure is expected to be considerably higher for some of the most vulnerable groups. That alone indicates that we have much to learn as a nation about how to tackle this despicable crime.</p><p>One of the areas on which I would like to focus is the need for more widespread and comprehensive preventive education among young people. In today&#8217;s society, children are increasingly socialised into believing certain negative stereotypes about boys and girls and about what is normal behaviour in terms of sexual relationships. We need to address such attitudes at an early stage to reduce the risk of children thinking that it is normal or acceptable for anyone to coerce them into engaging in sexual behaviour.</p><p>Although there are already some examples of good practice in schools of educating children about healthy relationships, mutual respect and sexual boundaries, the committee found that there is a need to expand such practices much more widely in educational institutions and other youth settings across Scotland. The committee has been made aware of some excellent educational resources, such as those produced by Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland, that are already freely available. Many of them can be readily accessed via the website of the NWG Network&#8212;the national working group for sexually exploited children and young people.</p><p>Another aspect of the report that I would like to highlight is the lack of therapeutic and emotional support services available consistently throughout Scotland for young people affected by sexual exploitation. The committee found, throughout the course of our inquiry, that many young people feel that they have no one they can trust to confide in. It appears that there is often a general mistrust of social care workers among victims, due to a fear of being judged and labelled, which may be down to a lack of training and awareness in the sector. We need to break down those barriers or at least ensure the availability of alternative services such as ChildLine, which can offer valuable support when children feel that they have nowhere else to turn.</p><p>Connected to that issue is the provision of refuges for those who have broken free from child sexual exploitation and need a temporary base while they make contact with the services that can help them. The committee was informed that Scotland&#8217;s only such refuge for under-16s&#8212;run by Aberlour in the Glasgow area&#8212;closed in June 2013 and that there has been no facility in place since.</p><p>The availability of a safe place to go might significantly increase the likelihood of victims to seek help and might also play a key role in preventing the re-entry of children into sexual exploitation circles. I therefore strongly support the committee&#8217;s recommendation that consideration should be given to placing a duty on all local authorities to provide suitable refuges for the victims of child sexual exploitation.</p><p>The final matter I would like to address is the role of the third sector in preventing and tackling child sexual exploitation. Throughout the course of our inquiry, it has become overwhelmingly clear that charities and voluntary organisations make a significant contribution in this area. I believe that more must be done to acknowledge that and to support those organisations to continue the work that they do. Time and again, we have heard evidence that suggests that, without the support of organisations such as Barnardo&#8217;s, Eighteen and Under, Who Cares? Scotland and many others, victims of child sexual exploitation would not have been able to break free from abuse.</p><p>Third sector organisations appear to have an enhanced ability to build trust with young people who as a result become more likely to engage with other support services. We should use the expertise and experience of the third sector to co-ordinate our efforts to tackle child sexual exploitation at a national level.</p><p>In that context, a major element is the need to improve the sharing of intelligence about alleged perpetrators between police and the third sector. Third-sector organisations seem to have a distinct advantage in that regard, due to their capacity to gain victims&#8217; trust. Good examples of such practice include the partnership between Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland and police in Renfrewshire, and the multi-agency approach that Glasgow child protection committee has adopted. If we can develop co-ordination with the third sector across the board, it seems likely that we will see significant benefits in outcomes for children and in the identification of offenders and the rate of prosecution.</p><p>I am a member of the Public Petitions Committee, and my experience of the inquiry has been both harrowing and rewarding. Although it was very upsetting to hear evidence of young people who have been subjected to sexual exploitation in Scotland, I have been reassured that good work is being done up and down the country to help to protect vulnerable children.</p><p>It is clear from our investigation that more needs to be done to co-ordinate the actions of all the agencies that are involved: on data collection, preventative education, training for people in the care industry, the provision of therapeutic services for young people, and law enforcement. I therefore support the committee&#8217;s recommendation that the Scottish Government develop a national strategy for tackling child sexual exploitation. If that happens, I am positive that we can improve the services that we provide nationally, to ensure that every child, regardless of where they live in Scotland, has equal access to the support that they need if they are to avoid becoming a victim of child sexual exploitation, as well as the support that they would need to deal with the consequences of becoming a victim.</p><p>I again thank everyone who was involved in the committee&#8217;s inquiry, and I ask members to join me in commending the report to the Scottish Government.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-01-07", "body": "<p>I welcome to the Parliament today Debbie Duncan, a worker from the teen parent project in Kirkcaldy, Kathryn Miller of Fife Gingerbread, and Susanne Fraser-Kerr of Barnardo&#8217;s.</p><p>As many members may be aware, my constituency has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe. I am therefore keen to raise awareness of the issue and to highlight the excellent work that is done by Fife Gingerbread through initiatives such as the teen parent project, which provides support to young lone parents and helps them to cope with many of the problems that they face daily.</p><p>Evidence shows that young teenage mothers are less likely to complete their education or to seek further educational opportunities, and that teenage mothers are less likely to be employed and more likely to be in receipt of some form of income-based benefits or employed in low-paid jobs. Consequently, poverty is a major factor in teenage parenting. Indeed, data collected demonstrates that, statistically, there is a relationship between deprivation and teenage pregnancy; it indicates that young women under the age of 16 who live in Scotland&#8217;s most deprived areas are more likely to experience teenage pregnancy than those who live in the more affluent areas.</p><p>According to the 2012 Scottish index of multiple deprivation, the most educationally deprived data zone in Fife is to be found in the intermediate zone of Kirkcaldy and comprises the areas of Hayfield and Smeaton. It is ranked 27th, which places it among the top 5 per cent of the most educationally deprived areas in Scotland. According to the index, the most health-deprived zone in Fife is in the intermediate zone of Methil East. Both those zones lie in my constituency.</p><p>It is clear that, although other factors must be considered when looking at teenage pregnancies, deprivation plays a significant role and often brings with it low self-esteem. Fife Gingerbread is to be congratulated on its co-ordinated initiatives to address the issues that teenage mothers face.</p><p>Fife Gingerbread&#8217;s teen parent project provides one-to-one support to teenage parents in conjunction with group work and peer support. The project was originally developed in response to specific issues that face young parents in the Levenmouth area. Following the success of the initial pilot in Levenmouth, the project was launched in Kirkcaldy in partnership with the YMCA and with support from NHS Fife and other voluntary sector groups.</p><p>Operationally, a dedicated teen parent liaison worker works in partnership with health and education agencies and with wider voluntary and statutory partners. The aims are to support teenage parents in establishing good parenting skills and developing support networks and to promote engagement with other services.</p><p>Partnership working includes mellow babies, which runs in partnership with Barnardo&#8217;s; mellow bumps, which works in partnership with James and Harriet from Mellow Parenting; and a project that was introduced specifically for young fathers, in partnership with the Cottage Family Centre. The first mellow bumps programme started in October 2013 with referrals from the family health midwifery team, the family nurse partnership and health visitors. The Mellow Parenting programmes are in line with Scottish Government objectives.</p><p>Figures from the teen parent project&#8217;s progress report of February 2013 show that 264 young mothers have been supported in the Levenmouth and Kirkcaldy areas, that 52 young fathers have been supported and that 292 children have benefited. Many of the clients were also referred to one or more additional services, such as Barnardo&#8217;s, the Cottage Family Centre, Home-Start and the jobcentre.</p><p>Statistics that are based on an evaluation of the Kirkcaldy teen parent project that used the Rosenberg self-esteem scale evidenced an increase in the self-esteem of teen mothers. An evaluation of the Kirkcaldy and Levenmouth teen parent project that used the Warwick-Edinburgh mental wellbeing scale also evidenced an increase in the mental health and wellbeing of teen mothers. An evaluation of the Kirkcaldy teen parent project that used the tool to measure parenting self-efficacy evidenced an increase in the parenting skills and confidence of teen mothers. The excellent work that is carried out in the Kirkcaldy area was recognised in the UK&#8217;s biggest parenting competition, in which the Kirkcaldy teen parent project was named as one of the best in the east of Scotland.</p><p>The Linktown young parent group&#8212;which is based in an area of Kirkcaldy that I know well, having served as a councillor there for many years&#8212;was presented with a winner&#8217;s certificate and a gold listing at the Netmums awards. Local mums and dads praised Kirkcaldy teen parent project and called it the highlight of their week. Parents stated that what makes the group special to them is the caring staff, the great range of activities on offer for kids and the fact that it puts a smile on the face of everyone who attends.</p><p>I have been privileged to witness at first hand some of the work that is done by Fife Gingerbread and the teen parent project. I attended a Fife Gingerbread annual general meeting at which single parents highlighted the difficulties that they face daily. One speaker, who was nervous on that day, is now a project worker for Kirkcaldy teen parent project and is in the gallery this evening.</p><p>Recently, I was invited to Fife Gingerbread&#8217;s Hallowe&#8217;en party, where I was in my element in participating in the activities, including the singalong at the end, which I thoroughly enjoyed&#8212;although I am not sure that everyone else enjoyed my singing. Overall, parents and children alike had a fabulous time.</p><p>It was a delight to see how energetic and enthusiastic Debbie Duncan was in organising and participating in all that afternoon&#8217;s activities. Just before Christmas, when I was doing some last-minute shopping at Asda, I bumped into Debbie. She was shopping, but not for herself&#8212;she was looking for vegetables to enable her to make home-made soup for her group in the Linktown area, many of whom were going without in order to get presents for their children. She was ensuring that they would have something to eat on the day. That is just a small example of the commitment and dedication that she and Fife Gingerbread staff give to their projects and it shows their willingness to go the extra mile to provide the best possible services to parents and their children.</p><p>The teen parent project will aim to deliver programmes that provide specific support, while simultaneously raising awareness of issues such as welfare reform. The impact of recent welfare reforms has presented challenges to many vulnerable sectors of society, but none more so than single parents. Single parents now find themselves with even greater stress and worry as they are mandatorily transitioned from one benefit to another. They are getting increasingly more anxious and concerned about how reform will impact on their day-to-day living in providing for their children.</p><p>Fife Gingerbread is delivering an initiative entitled &#8220;Pimp my purse&#8221;; I love that title, which makes me smile every time I read it. The initiative involves holding workshops in partnership with Citizens Advice and Rights Fife and credit unions.</p><p>The Kirkcaldy project has recently been recognised for its achievements thus far and has received a substantial grant from the Big Lottery Fund&#8217;s young start initiative, which will enable Kirkcaldy teen parent project to continue to deliver highly valued services in the area.</p><p>Rhona and all her staff at Fife Gingerbread are delivering a service in my constituency that is greatly needed. It is tailored and delivered to the needs of teenage parents with an enthusiasm and passion that has had a positive and invaluable impact on all those taking part.</p><p>I wish Fife Gingerbread and its teen parent project every success in the future. I know that it will continue to make a huge difference in some of the most deprived areas of my constituency and I sincerely hope that those initiatives will be able to continue to support young teenage mums for many years to come.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Fife Gingerbread"}, {"date": "2013-11-27", "body": "<p>I thank James Dornan for bringing to the chamber the motion to congratulate St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid on its count me in campaign. As a lifelong scout, I know the importance of the phrase, &#8220;Be prepared.&#8221; That simple motto can serve as a life lesson for us all&#8212;to be prepared for good times, victories and triumphs, but also to be prepared for defeat, sickness and injury. In times of personal injury&#8212;of any sort&#8212;being prepared can mean the difference between life and death.</p><p>When a household accident occurs, many Scots&#8217; first instinct is to call 999, as it should be in the event of a true emergency. However, it is important to know the difference between what is and is not an emergency. Every year, 34,000 Scots are admitted to hospitals after falls, choking, burns and other common accidents. Although they can result in serious injuries, many such cases could have been sorted out or received initial care with basic first aid. Those 34,000 patients are being treated instead of the victims of more serious accidents or medical conditions.</p><p>Unfortunately, most Scots just do not know that many accidents are treatable at home, in part because only 23 per cent of Scots are trained in basic first aid procedures. If awareness is raised of the importance and value of first aid training, Scots can become more self-reliant and can take a serious burden off hospitals.</p><p>That is where St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid comes in. In the lead-up to first aid week, St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid has launched its count me in campaign, which, according to the organisation&#8217;s website,</p><p>&#8220;is aimed at building awareness that First Aid saves lives.&#8221;</p><p>The centrepiece of the campaign is:</p><p>&#8220;No one should die because they needed First Aid and didn&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p><p>In its pursuit of that goal, St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid is seeking 34,000 signatures&#8212;one for each of the Scots who are admitted to hospital each year for common injuries that require emergency attention, but who could have initially received first aid assistance. Furthermore, the campaign seeks to educate the 77 per cent of Scots who are not trained in basic first aid procedures on how crucial it is to learn such skills.</p><p>As the leading provider of work-related first aid training in Scotland, St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid provides a wide variety of services that relate to first aid accreditation. It has a series of downloadable materials for small business owners, hospitality managers, employees and other members of any business to help guide people towards enrolment in first aid training.</p><p>St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid is particularly concerned with the Scottish hospitality industry, in which last year more than 500 workers received an injury that kept them off work for at least three days. In restaurants alone, 205 cooking and serving-related accidents were recorded last year. One in 10 Scots say that they have witnessed a medical emergency in a hotel, restaurant or other entertainment venue, and one in 16 have needed medical assistance for injuries that they themselves have sustained. St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid seeks to create a more resilient Scotland&#8212;one in which hospitality workers and people in their homes do not have to fear for their safety in the event of an accident and do not unnecessarily burden the emergency medical services.</p><p>I know first hand the importance of first aid training. As a scout leader and a lifelong scout, I teach my scouts to be prepared for anything. I have been first aid certified since I was 18 years old, and I often help young scouts to acquire their first aid badges. When we go on camping trips in the summer, it is important to have someone who can respond to such unfortunate situations. I am proud to be one of the few who can, but I wish that it were not such an exclusive group.</p><p>I urge Scots everywhere to get first aid certified. As someone who has experienced the positive benefits of first aid training up close in various situations in which I have had to take action to help my family and friends, I can assure members that it is worth the time that it takes to do. I congratulate St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid on its efforts in its everyday work and its count me in campaign, and I hope that the organisation knows that I am a huge supporter of its work.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;First Aid?

I was only two years old when President Kennedy was assassinated. I do not remember the feeling in the air after it happened. I do not remember the powerful reaction of the whole world to that earth-shattering moment. I do not even remember how upset my parents and other family must have felt afterwards.</p><p>However, we do not have to be able to remember that day to understand the profound impact that President Kennedy had on our world. JFK&#8217;s numerous achievements on the domestic and international stages created an image of a man who deserves our utmost respect. One can only imagine how different our world would be if his life had not been cruelly cut short.</p><p>JFK had a vision for peace and prosperity the world over. He loved his country and cared deeply and passionately about civil rights, economic prosperity and scientific innovation through space exploration. However, given the nature of the times, much of his focus was on world politics and, in particular, on relations with the Soviet Union.</p><p>A reminder of JFK&#8217;s humanity is that his presidency experienced many highs and many lows. One of his lows was the failed Bay of Pigs invasion near the beginning of his presidency in 1961. The attack had been largely planned before he took office, so he was briefed after being elected and he approved the plan without having much time to think about it before the invasion was launched. From that experience, Kennedy learned that he would have to develop a better strategy for US and Soviet relations than rushing into armed conflict.</p><p>The desire to avoid superpower skirmishes helped JFK to bring the world back from the brink of nuclear war in 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis. He had been involved in that conflict from the beginning. He was able to remain calm, even while the world was preparing to duck and cover and when an American plane was shot down, killing the pilot. The achievement of a resolution through direct negotiation with the USSR reinforced his view that reconciliation was achievable.</p><p>Kennedy&#8217;s new views were on display in his commencement address on 10 June 1963 at the American University in Washington DC, which was also 50 years ago this year. He said:</p><p>&#8220;I have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived. And that is the most important topic on earth: peace ... not merely peace in our time, but peace in all time.&#8221;</p><p>He went on to announce his willingness to negotiate with the Soviets</p><p>&#8220;toward early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty&#8221;,</p><p>which resulted in the nuclear test ban treaty later that year. He also declared that he would not conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere as long as other states refrained from testing there as well. As he said, that was an attempt</p><p>&#8220;to make clear our good faith and solemn convictions on this matter.&#8221;</p><p>That speech signalled the climax of a dramatic growth in President Kennedy&#8217;s character over his short, incomplete presidency, and it showed his aspirations for world peace, which we could all stand to take some time to refocus on.</p><p>I would like to take a moment to share with members an excerpt from one of President Kennedy&#8217;s final speeches. On 13 November 1963&#8212;only days before he was assassinated&#8212;the Scottish Black Watch band performed for him and more than 1,000 guests on the White House south lawn during its American tour. JFK shared with the gathered crowd these words on the importance of American and Scottish connections. He said:</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re proud to have them here because they are a Scottish regiment, and that green and misty country has sent hundreds of thousands of Scottish men and women to the United States, and they have been among our finest citizens. And we&#8217;re proud to have them here, because, speaking personally, the history of Scotland captured me at a very young age. The United States, and in fact all of us, love, I suppose, lost causes, and on occasion the history of Scotland has been a lost cause, but in some ways they have triumphed&#8212;perhaps more today than ever before.&#8221;</p><p>It is no surprise to me that Richard Lyle felt compelled to lodge this motion on the 50th anniversary of JFK&#8217;s assassination, and I thank him again for it. President Kennedy felt a deep connection to our great country, just as many of us felt a deep connection to him and his unparalleled leadership. Let us take this anniversary of his death to reflect on the many leadership lessons that we can learn from him and to renew our faith in our cause and our country, as he would have us do.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: John F Kennedy Assassination (50th Anniversary)"}, {"date": "2013-11-14", "body": "<p>I thank Colin Keir for bringing to the chamber the motion to celebrate 100 years of conservation, research and education at Edinburgh zoo. Edinburgh zoo has much to be proud of and its centenary is only one of its many accomplishments. I am proud to rise today in support of the motion to honour 100 years of conservation, research and education at the zoo because of how important its work is to conservation efforts in Scotland and around the world.</p><p>When the zoo was opened in 1913 by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland&#8217;s founder, Thomas Gillespie, the RZSS was only four years old, but the zoo&#8217;s reputation and prestige grew over time to make it a prime tourist destination for Edinburgh and Scotland.</p><p>In addition to being the only zoological park in the United Kingdom to have a royal charter, Edinburgh zoo prides itself on its size, popularity and leadership in the conservation community. Furthermore, the RZSS uses the zoo&#8217;s centre of conservation for threatened domestic and international species as a platform for its various wildlife protection programmes.</p><p>One of those programmes is the Pantanal conservation and research initiative, which focuses on preserving the Pantanal wetlands, the world&#8217;s largest freshwater wetlands, which are located in Brazil and parts of Bolivia. The zoo attaches importance to that project due to the rich biodiversity that is threatened by development programmes and changes in land management practices. However, the lessons learnt in conservation practices from the Pantanal wetlands are not isolated to that ecosystem&#8212;in fact, they are principles of wildlife preservation internationally.</p><p>Of course, the most popular venture by the RZSS is the China-UK giant panda project&#8212;a partnership with the Wolong panda breeding centre in Sichuan province, China, with the goal of reintroducing pandas into the wild. In the collective efforts to preserve, protect and rebuild panda habitats in the area, the RZSS remains active in Sichuan province following the 8.0 magnitude earthquake that hit the area in 2008. In return, China has loaned two giant pandas to the UK&#8212;one of only three pairs in all of Europe&#8212;which the RZSS can study and research, all with the goal of protecting this wildly endangered species. The project is particularly popular among the 600,000 annual visitors to Edinburgh zoo who flock to see the increasingly rare giant pandas.</p><p>Although the RZSS focuses its conservation efforts abroad, it is also concerned with wildlife preservation here in Scotland. One significant project is the Cairngorms wildcat project, which runs in partnership with the RZSS and several other Scottish organisations and seeks to protect and preserve the Scottish wildcat. The Scottish wildcat, which is often called the Highland tiger, is an endangered species for a variety of reasons. Interactions with domestic and feral cats have been devastating to the Scottish wildcat. Activities that are occurring as part of the project include increasing the number of vaccinations and neuterings that are being performed in areas surrounding the Cairngorms national park and working with land managers to ensure that predator control is wildcat friendly.</p><p>The RZSS&#8217;s Scottish beaver trial programme is another conservation effort that is being housed at Edinburgh zoo. The project&#8217;s aim is to decide whether beavers should be reintroduced into Scotland since being hunted to extinction in the 16th century. Beavers are a keystone species, which means that their presence is an indicator of other kinds of life in their environment. Because of their feeding and damming practices, they are able to create ponds and wetlands that attract other species, develop biodiversity and even improve water quality. However, reintroducing beavers without properly monitoring the process could also be harmful to the environment, so it is important to study the issue carefully.</p><p>In order to be closer to wildcats, beavers and many other species of animal that roam the Scottish Highlands, the RZSS opened the Highland wildlife park at Kingussie, right in the middle of the Cairngorm national park. The Highland wildlife park serves as a tourist destination for Highland visitors and an educational institution for schoolchildren of all ages. Lessons range from tours for pre-schoolers to research days and full-on lectures for secondary school pupils and older.</p><p>Through various hands-on workshops, such as its touch-and-feel session with the skins and skulls of animals, the park works with students who have assisted learning needs. The Highland wildlife park&#8217;s emphasis on education is a testament to the mission of the RZSS, which is:</p><p>&#8220;To inspire and excite our visitors with the wonder of living animals, and so to promote the conservation of threatened species and habitats.&#8221;</p><p>Edinburgh zoo and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland have a lot to be proud of. From research and education initiatives to active engagement in worldwide conservation efforts, it is impossible not to see the RZSS&#8217;s impact in the past century. Happy birthday to Edinburgh zoo and here&#8217;s to the next 100 years.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Edinburgh Zoo"}, {"date": "2013-11-07", "body": "<p>I thank Mike MacKenzie for bringing the debate to the chamber. I am proud to join my colleagues today in congratulating the 12 winners of the 2013 Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland awards. All the winning buildings are testament to Scottish ability and raw creative talent, in addition to the skills of the various international partners involved. I wish everyone who is involved the best of luck in tonight&#8217;s awards ceremony and congratulate them on their accomplishments.</p><p>Following the announcement of those awards, I was especially proud of my fellow Fifers when I saw that the new Dunfermline high school was recognised as an award winner not only by RIAS, but by Zero Waste Scotland in the special category for resource efficiency. After the years of hard work and planning that have gone into the construction of the new Dunfermline high school building, Fife Council property and education services and everyone involved from the school and elsewhere should be proud of their collective accomplishment.</p><p>Opened in August 2012, the school is the flagship project of Fife Council&#8217;s building Fife&#8217;s future programme, which has invested &#163;126 million in new schools around Fife. That investment has included a new secondary school for Kirkcaldy and the provision of &#163;40 million for Dunfermline high school. The programme is designed to build state-of-the-art schools that are highly adaptable, functional and sustainable places of learning fit for the 21st century and beyond.</p><p>Sustainable design was a key part of the plan for Dunfermline high school and accounts for its selection for the Zero Waste Scotland award. The building Fife&#8217;s future programme set targets for the school from the outset and ultimately managed to achieve a Building Research Establishment environmental assessment method &#8220;excellent&#8221; rating and an energy performance certificate rating of A for the building. That was done through passive design measures in ventilation and natural lighting, as well as advanced recycling and renewable energy systems, such as rainwater collection and the installation of solar panels.</p><p>The initial construction process focused on resource efficiency, and subcontractors were encouraged to come up with innovative waste reduction ideas. For example, 100 per cent of excavated soil was reused, saving &#163;60,000 and minimising the environmental impact of transporting the soil to landfill and leaving it there. Further, 94 per cent of subcontractors were based within 50 miles of the school, meaning that Fife businesses were supported and less carbon was spent by transportation. More important, the building is a testament to what architecture should be all about&#8212;a building should be for the people who use it every day.</p><p>The beauty of the building is that it achieves those things, while being exactly what the school needs. School administrators, teachers and pupils were all involved in the design process from the beginning. That can be seen in the widespread use of natural lighting, flexible learning areas and open spaces in the building, all of which were pupil requests. The open spaces and excellent overall visibility in the building also contribute to the see and be seen approach to building design, promoted by school administrators, which is proven to cut down on bullying by creating fewer corners for bullies to lurk in.</p><p>As an educational institution, the new Dunfermline high school is top of the line. It is designed to accommodate 1,800 pupils. The building is equipped with a large assembly hall with tiered seating, a modern library complete with resources centre, approximately 1,200 computers or laptops and full wireless technology. The new school&#8217;s infrastructure is designed to support student life inside and outside the classroom, as the school includes a drama studio with rehearsal rooms, a dance studio, a sports hall, a fitness suite, two gymnasiums and extensive playing fields, including a large Astroturf pitch. Finally, the cafeteria, coffee bar and colourful, glazed three-storey wall all help to create relaxing communal areas, which make the school feel more alive than institutional.</p><p>Since 1468, Dunfermline high school has been an educational hub for Dunfermline and Fife. In August 2012, the school began a new chapter of educational excellence. Thanks to the excellent investment strategy of Fife Council through the building Fife&#8217;s future programme and the outstanding abilities of BAM Construction, the young people of Dunfermline have been blessed with a remarkable school for generations to come.</p><p>It is for those and many other reasons that Dunfermline high school has most deservingly won a RIAS award and a Zero Waste Scotland award in the special category for resource efficiency. All 12 RIAS award winners have similar stories of improving the lives of everyday Scots, for example through investment in community centres, schools and theatres throughout Scotland.</p><p>I commend RIAS for recognising those accomplishments and look forward to finding out who the winner of the Andrew Doolan best building in Scotland award will be tonight.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Best Buildings in Scotland"}, {"date": "2013-11-06", "body": "<p></p><p>6.

I am proud to join my colleagues in congratulating the University of Edinburgh on climbing to number 17 in the QS World University Rankings. That is a fantastic achievement for the university and it goes some way towards recognising the exceptional quality of its teaching and research activities. It also highlights Scotland&#8217;s well-deserved place in the world as a leading centre for education.</p><p>The University of Edinburgh is one of Scotland&#8217;s ancient educational institutions. Founded in 1583 following the granting of a royal charter by James VI, it has provided Scotland with more than 400 years of exemplary standards in education.</p><p>In the early 18th century, during the age of enlightenment, the city of Edinburgh became known as a major intellectual centre, thanks to its outstanding university, which of course was central in Scotland&#8217;s enlightenment.</p><p>Over the years, many esteemed scholars and academics have walked through the university&#8217;s doors. Its impressive collection of alumni includes a plethora of famous names, such as Charles Darwin, David Hume, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Alexander Graham Bell and Sir Walter Scott&#8212;to name but a few.</p><p>Today the university is home to an impressive array of leading international researchers, who provide a first-class standard of teaching to their many students. The school of medicine is particularly renowned and was ranked first in the United Kingdom in the most recent research assessment exercise results. The university has also been praised for its excellence in veterinary medicine, linguistics, art, chemistry and mathematics.</p><p>The university is at the forefront of research and development in, for example, the life sciences and renewable energy. Support for universities is therefore key to Scotland&#8217;s future. That is why the Scottish Government invests more than &#163;1 billion a year in higher education and has allocated an additional &#163;13.8 million directly to fund research at our universities. By investing in our world-leading facilities, we are building the foundations of a better and more secure Scotland for years to come.</p><p>The University of Edinburgh plays a major role in that regard and it is essential that we provide the necessary support to ensure that it continues to do so. Its ranking as one of the world&#8217;s top 20 universities will not only enhance Scotland&#8217;s status on the international stage but help the university to attract more of the most talented and ambitious students from all over the globe.</p><p>Edinburgh receives a high volume of international applicants, but I am proud that more than 40 per cent of the undergraduates that it welcomes come from Scotland and that a further 29 per cent come from the rest of the UK. It is significant that 74 per cent of undergraduates come from state schools and colleges, which provides some assurance that the university, despite its prestige and international standing, remains accessible to local students from all backgrounds.</p><p>The University of Edinburgh provides jobs and prospects to thousands of citizens and plays an important role in fuelling our economy. Through its research and innovation programme, it promotes entrepreneurship and supports the creation of new businesses. In 2012-13 the university helped to create 35 new companies&#8212;it has consistently created new companies over the past four years. That is a major contribution to the Scottish economy, and I am grateful to the university for continuing to devote resources to such an important part of its work.</p><p>It is clear that the university offers Scotland a great deal. I cannot thank and praise its staff and students enough for their efforts in helping their university to achieve such a prestigious accolade in the QS World University Rankings. I am an incredibly proud Scot and I think that we can take much pride in our country, including in our reputation for quality education and research&#8212;thanks, in no small part, to the University of Edinburgh.

Some 70 workers have been directly affected by immediate redundancy announcements. Our thoughts are with those individuals and their families as they go through this period of significant uncertainty. The Scottish Government&#8217;s immediate response to the news was to ensure that we are doing all that we can to support the workers who have been affected by the announcement.</p><p>Following the announcement on Friday, we immediately offered individual tailored support to each of those employees through our partnership action for continuing employment initiative, and we will work with KPMG, as the administrator, and with the trade unions to ensure that we deliver the best, most practical and most personal support that we can deliver.</p><p>We have also established a task force, with the aims of retaining a functioning shipyard and employing as many of the Ferguson staff as possible.</p><p>I chaired the first meeting of the task force yesterday. In attendance were the Minister for Transport and Veterans; representatives from Inverclyde Council, including the leader of the council and its chief executive; the administrator, which is KPMG; PACE; the Department for Work and Pensions; Scottish Enterprise; the Scottish Government; the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions; local shop stewards from Ferguson&#8217;s shipyard; and local members of the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>We discussed the immediate and practical assistance that could be made available for those who are facing redundancy, as well as the potential for maximising the opportunities for long-term employment in shipbuilding on the lower Clyde. However, the task force has unanimously agreed that there will be a concerted and coherent effort to do everything in our collective and combined powers to secure a new owner for the yard: we are determined to see shipbuilding continue on the lower Clyde.</p><p>We will continue to work together to ensure that we see the best possible outcome for Port Glasgow. The next meeting of the task force will be on Monday coming, and we will continue to meet for as long as it takes to achieve the aims of the task force.</p><p>Members are well aware of the long and proud heritage of shipbuilding on the River Clyde. For Ferguson&#8217;s specifically, that heritage dates back some 103 years, to when four brothers established the yard. At one point, the yard employed up to 200 people. More recently, following a difficult period in the early 2000s, we have witnessed the yard look to the future with the cutting-edge delivery of the world&#8217;s first sea-going roll-on, roll-off diesel-electric hybrid ferries.</p><p>Since 2007, any contract that Ferguson&#8217;s has had the capability and capacity to bid for, it has been successful in winning. Specifically, we awarded to Ferguson&#8217;s the contract for two hybrid ferries in October 2011, procured by Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd and funded by Transport Scotland. Those contracts have provided more than &#163;20&#160;million of work for Ferguson&#8217;s, which has accounted for a substantial part of the yard&#8217;s recent work.</p><p>The Scottish Government, through the vessel owners CMAL, worked very closely with the owners and management of Ferguson Shipbuilders to ensure delivery of those vessels. At the time of that award, it was understood that the work would enable the company to remain competitive and, it was hoped, would give it a unique capability and foundation for further orders. That has proved not to be the case.</p><p>Since January 2014, Ferguson&#8217;s has been working with CMAL, Transport Scotland and Scottish Enterprise to review its financial position. With the support of CMAL, the final payment on the second hybrid ferry to Ferguson&#8217;s was split into staged payments in order to ease cash-flow pressures.</p><p>Scottish Enterprise at that stage provided grant support for a financial health check to establish the business&#8217;s financial position and short-term funding requirements. That was followed up in February 2014 with financial readiness support to review the business strategically and to prepare it for investment, which was again provided by Scottish Enterprise. In March 2014, further grant support was delivered to provide information that would help Ferguson&#8217;s to consider the medium-term needs of the business, including new investment or ownership to reshape the business.</p><p>There continues to be work at Ferguson&#8217;s&#8212;partly funded by &#163;2&#160;million from the Scottish Government and the European fisheries fund&#8212;that needs to be finished. That work will be important to any new owner in the early days of a takeover, and it is obviously important to the customer that they take delivery of a vessel in which they have already invested a great amount for completion. We will do whatever we can within the rules to pay grant claims to the vessel owner very quickly, once work recommences.</p><p>I firmly believe that there is a viable future for shipbuilding on the lower Clyde. Our aspiration for future ferry orders remains, and I have allocated significant capital funds to Transport Scotland to deliver that. The Scottish ferries plan sets out a series of vessel procurements over the next decade; 12 current CalMac Ferries vessels are to be replaced at an estimated cost of up to &#163;250&#160;million. Half those vessels are of similar size to the two hybrid ferries that Ferguson recently built. CalMac, CMAL and Transport Scotland are currently completing long-term plans for that procurement programme. There will certainly be construction work for a new owner of Ferguson to compete for, as well as regular repair and maintenance work from CalMac.</p><p>Through CalMac and CMAL, the Scottish Government is investing significant sums in the design, construction and maintenance of vessels. There is sufficient work to sustain Ferguson under a new owner that has the vision and commitment to invest in the shipyard and its workforce. We would work closely with any new owner to support it in building a sustainable business, although we recognise that that cannot happen overnight.</p><p>I must return to the most important aspect of recent events; 70 livelihoods are directly at stake. In Port Glasgow, we have a highly skilled workforce, and it is essential that those skills be put to productive use. That commitment must be delivered with real urgency.</p><p>The administrator has made it clear that Friday&#8217;s announcement has generated significant interest in Ferguson&#8217;s assets and capabilities. There is a challenge for all of us to work together to secure the shipyard&#8217;s long-term future. Our goal continues to be to secure the long-term future of Scotland&#8217;s vital shipbuilding industry; the Government will do all that it can to work with others to secure the future of shipbuilding on the lower Clyde.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Ferguson Shipbuilders"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>I welcome the substance of Iain Gray&#8217;s remarks and agree entirely that the jobs at Ferguson represent jobs of the future, especially given its innovation in recent years in building the hybrid vessels. Those vessels contribute significantly, of course, not only in terms of new technology, but in addressing carbon reduction issues that all Administrations around the world will have to address. Ferguson is in a leading position in being able to influence that consideration by a variety of countries.</p><p>On the prospects of future orders, I set out in my statement the extent of the investment in the ferry fleet in the next few years, which has an estimated cost of up to &#163;250&#160;million across 12 CalMac vessels.</p><p>About half those vessels equate in size to the hybrid vessels that Ferguson&#8217;s has just completed. As I said, Ferguson&#8217;s has a strong track record of successfully securing the orders for which it is equipped to bid, given the yard&#8217;s size and focus.</p><p>I assure Parliament that the Government is putting in place the resources to ensure that there is an on-going and sustained investment programme in the CalMac fleet, and that the Government will commit to making orders available for the fleet&#8217;s renewal at the appropriate times, given its commitments to operating lifeline ferry services and to ensuring that the services are provided by vessels that are of a quality and strength that are appropriate to the task.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Ferguson Shipbuilders"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>This morning, I spoke to the Secretary of State for Scotland. He made it clear that if there is anything that the United Kingdom Government could do, it would do so. He relayed the view that all steps that could be taken at this stage are being taken.</p><p>On new investors, the Scottish Government will talk to any serious bidder in the process. The primary responsibility for that dialogue lies with the administrator, given its statutory functions. However, I take the opportunity that is presented by Ms Goldie&#8217;s question to make the point that we believe that the way forward is through new ownership and investment. Over the next few days, those are the supremely urgent priorities, because without securing them, the danger is that the workforce&#8212;what I consider to be Ferguson&#8217;s crucial asset&#8212;will start to dissipate as individuals, quite understandably, in order to try to secure alternative opportunities to support their families. I assure Parliament that the identification of new owners is the Government&#8217;s absolute and immediate priority. This morning, I discussed those issues with the administrators.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Ferguson Shipbuilders"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>As I indicated, the Government, through the work of Transport Scotland, CMAL and Scottish Enterprise, has been heavily involved in supporting development at Ferguson&#8217;s yard. The hybrid ferry contract is a significant example of diversification, with the deployment of an entirely new technology and its application in a challenging environment. Last week, I was on the MV Lochinvar and I can testify to the beauty of Ferguson&#8217;s work&#8212;it is absolutely fantastic.</p><p>There is evidence of diversification. The hybrid ferry contract represents an opportunity to market an innovation from Scotland to jurisdictions around the world. That is a significant and attractive opportunity for any new buyer to invest in the yard.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Ferguson Shipbuilders"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>I would like to make three points to Mr McNeil.</p><p>Obviously, I understand the raw sensitivity on this issue in the Port Glasgow community. I addressed that on my visit to the yard yesterday and in my discussions with the workforce and subsequently with the shop stewards. I am sure that that point was also discussed when the First Minister met the shop stewards earlier today.</p><p>The Government and its agencies have been involved in trying to address what I described at the task force yesterday as the precarious financial position of Ferguson&#8217;s for some time. That is what the Government does for companies all the time, and we invariably do not disclose to Parliament or to anybody that we are having those discussions because to disclose them would be to destabilise many of the companies that we are trying to support by addressing their problems. That is therefore not something that I am going to apologise to Parliament for.</p><p>I think that Parliament would be horrified if the Government was not involved in private discussions with companies to try to remedy their precarious financial situation. That is what Government&#8212;certainly this Government&#8212;is here to do. How employers then deal with that with employees is another matter.</p><p>That is the second point that Mr McNeil raised that I want to address. In my experience of situations in which we are involved in discussions with companies about their precarious financial position, the situation is much improved when the workforce are taken into the loop because that is where many of the good solutions come from. I can think of numerous examples that have never hit the headlines where hundreds of jobs have been saved. They have never been in a newspaper in the country because of the private discussions involving trade unions, the workforce, the management and the Government to resolve the issues. It would be better if that type of discussion was going on. Frankly, the key point that emerged from the review that Mr Mather undertook yesterday is that workforce and management discussions are a tremendous asset in resolving challenges within companies.</p><p>My final point is on the issue of the future role of the Ferguson shipyard. I was crystal clear yesterday and I am crystal clear today that my priority is to secure a future for Ferguson&#8217;s as a shipbuilding concern in the years to come. That is the focus of our discussions. We do not have control over that issue, because an administrator is now in control of the site, but the Government&#8217;s intervention and approach will be to secure the future for Ferguson&#8217;s as a shipbuilding concern in the years to come.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Ferguson Shipbuilders"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>What I can say to Mr Gibson is that there is an on-going programme in the ferries plan that sets out the routes that will require replacement vessels.

Of course, we are shortly to take delivery of the MV Loch Seaforth for the Stornoway to Ullapool route, and further contracts will follow in the wake of the Loch Seaforth.

I am encouraged by the impressive level of cross-party support that he obtained for the motion, although that was also the case when the Parliament debated bees previously. As members may know, my colleagues Paul Wheelhouse and Richard Lochhead are currently at different ends of the country making important announcements, so they turned to a former environment minister to step into the breach.</p><p>I was toying with some justice-related bee puns, but the only thing that I could come up with was to say that the police have been training crack bee squads in order to help with their sting operations&#8212;I do not know where that fits with members&#8217; puns on the issue. I responded to the motion when we debated the issue in 2009. The discussion then was as informed as it has been today. I have been flicking through the Official Report of that debate, and I see that there were also an equal number of puns&#8212;it is unavoidable.</p><p>Members will forgive me if, this time, I have to refer some of their more specific questions to my colleagues. I know that they will come back on some issues. During that debate, I highlighted the Scottish Government&#8217;s intention to launch a 10-year honey bee health strategy. That strategy has enhanced partnership working. We are halfway through the period, and the strategy is helping us to make steady progress towards the common goal of creating a sustainable and healthy population of honey bees in Scotland. I am encouraged by the strengthening of bee health initiatives and the improved biosecurity in response to that honey bee health strategy. It is nonetheless important for beekeepers to appreciate the significant role that they play in disease management and control within their apiaries.</p><p>The economic importance of the honey market in Scotland is self-evident, as it has an average annual value of around &#163;9 million. Initiatives such as the Bee Farmers Association&#8217;s apprenticeship scheme help to strengthen this important industry by supporting young people to take up the enterprise.</p><p>The Bee Keeping (Colonsay and Oronsay) Order 2013 is an important step to ensuring that we have a reserve of black bee colonies that are free from disease and hybridisation threats. I am sure that, had Peter Peacock been in the chamber, he would have welcomed that, too.</p><p>As we have heard from a number of members, including Angus MacDonald and Alison Johnstone, the issue is not just about honey bees. In the UK, there are at least 1,500 species of insects that pollinate plants. I will have to ask Jayne Baxter to forgive me, because I do not have specific lines on bats. I am indebted to her for bringing to my attention the fact that bats, too, play a role in this area, and I will reprimand my officials for not at least including some reference to them in my briefing. There is increasing evidence that wild bees and hoverflies are particularly important pollinators in Scotland, and the value of insect pollination services in Scotland&#8212;which, as Jayne Baxter said, is estimated to be &#163;43 million per year&#8212;was acknowledged in the &#8220;2020 Challenge for Scotland&#8217;s Biodiversity&#8221;.</p><p>We share members&#8217; concerns about the declines in the number, diversity and geographical range of pollinators, especially those with more specialised habitat or forage needs, and we recognise that we need to improve our understanding of the distribution and abundance of, and changes in, pollinators in the countryside. That is why we are contributing to a new UK-level initiative to design and test a national pollinator and pollination monitoring scheme. The future monitoring effort will include an important people engagement element, which will build on the contributions that can be made through citizen science.</p><p>The Scottish Government continues to support initiatives that improve our understanding of the range of factors that affect pollinators. For example&#8212;this partly answers Claudia Beamish&#8217;s request for information about research&#8212;we are investing &#163;560,000 in the insect pollinators initiative, which is a major research initiative that will involve investment of a total of &#163;10 million in nine projects over five years. It is being led by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, and it draws together a number of partners. The initiative includes studies on managing bee and other insect pollinator diseases, understanding the impact of land use changes on pollinators, understanding the ecology and conservation of urban bees, and pollinator efficiency.</p><p>As I would have expected, a number of members have mentioned the problem of neonicotinoids or neonics. The Scottish Government will scrutinise the emerging research evidence on the effects of neonic use, and it continues to support advisory work by Scotland&#8217;s Rural College that informs farmers on the safe use of pesticide products and alternatives to pesticides.</p><p>Our activity is, of course, much broader than simply evidence gathering. There is much that we already know, and there is a lot that we can do, and indeed are doing, to help pollinators in Scotland. That includes maintaining and re-establishing wildflower-rich grasslands and pasture. In the next Scotland rural development programme, pollinators will continue to be one of the beneficiaries in the arable options. That might not answer the highly specific question that Liam McArthur asked, but I will ask my colleagues to get back to him with any further information.</p><p>Appropriate management of our hedgerows and road edges by local authorities and land managers is also important, as it ensures that the wild flowers along them are allowed to flourish during the main flowering period between March and September. In the green spaces in urban areas, many of us can make a contribution by planting pollinator-friendly plants in our gardens. It is important that those plants span the seasons, from the early-flowering bluebells to summer thyme to the late-flowering honeysuckle, lavender and sunflower plants. I reiterate a point that I made in the 2009 debate: allowing some wild areas in urban gardens is an enormous help. It is also an excuse to be a lazy gardener, and I do not think that people need excuses for that.</p><p>We need to build on successful initiatives such as the Bumblebee Conservation Trust&#8217;s bees for everyone project, which is supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Scottish Natural Heritage. We recognise the range of activity that is required to enhance and improve pollinator populations, and we are working with SNH to produce towards the end of the year a pollinator strategy that will help to consolidate the partnership and collaboration effort that is already in place. The principles of the Buglife manifesto will be taken forward through that strategy, and it will frame future surveillance and monitoring needs, as well as the crucial research that is required to help improve our understanding of the complexities of the issue. A contribution of &#163;100,000 has been made to the scheme&#8212;that is another aspect of the spend.</p><p>I thank members for their speeches on the importance of Scotland&#8217;s pollinators. Raising awareness of the issues and the steps that we can all take to help pollinators is important, and I hope that it is not another five years before there is another debate on bees in the Parliament.</p><p>13:19 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:30 On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Pollinator Population"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>The Scottish Government is committed to tackling antisocial behaviour.

In Isis-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq, as many as 30,000 people have fled the area around Mosul following the recently published ultimatum to northern Iraq&#8217;s dwindling Christian population effectively to either convert to Islam or die. It is estimated that only a few hundred Christian families now remain in Mosul but, as Kenny Gibson said, that may now in fact be none. Of course, it is not only Christians who are under threat in Iraq. Reports yesterday highlighted the plight of the Yazidi community&#8212;a community of believers who combine Zoroastrianism with some early aspects of Islam and Christian belief&#8212;who are being forced into the mountains surrounding Sinjar following an Islamic State offensive on the city last Sunday. Reports today suggest that those people are now dying of thirst. If they go back down the mountain, they die; if they stay, they die. They, too, are under the most appalling persecution and we should not forget them when we are talking about the persecution of Christians.</p><p>This has been a catastrophe long in the making.

The &#8220;Forgotten&#8221; part of that is also important. Canon Andrew White, who has already been mentioned by a number of speakers, is the vicar of Baghdad. He has witnessed the extreme suffering of Christians in recent weeks and has accused the British Government of doing nothing to help fleeing Christians. Church of England bishops, along with other church leaders, have called upon the Government to offer asylum to Iraqi Christians. The Bishop of Manchester pointed out the sobering truth that</p><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happening now in Iraq is the direct consequence of what happened in 2003 ... this is, in part, our mess.&#8221;</p><p>I am not sure that anybody could really disagree with that.</p><p>The Archbishop of Canterbury has joined a worldwide social media campaign by adopting the image of the Arabic letter N&#8212;the first letter of the Arabic word &#8220;Nasrani&#8221;, which of course means Nazarene or Christian&#8212;in solidarity with persecuted Christians suffering in Iraq. People may begin to see that particular image appearing more frequently.</p><p>I call on the global media not to ignore what is happening to those minority communities. Patricia Ferguson is right when she says that much of this persecution has gone largely unreported. Had it not been for social media, much of what we know would have gone unknown. The sheer numbers of those likely to die over the next year&#8212;Murdo Fraser quoted the figure of 100,000&#8212;should surely mean that the subject goes to the top of the news agenda instead of being at best buried and at worst totally ignored. That is a media failure and is simply not good enough. I fear that maybe Christians are simply not fashionable enough.</p><p>It is, however, important to acknowledge that many Muslims are just as concerned about attacks on Christians as we might be. Last month, more than 200 people, including Muslims, gathered in front of a Catholic church in Baghdad to show solidarity with their Christian neighbours by carrying &#8220;I am Iraqi, I am Christian&#8221; slogans. Given that a prominent Muslim academic has already been assassinated for speaking out in solidarity with Christians, acts of solidarity are also acts of incredible bravery, and we need to recognise that when we see it.</p><p>Members have raised the issue of the Scottish Government&#8217;s broad and general approach, and I take the opportunity to restate that. Of course, we in Scotland believe in equality for all people whatever they believe, and as good global citizens we have a strong and enduring commitment to securing democracy, the rule of law and fundamental human rights around the world.</p><p>Everyone knows that foreign affairs are reserved, but that does not let us off the hook when it comes to expressing our views and bringing to bear what pressure we can as individuals, in our communities or indeed as a Government. During the Commonwealth games, we took every opportunity to engage with Commonwealth countries in a diplomatically and culturally sensitive fashion to make clear Scotland&#8217;s view on equality and human rights.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Persecuted Christians"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>Yes.

The Minister for External Affairs and International Development has regularly spoken out against the persecution of religious minorities wherever it takes place. Only last month he wrote to the Home Secretary about Gaza, urging the UK Government to play a full role in any international efforts to provide homes for refugees from that region and stating that Scotland is ready to play its part. We have also donated &#163;200,000 to the Disasters Emergency Committee in Scotland&#8217;s Syria crisis appeal in response to the suffering in Syria and we are providing &#163;500,000 of funding to help the United Nations to provide water, food, shelter and medical assistance to the people of Gaza.</p><p>We recognise the influence for good that religious belief can have on the lives of individuals, families and the wider community, which is why we actively promote and support interfaith relations as a means of developing trust, respect and social harmony between communities at local and national levels.</p><p>In closing, I congratulate all the churches and other faith communities and organisations, such as Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Aid to the Church in Need, the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, Remembering Srebrenica, Open Doors UK and Islamic Relief UK as well as all their supporters, who work tirelessly towards supporting the victims of intolerance and hatred and removing religious intolerance wherever it is found.

The reforms are intended to make the administration of justice in Scotland more efficient and more accessible to ordinary people at a proportionate cost.</p><p>The fundamental principle of the bill is that the right cases will be heard in the right courts. Currently, the choice of court is almost invariably made not by the litigant but by his or her legal adviser. Some cases are routinely taken to the Court of Session, needlessly increasing the legal costs to litigants. The proposed changes will, therefore, bring benefits to litigants.</p><p>On delivering reduced costs for litigants, Labour made it plain, when it commissioned the Scottish civil courts review in 2007, that one of the four key issues to be reviewed was the cost of litigation to the parties. The raising of the exclusive competence of the sheriff court is essential if we are to deliver better access to justice. I am glad that the committee acknowledged that, although I accept that there is a variance of opinion on what the level should be.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has already discussed the position on sanction for counsel in asbestos cases and other complex personal injury cases. It will be possible to remit complex personal injury cases from the sheriff court to the Court of Session. Sanction for counsel in the sheriff court, although at the discretion of the sheriff, is very likely to be granted in complex cases, especially in cases in which the other side has employed counsel. We will lodge amendments to ensure that the test for remitting cases in which counsel is automatic is not too strict. Although the rules on sanction for counsel are for the Lord President, the Court of Session and the Scottish Civil Justice Council to consider, I make it clear that there is no intention that the test that was suggested by Sheriff Principal Taylor&#8217;s review should be applied more stringently.</p><p>In relation to workplace injuries, the cabinet secretary has indicated that he is open to further discussion with the STUC on issues of concern to it including the principle that personal injury cases under simple procedure will have specific rules. John Finnie&#8217;s proposal may not be competent because health and safety is a reserved matter&#8212;we should keep that at the forefront of our minds.</p><p>On the concerns about a single appeal sheriff, the Government continues to believe that, given the procedural nature of civil appeals, an appeal sheriff will be suitably qualified to hear the appeal. However, the quorum of the court will be for court rules and the decision on which appeal sheriffs will form the judicial complement of the sheriff appeal court in individual cases will be a matter for the president and vice-president of that court.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Courts Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-05-21", "body": "<p>That will be a matter for the president and vice-president of the sheriff appeal court. It may be that, in an individual case, it will be considered that the sheriff principal should sit or it may be decided otherwise.</p><p>The committee has asked for further information on the capacity of the courts. Margaret Mitchell raised the spectre of thousands of cases transferring all at once. Cases will not transfer all at once: cases that have started in the Court of Session will stay in the Court of Session. It is new cases that will be raised in the sheriff court.</p><p>We have heard about the dramatically falling numbers of civil cases in the sheriff courts. Recently released statistics show a substantial reduction in the number of civil cases being heard at sheriff court level, with a drop of around 8,000 cases between 2011-12 and 2012-13 and a drop of more than 50,000 cases since 2008-09. The transfer of those cases should also be seen in the context of other improvements, such as better and more streamlined processes in court and better case management.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell also raised the issue of court closures. I simply reiterate that the closures will result in the redistribution of only 5 per cent of sheriff court business to other nearby courts, with staff and judiciary also transferring. Fluctuating demand can be managed and the Scottish Court Service has stated that the changes will result in more efficient and effective court services.</p><p>I will take a little time to respond to some of the points made in the debate. Liam McArthur and Alison McInnes raised the issue of honorary sheriffs. I have written to Liam McArthur, so he knows that we will not abolish honorary sheriffs until alternative arrangements are in place.</p><p>The financial memorandum was subject to considerable discussion. The memorandum notes that savings are expected to be generated from efficiencies released. The reforms are about a reorganisation of the existing resources of the courts, as well as doing things in the most efficient way possible.</p><p>Although we have included figures in the financial memorandum on the up-front investment required, for example in the Scottish Civil Justice Council, we do not expect significant additional investment to be necessary. The policy on court fees is to move towards full cost recovery over time regardless of the courts reform process. The last round of court fees orders in 2012 included an above-inflation rise with that portion contributing to those up-front costs. The next fees orders are expected to be laid in 2015 and they will be consulted on before being scrutinised by Parliament.</p><p>Eric McQueen stated to the Justice Committee that the Scottish Court Service does not expect to see a large overall increase in the total amount of fees recovered for the cost of civil business. Lord Gill said:</p><p>&#8220;From the work that has been done by the Scottish Court Service and the Scottish Civil Justice Council, I am absolutely satisfied that the reforms can be adequately funded. They are part of the long-term planning of the Scottish Court Service.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 22 April 2014; c 4536.]</p><p>I will deal with just a couple of the very specific issues that were raised. Malcolm Chisholm made a couple of points. He mentioned that there would be no increase in sitting days, but that is compared with the figure for 2011-12, which was used in the financial memorandum. It is possible not to increase the number of sitting days because the civil case load has decreased since then. The SCS has confirmed that that number of sitting days would be sufficient for the expected level of business. Malcolm Chisholm also wondered how the legal aid costs could fall if sanction for counsel is rarely refused. Sanction for counsel is rarely refused when needed; that position is likely to continue in the future.</p><p>John Pentland mentioned that no percentages of cases were considered in the choice of &#163;150,000 as the limit. Lord Gill estimated that that limit would take around two thirds of cases from the general department of the Court of Session and 25 per cent from the commercial courts, so some percentages are available.</p><p>Graeme Pearson talked about the need for advocates even if only at the point of settlement rather than the point of proof. However, the Faculty of Advocates and the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers have agreed that there was no evidence that cases are settled earlier in the Court of Session than in the sheriff court. That suggests that an advocate is not essential in that regard.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Courts Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-05-21", "body": "<p>I am conscious that it is time to sum up, Presiding Officer. The reforms are about a vision for the future of the courts in Scotland.

I commend the motion to the Parliament.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Courts Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-04-30", "body": "<p>I congratulate Graeme Pearson on securing the debate and on the careful and sympathetic way in which he handled a difficult subject&#8212;the same applies to all the members who have spoken.</p><p>I will start by responding to issues that lie in the justice portfolio. Members will realise that a number of aspects of the debate range into the health portfolio, and I will address those, too.</p><p>It is useful to remind ourselves that there is no time bar for criminal prosecutions. Tonight&#8217;s debate is entirely about civil justice. Sometimes, the lines of conversation are blurred around that, although I do not suggest that members tonight have done that. There is no time limit in the criminal law of Scotland for raising prosecutions in respect of any case. What we are talking about is all connected with the civil law alone.</p><p>For claims that are raised under the civil law, it is in the interest of all members of society to have an effective framework that allows cases to be resolved quickly and fairly. That applies to both sides of the coin. As some members know, we have consulted on a range of issues that relate to damages for personal injury, on the basis of Scottish Law Commission recommendations.</p><p>Modest as those recommendations were&#8212;I will say a little more about them&#8212;there was no clear consensus on many of them. For example, on the time bar, there was not even universal agreement on the move from a three-year to a five-year limitation period for personal injury claims. The current limit for financial loss is five years. It has always seemed odd to me that people have more time to contemplate financial loss than personal injury, but even that modest recommendation could not attract widespread support. People must remember that we need to look at the bigger time-bar issue.</p><p>The commission did not recommend that special provision should be made for any specific category of pursuer. Its recommendations recognised that there is merit in having a limitation period that applies universally. However, the commission also made recommendations that would enable pursuers&#8217; personal circumstances to be taken into account when the time bar is considered.</p><p>We need to exercise caution when we make comparisons with what other jurisdictions have done, although I do not recall any members making such comparisons tonight. Many jurisdictions that have removed the time bar from their systems do not have the discretion that is available to our judges to disapply the time bar. I know that there is controversy about whether judges are applying that discretion as widely as they can, but it is a valuable tool to enable time-bar issues in difficult cases to be properly considered. We have the capacity to expand and enhance that part of our system.</p><p>I should say something about apologies and Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s proposed bill, which I have met her to discuss. I put it on record that the proposal&#8217;s aim&#8212;to encourage and protect the giving of apologies by private and public bodies to achieve a better outcome for victims and reduce the number of cases that result in litigation&#8212;is desirable. However, the devil is always in the detail&#8212;I have had that conversation with the member. Until we have seen the final proposal, it is hard for me to take a firm view. However, I look forward to continuing to work with the member on the issue. I agree that it is a significant part of the entire debate that we look closely at the capacity for us to introduce something along those lines.</p><p>Although I have talked about a couple of direct justice portfolio issues, a range of work is being taken forward across the Scottish Government. I was disappointed that the motion did not refer to the national confidential forum, so I am glad that Graeme Pearson raised it. The forum is another way in which we are acknowledging and recognising survivors of institutional child abuse. We have built on the time to be heard pilot forum and legislated for the NCF through the recent Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2014.</p><p>We have had great support from survivors, who have given us their advice about the legislation and about how the NCF should operate. It is good that the debate gives me the chance to thank them for their contribution, so recently given. The NCF will give survivors of institutional child abuse the right to give their testimony to an independent panel in whatever way they choose. The forum has a statutory duty to signpost services that may be useful to participants. It will make it easier for survivors to report abuse allegations to the police and it will also benefit children now by highlighting why abuse happened in institutions and what can be done to prevent abuse happening in the same settings today. We know that survivors are very keen to prevent any child from being abused and their testimony at the NCF will be an important part of that. Members will be happy to hear that we hope to have the forum operational in the autumn of this year.</p><p>It is likely that I will overrun my allotted seven minutes, Presiding Officer, but, with your indulgence, I think that the issues are important enough to allow that to happen.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Institutional Child Abuse"}, {"date": "2014-04-30", "body": "<p>The survivor Scotland strategy was mentioned by a number of members. It is now almost 10 years since it started its groundbreaking work in 2005. Under the strategy, and with the advice and support of survivors, support agencies and other stakeholders, many projects are providing a huge range of services to thousands of survivors. In that time, we have invested more than &#163;6 million. I think that it was Neil Bibby who referred to that. More than &#163;1.5 million will have been spent on establishing the support agency, the in care survivor service Scotland, which will be up and running next year. Those are concrete things that are happening now. I would not like members to go away with the impression that everything has stalled. It has not&#8212;things are continuing to happen.</p><p>I am also pleased that the motion highlights the SHRC&#8217;s action plan. We have worked with the SHRC and other stakeholders in the interaction and we think that it has been a very valuable process. It would be premature for me to make any response about the commitments that are proposed in that plan until after we have seen the results of the consultation on the plan. The Government hopes to be able to make a full response next month. Unfortunately, the debate is this month. I know that everybody who has spoken in the debate will be waiting eagerly to see what that response is. That will include a decision on a reparation scheme, which was mentioned by a few members, including Graeme Pearson, Sandra White and Neil Bibby. I need to put on record that the Government is still committed to scoping out a possible reparation scheme. However, as I said, we need to wait until we see the outcome of the consultation on the action plan.</p><p>That leads me on to the bigger issue of the public inquiry, which a number of members have raised. Not everyone is absolutely convinced of its necessity. Again, that is reflected in the interaction and in some of the other contributions. There is no unanimity about the issue. The motion speaks about a full public inquiry, but it is important to note that the action plan does not include that in its recommendations, although it considered it carefully. Among the concerns about holding an inquiry were that it might take a very long time, that outcomes might not offer tangible support, that it might be expensive and that it would have the potential for conflict and further trauma. Those are not glib reasons for being unconvinced about having a public inquiry; they are carefully thought-through reasons in that interaction process. We have to listen carefully to that. I would not want to be in a position of saying never, but I think that we have to listen carefully to the conflicted views on the issue and not assume that there is unanimity.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Institutional Child Abuse"}, {"date": "2014-04-30", "body": "<p>We are running quite late.

We should be a little bit careful about making assumptions about what is happening. [Interruption.] Mr Pearson might find that the third element does not necessarily bring what is required.</p><p>A number of survivors and other stakeholders were not convinced that a public inquiry is the best option, and they considered that there have been enough reviews and inquiries, some of which have been mentioned already, such as the Kerelaw school inquiry and the historical abuse systemic inquiry that was carried out by Tom Shaw. However, we have agreed to commission an independent exercise by experts at the centre of excellence for looked-after children in Scotland.</p><p>A lot is happening, and still more is in progress.

Yes, we will need to face up to the real challenges that independence will bring, but we will do that with the dignity of being able to tackle those challenges using our people&#8217;s undoubted skills, intelligence and ability.</p><p>The dignity of being normal is all that I seek.</p><p>The respect that Scotland has on the world stage matters very deeply to me and goes to the core of why I think that it is hugely important that Scotland chooses to vote yes. A yes vote will make me very happy, but the respect that we will gain from having a constitution for Scotland that outlaws weapons of mass destruction from our land is what I seek most. Providing Scotland&#8212;and, indeed, the rest the UK&#8212;with the opportunity to press the restart button on the obscenity of nuclear weapons is, on its own, reason enough for me to want independence.</p><p>The debate on whether Trident should remain on the Clyde has tended to centre on the cost, the economy and its effectiveness or otherwise as a deterrent. Yes, the cost of renewing Trident is truly abhorrent at &#163;100 billion, and more and more significant military experts question its strategic relevance in today&#8217;s world but, for me, the debate goes way beyond those parameters. I want the respect of living in a normal country, because not having nuclear weapons is the normal condition of the overwhelming majority of the world&#8217;s countries. I want Scotland to be respected and not feared, as the UK is, through the politics of power and domination and through hanging on to the last vestiges of its imperial past.</p><p>This is Scotland&#8217;s one opportunity to gain respect by building an alternative future as a co-operator and a peacemaker, promoting international law and social justice.

This year sees the 700th anniversary of the battle of Bannockburn and King Robert the Bruce&#8217;s victory over King Edward II. In recognising this special year in Scottish history, the Scottish Government has invested, along with others, in a new and exciting National Trust for Scotland Bannockburn visitor centre, which is already becoming legendary in its own right.

I fought on King Edward&#8217;s side and won, and that made me understand how difficult things must have been for Robert the Bruce.</p><p>The renovation work on the rotunda and on the magnificent equestrian statue of King Robert the Bruce on the field of Bannockburn is truly remarkable. Anyone who gets a chance to see it will find that some of the detail on that equestrian statue is absolutely stunning, and I was delighted to be there on the day, earlier this year, when Lord Elgin came along to unveil the statue of his ancestor.

The 2014 homecoming year was kicked off early and in style by Stirling&#8217;s Hogmanay party at Stirling castle, headlined by Deacon Blue. It was watched by more than 1.3 million live television viewers; money cannot buy that type of exposure, either for Stirling or for Scotland. The economic benefit calculations that were done both for Stirling city and for the wider Scottish economy were quite significant.</p><p>Other outstanding events add to the superbly diverse offer in Stirling in 2014.

Abolishing the right to buy social rented housing will have a very positive effect on all those involved in the sector. It will protect and enhance social housing, and it will protect the public investment that has been made in such housing over generations.</p><p>Since the right to buy was introduced, around 455,000 properties have been taken out of the social rented sector, and that continual depletion of social housing stock is unsustainable in the face of continued high levels of need for social housing in Scotland. As a representative from Shelter has said, the right to buy is like trying to fill a sink without the plug in. Moreover, David Bookbinder of the Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland told the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee:</p><p>&#8220;The key benefit is supply. ... The certainty that abolishing right to buy will give local authorities, landlord local authorities and housing associations with regard to their strategic and business planning roles&#8212;they will know how much rental income they will have and how much stock they can use for allocations and homelessness&#8212;will be a huge benefit.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, 22 January 2014; c 2429.]</p><p>Removing the right to buy will give social landlords greater confidence to build new homes, and 15,500 social rented houses will be safeguarded for future generations.</p><p>As we know, many right-to-buy properties end up in the private rented sector, where the rents are higher and higher benefit claims can be made.</p><p>The protection of the social rented stock, together with the Government&#8217;s commitment to build new social housing, is welcomed by the sector. Some 30,292 housing association homes have been completed since 2007-08, which is a rise of 7 per cent on the previous seven years, and 1,324 council houses were completed in 2013-14 alone. That is a far cry from the six that were built in the last four years of the Labour-Lib Dem Administration.</p><p>Abolition of the right to buy and other aspects of the bill will increase the flexibility that social landlords have when they allocate homes to allow them to better respond to their communities&#8217; needs and make better use of affordable rented housing.</p><p>I turn to the legislation on mobile homes. There are a number of mobile homes in my constituency and I welcome the strengthening of the protection for those who live in them. People in my area who contacted me about the legislation seemed to be content with the way in which their site was run, but I was really surprised by how little they knew about the existence of organisations that represent those who live in park homes. Many sites are well run, but there is definitive evidence of unscrupulous landlords. Giving local authorities more powers in that area is therefore very welcome. I look forward to seeing the new model standards for mobile home sites reflecting up-to-date best practice.</p><p>I cannot conclude without commenting on Labour members&#8217; cynical stance on the bill. Mary Fee said that the abolition of the right to buy was long overdue. Labour had eight years to abolish it, but they did not do so.</p><p>James Kelly said that he spoke about rents in one of Labour&#8217;s debates in December.

I would like to begin by inviting members who believe that they might not get an opportunity to participate in the debate to feel free to intervene on me if they have a specific question.</p><p>The Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill is an empowering bill: it will empower our people with disabilities to lead full and fulfilling lives by enabling them to exercise their right to use the blue badge to which they are entitled to find legitimate parking spaces in our towns and cities.</p><p>I am very grateful to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee for scrutinising the bill at stages 1 and 2. I believe that the scrutiny that it undertook was fair, transparent and just. It considered in great depth questions that many people have been asking for quite some time. Why are we only now trying to ensure that people who have a blue badge can use it in a manner that gives them the freedom that I mentioned?</p><p>At stage 2, Inclusion Scotland lodged some amendments, and I am grateful to the committee for scrutinising them and giving them a great deal of consideration. I think that the conclusion was that, during the consultation process, people with disabilities believed that proceeding to enact the bill was the right and proper thing to do.</p><p>The consultation allowed me to listen to people with disabilities across Scotland. In the consultation meetings that we had in Aberdeen, Glasgow and here in Edinburgh, people with disabilities and organisations representing them were afforded the opportunity to ask important and appropriate questions about what was being proposed to ensure that we took forward what the bill was intended to achieve.</p><p>Under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, which introduced what was then the orange badge, people with disabilities were for the first time given concessions with regard to parking rights. However, it quickly became clear that the system was open to abuse. People came up with counterfeit badges, badges were being openly transferred, and third-party misuse was rife. It was felt that the legislation needed to be tightened up, and steps in that direction have been taken throughout the years. I now believe that the current badge system is robust, and, because of the unique number that each badge has, there should be little or no opportunity for fraudulent behaviour or copying.</p><p>In fact, the badge&#8217;s unique number is very important, because it will enable those who look at it, whether they be the police, traffic wardens or other local authority representatives who are charged with enforcing the system, to find out the badge&#8217;s legitimate owner. If they suspect that a badge is being misused, they can run a check. If, for example, the person using the vehicle is in their early 20s and the badge has been issued to someone in their 80s, the people who enforce the system will have every right to approach the person in question and ask whether the badge is legitimate or whether it is being misappropriated.</p><p>It is already illegal to use a badge that should have been returned because, for example, of the owner&#8217;s death, or to use a badge that has been lost or stolen, so people must be made aware that such actions are criminal offences. Indeed, it is only right and proper that people with disabilities themselves take some responsibility for their blue badges. During the consultation process, it became very clear that many people who have a blue badge were not aware of the rules and regulations about their use. One of the biggest complaints that we hear is that people think that third-party misuse is okay because the person who is using the badge is, say, going to the shops on behalf of the person with the disability. Of course, that is not the purpose of the badge, but if people with disabilities think that that sort of thing is okay, that suggests that we need to think about educating those people about the use of badges.</p><p>During the consultation process, we decided that it would be in the best interests of people with disabilities to set up two working groups. Those groups include representation from Police Scotland, local authorities and people with disabilities, and we are looking at producing for those who are issued with a blue badge something that will be an easy read that will make things clear and which will give, say, the top 10 tips for its use.</p><p>My thanks go to people with disabilities because, without the consultation process and their guidance, we would not be at the stage that we are at today.</p><p>Why do we need the bill? We need it because people think that it is okay to park in disabled parking spaces without a blue badge. As I said, people also think that third-party misuse of a blue badge is okay, although it is not. We as a society should not tolerate that. We should look at the impact of such misuse on people with disabilities. When someone misuses a badge, they do not just take a parking space; they also deny a parking space to someone with a disability. When that person is denied a parking space, they might have to return home and might not be able to do what they went into town for, whether that be leisure, pleasure or business&#8212;it makes no difference. People need to understand that they are not just taking a parking space that was available; they are denying a parking space to someone with a disability who is looking for one.</p><p>Just the other week, someone said to me, &#8220;I know it&#8217;s wrong, but I was in a hurry&#8212;I was going to be late for work. I couldn&#8217;t find a parking space, so I just parked in the blue badge space.&#8221; Such excuses should not be acceptable to us. They are not acceptable to me and I do not think that they are acceptable to the Parliament. I sincerely hope that we will hear other examples this afternoon that show why we need to pass the bill.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>In winding up, I first extend my sincere thanks to those who managed to speak during this short, but very important, debate. I also offer my genuine thanks to the minister for supporting me through the process and to the team from Transport Scotland, without whose guidance I think I would have found it virtually impossible to take the bill forward. They were absolutely fantastic at guiding me through the process. As Kevin Stewart rightly said, thanks should also go to my own staff, who have been extremely supportive. I also extend my thanks to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee for its scrutiny of the bill at stages 1 and 2. Stewart Stevenson was appointed at stage 2 to enable the process to meet the requirements of Parliament, so I extend my sincere thanks to him for assisting me in the process at stage 2.</p><p>As we have said before, the bill is small, but it will have a significant impact for people with disabilities, given the powers that we are looking to provide to local authorities. It is about enforcement. As has already been said, any enforcement will be done sensitively and in a manner that will not cause anxiety to badge holders.</p><p>I thank the minister for addressing most of the points that Stewart Stevenson raised in his intervention. All blue badges will continue to have a photograph, but it is at the request of people with disabilities themselves that the badge will remain face down. It is the unique identification number on each badge that will ensure that the badge holder will be identified in any enforcement process.</p><p>Cameron Buchanan mentioned the analogy of taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There is no intention of doing that&#8212;there will be no need to, because we will have the information on the database. We will not go to every blue badge holder and investigate, because there is no reason to. What we are trying to do is to establish the evidence of a pattern of misuse. Gordon Catchlove does that in Edinburgh. When he gave evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee at stage 1 he explained how he goes about his function. It is at that point that we can determine whether a badge is being misused.</p><p>The bill represents a review process. Since the new criteria came about, the right of review if their application is turned down has not been afforded to a person with a disability. Their application will now be looked at again and the criteria examined to ensure that, if the person genuinely requires a blue badge, they will be afforded one.</p><p>At stage 1 of the bill, only 20 local authorities had a review process; I can confirm that all 32 local authorities have now put one in place. That is progress, and the local authorities are to be commended.</p><p>We have come a long way on this journey, but we still have a long way to go. Will the introduction of the bill stop universal misuse? I believe not. Will it prick the consciences of those who are determined to misuse the badge? I believe not. What it has done and will do is to raise awareness, not just through the media but among badge holders themselves.</p><p>Cameron Buchanan said that the guidelines that we give people when we issue a blue badge are important. Cameron admitted that when he received the regulations, he took one look at them and put them in a drawer. I sincerely hope that, through common sense and use of his blue badge, he has not had a parking ticket&#8212;apart from the time in London that he mentioned. It is not just about blue badge spaces; it is about using the blue badge to ensure that if there is a single yellow line or a double yellow line, someone can park appropriately, provided that there are no other restrictions.</p><p>Christine Grahame mentioned private car parks. Like the minister, I wrote to the supermarket chains and the retail outlets asking them what they had done to monitor use of blue badge spaces. I give an undertaking to Parliament today to write once again to the supermarket chains and retail outlets to ask them to step up to the plate and&#8212;on the back of the bill, if it is passed this afternoon, which I sincerely hope it will be&#8212;to look at ways of enforcing the use of the blue badge spaces within those private areas.</p><p>It is important to ensure that our health boards step up to the plate, too. They already have the means to monitor blue badge spaces and to ensure that they are appropriately used. I will be asking the health boards to ensure that&#8212;again, on the back of the bill&#8212;they, too, look at ways in which they can enforce use of their disabled parking spaces.</p><p>It has been an enjoyable if lengthy process. My thanks go to all those who participated in the consultation and all those who want a bill that will give them better use of their blue badge. I hope that it is a bill that will prick the consciences of people who have misused badges. It will also give us the guidelines that we so desperately need to try to ensure that a person with a disability can use their badge appropriately and without confusion.</p><p>I thank Parliament and every member who has participated in the process&#8212;through stages 1 and 2 and in this afternoon&#8217;s short but concise debate&#8212;for offering sincere assurances that they will support the bill through to the end of the process this afternoon.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p></p><p>4.

That was not always the case, of course. In the past, because Aberdeen is a harbour port, many merchant seamen used to jump ship and seek asylum, certainly back in the 80s and 90s.</p><p>Aberdeen has always welcomed people from all nations and migrants from all parts of the world. I remember my very first encounter with someone from a different country. My aunt&#8217;s husband came from Lagos in Nigeria. Unfortunately, when he returned to Nigeria, he died as a reporter in the wars there. My nephews were deemed to be different at that time, but not because of a sense of annoyance or hatred; they were just seen as different. In the early 60s, there were very few people from a black ethnic minority in the very small place where I lived.</p><p>Before the debate, I wondered what the process is for someone who wants to seek asylum, who perhaps underwent horrendous difficulties in getting to these shores. When they get here, who do they turn to? What is their first thought? Where do they go? When they want to seek asylum, what is the process? I applaud the wonderful strategy put forward by the Scottish Government, COSLA and the third sector, and I thought that if I was an asylum seeker fleeing a country where I was in fear of not just the military but the police, would I want to go to a police station to ask for asylum? Perhaps not.</p><p>Would I use modern technology to find out what the process was? I might have access to the internet if I had just arrived in Glasgow, Edinburgh or Aberdeen. However, I looked at the websites of Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council, which make absolutely no reference to asylum seekers or people seeking refuge. I contacted one of the councils, pointed that out and asked it to investigate. It came back to me and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re right. There&#8217;s nothing on our website.&#8221;</p><p>If I was someone coming to this country who was in fear of going to the police because of past experience, who would I turn to? I ask the minister, in all sincerity, whether we have thought about how people who seek asylum and refuge in this country embark on that first step. It might be that we do something as simple as putting something on the internet&#8212;Google or whatever&#8212;but we need to ensure that people have access to the first step of the process.</p><p>I condemn the Azure card system, which is absolutely dreadful. We moved away from the voucher system because that removed people&#8217;s dignity and stigmatised them. The card system does exactly the same&#8212;it does nothing other than stigmatise people. It does not give them the freedom to go into a shop and buy what they need, when they need it, and it does not give them the freedom to use public transport, because it is not accepted on public transport.</p><p>I believe that the strategy that has been put forward by the Scottish Government in collaboration with COSLA and the third sector is the right way to go, and I commend the Government&#8217;s motion.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers and Refugees"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>Would the member welcome it if the asylum seeker process for those in Scotland were to be carried out in Glasgow instead of their having to go down to Croydon?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers and Refugees"}, {"date": "2014-06-12", "body": "<p></p><p>4.

It is worrying that the convener of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee and I seem to agree on quite a number of matters. Perhaps some of my persuasions are rubbing off on him.</p><p>Like Willie Rennie and Murdo Fraser, I am male and no longer young&#8212;young at heart perhaps&#8212;but I perhaps represent a minority group. The cabinet secretary mentioned the can do initiative, which took me back an earlier stage in my life when I was looking forward to my career. In my case, it would have been so simple to sit back and think about barriers, obstacles, hazards and reasons&#8212;often presented by my family and teachers&#8212;why I should not get into a certain profession. Maybe it is my stubbornness, but I think that it is about the can-do mentality. We need to realise that; I think that the cabinet secretary probably does, thanks to her social work training days. As someone who did not aspire to a degree but who followed a professional qualification, I am aware that that mentality takes ambition, strength and determination. Our young people have the determination and the qualities that can inspire them to become the entrepreneurs of the future.</p><p>We must look not only at where we are today but to the future&#8212;the mid to long term. I have been reading Sir Iain Wood&#8217;s report, which has just been published. Much of it reflects the can-do mentality to which we can all aspire. However, Sir Iain Wood highlights some of the barriers that prevent some of our young people from taking the initial step. Other members have mentioned some of those barriers, such as the culture. That culture is not just down to the way that we are taught in schools; it is also sometimes embedded in the home and our families. Grandparents tell their grandchildren that they should not go into a certain profession and that they would be better sticking to something else. We need to ensure that we break down those stereotypes.</p><p>When I was on the Equal Opportunities Committee, we considered women in work and went back to look at how we project things even at nursery and in the education of our young children&#8212;even how we present toys to children. When my two girls were four and were asked what they would like from Santa, they asked for racing cars. I thought that we had broken the mould because they wanted racing cars as opposed to Barbies and, when they got the Barbies in a pram, they dismantled the pram and made it into a go-kart. Perhaps we got rid of the stereotypes and perhaps they were doing things that I had aspired to but never managed to do.</p><p>We must consider how to provide the appropriate opportunities for our young people in the early stages. The curriculum for excellence is the pathway for that. It opens doors for many of our young children&#8212;boys and girls&#8212;so that they can aspire to be what they would like to be. We should not create barriers. We should consider their can-do&#8212;what they would like to do&#8212;and reinforce that as best we can.</p><p>Quite rightly, not every young person will aspire to go to university. If they choose to go down the vocational route, we should applaud that. Murdo Fraser was absolutely right&#8212;I take that back; he was right, but I cannot give him an &#8220;absolutely&#8221;&#8212;to say that, in Germany, people are rewarded and applauded for going into vocational education.

As I reflected on my own experience of the Edinburgh festival, particularly the fringe, I thought that what excites me about it is that it is live performance. Members will know that I have a particular interest in music. I was up the road in the Canongate church only last week for a live performance of Bach&#8217;s &#8220;Mass in B minor&#8221;, which is a magnificent work that I had never heard live before. It was a stunningly professional performance and a moving experience. At some point last week, I was in St Giles cathedral, where the resident organist, Peter Backhouse, played a wonderful instrument with a wide variety of sounds. I remember that, at the end, he got Louis Vierne&#8217;s &#8220;Carillon de Westminster&#8221; going, and there was a growling from that instrument that can only be experienced by being there. It is a physical experience and it is an absolutely fabulous live experience.</p><p>I also went with my wife to see &#8220;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&#8221;, which is a wonderful parody for how one might succeed in politics without really trying, and it was a fabulous performance by students from the University of Dundee. It brought back memories for my wife, but we do not discuss from how long ago. Also, if members have not heard our own Fred MacAulay discussing current political life, I did so last night and he is on good form. I recommend it.</p><p>Nanette Milne talked about the Aberdeen international youth festival. It is a fabulous activity, parts of which get down to my part of the world in north Angus and the Mearns. It gets to Stonehaven, Montrose, Brechin and Laurencekirk. That is hugely important because it means that those youngsters come to different environments and often small venues with enthusiastic audiences who get to hear something that they would otherwise never get to hear.</p><p>At Stonehaven town hall recently, we had a typical concert with the Madison boy choir from Wisconsin, the Blackburn with Darwen Music Service Big Band from Lancashire, and some traditional Scots musicians that have been previously discussed. After the concert, when I looked at some of the material that had been produced by some of those organisations, the faces were different from those we saw last year. I was reminded that these groups develop from year to year and we are still handing down the traditions and skills from one year group to the next. They are learning their craft from those who are at the front and from the performers who are around them at time.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>Can I say that I will try.</p><p>I will discuss local festivals, if I may, because north Angus and the Mearns are absolutely full of them. Forfar, my biggest town, has the Forfarfest in May and the Forfar harvest fest in September. Brechin&#8217;s music festival is a long weekend at the end of August. The Montrose music festival happened earlier in the summer and, uniquely in my part of the world, they set up bang in the middle of town outside the townhouse and people can probably hear the music from miles away. These festivals bring all sorts together and they have all sorts of small performances, mostly in pubs and church halls because those are the kinds of venue that we have, and they all work because everybody mucks in and makes it happen.</p><p>The same applies to the Stonehaven folk festival, which happened a couple of weeks ago. I have a happy memory of sitting on the harbour wall listening to Iain McFadden playing his pipes on one side and traditional musicians over the other side; I could hear them both mingling across the water. Stonehaven also has the world paper-and-comb championships in St Bridget&#8217;s hall. It is a serious event, folks, and highly recommended.</p><p>More poignant this year is the Mearns connection festival, which happens at the Grassic Gibbon centre near Arbuthnott. Of course, Lewis Grassic Gibbon is famous for &#8220;Sunset Song&#8221;, a story set during the first world war that depicts the Mearns, in which he lived and wrote. There is an extraordinary poignancy about that this year.</p><p>We also have a new festival&#8212;Scotland&#8217;s tea festival in Laurencekirk, which I am sure will come as news to members. It begins very soon&#8212;22 August&#8212;and celebrates the local man, James Taylor, who apparently more or less invented the Ceylon tea industry in the 1880s after disease had wiped out the coffee crop. Not only did we invent most of the things in the world, but it appears that we even invented Ceylon tea.</p><p>Members have mentioned non-musical events, so I would like to mention the Johnshaven fish festival, which is an annual event down at the harbour in Johnshaven, with stalls, music and a wonderful raft race.</p><p>All those festivals have to be organised.

Our capacity is largely limited by what we think we can do, although it is of course also limited by our opportunities and, in particular, the educational opportunities that we have when we are young. Although the Scottish Government has made a huge commitment to music through Sistema Scotland, we need to work hard to ensure that instrumental tuition in our schools is developed. I know that that is not within the cabinet secretary&#8217;s remit, but it is enormously important that our youngsters have an opportunity to do those musical things.

It is an absolutely fabulous and iconic bird sanctuary. Of course, its importance is because of not just the birds but everything else that lives round the basin&#8212;a point to which I will return. When I visited the basin, the top brass turned up and the manager was there, so I got to see it the way that they wanted me to see it. However, the people who really make the SWT work are the volunteers. I want to point out that, without them, it just would not happen. They are the ones who are there when nobody else is and who ensure that the 12,000 or so visitors each year to Montrose Basin get a welcome and the information that they need. I notice that there are 2,500 educational visits each year, which adds up to pretty much every local school being engaged and getting there pretty often.</p><p>The programme tells me that one activity at the basin is called &#8220;Mud Glorious Mud!&#8221; but then boringly it tells me that that is for children, which I think is pretty unreasonable, really. Apparently, there is also a half-mile walk out to the middle of the basin&#8212;I have not done it, but I guess that people need Stewart Stevenson&#8217;s aforementioned wellies and that they must remember to come back before the water does, because it is a respecter of no man.</p><p>I guess that the highlight is in late September or early October, when some 60,000 pink-footed geese decide to take off at about half-past six in the morning to look for breakfast in the local fields.

That is an important indicator of how such things can be made to work. If organisations engage with the local community and local industry, there are ways and means of extracting significant sums of money not only to get a visitor centre built but to have it refurbished. That is an important part of what the SWT does. I note in passing that, as well as all the pink-footed geese and many other species, we have ospreys in the area, which are rarer in Scotland even than golden eagles. That is maybe something that we will develop.</p><p>I will close by going back to the issue that Claudia Beamish and Rob Gibson mentioned, which is biodiversity, because I would like to reiterate a hugely important point on that.</p><p>We can try to measure biodiversity. A report from the Scottish Wildlife Trust makes the point that it is easier to measure the bigger species, rather more difficult to measure the smaller ones and extremely difficult to count the bugs and beetles. However, I suggest that it is impossible to count the even smaller beasties.

The Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee challenged whether that should be subject to consultation. The Government came back robustly and said no, that it feels that the court service should be able to establish its own specialist courts as it sees fit, and that it would do its own consultation. In retrospect and on reflection, that seems to me to be entirely appropriate.</p><p>I take on board Rod Campbell&#8217;s earlier comment about the fact that there might be a commercial court in Glasgow, but remoter regions might struggle to get that kind of service. It occurs to me that it would be entirely appropriate for the Lord President to set up a commercial court in Aberdeen or wherever, perhaps for the time being, to deal with those things. He really does not need our advice on how to do that.</p><p>It seems to me that it is a very good thing that the sheriff court appeals system should be binding nationally. There is very little sense in holding on to the idea that sheriffs principal should make appeals only for their sheriffdom. However, I wonder whether the idea of a single sheriff on the bench at appeals is the right way to proceed. I think that history tells us that appeal cases are often improved if there are three members on a bench. I recognise that there would be a cost implication to that, but I suspect that that might be where we want to go with appeals.</p><p>Finally, Citizens Advice Scotland pointed out how important in-court advice can be.

However, it has shone a light on an issue that it perhaps did not intend to. The future delivery of services in our communities, especially our rural communities, is worthy of consideration, not least because it is beyond any doubt that fractures have developed in the relationship between the general public and general practitioners. If my mailbag is anything to go by, the principal cause of that is the difficulty that people encounter when they seek to secure surgery-based appointments, let alone home visits.</p><p>Having spent half a day shadowing in a busy GP practice in Carnoustie last year, I am not without sympathy for some of the challenges faced by those charged with delivering the services. There is unquestionably an issue over attracting locums and indeed the next generation of GPs. Demand for appointments in Carnoustie is 50 per cent higher than the national average. Ironically, up-and-coming GPs encounter a greatly reduced workload in surgeries that are based in some deprived city areas in comparison with surgeries in more affluent rural areas, such as Angus. That draws many GPs to the conurbations.</p><p>The likes of Carnoustie and nearby Monifieth also have a growing ageing population, with the service demand that that presents. NHS Tayside responded to that with a pilot project over the winter months, which aimed to assist in dealing with dementia sufferers and prevent avoidable hospital admission. However, although the pilot was so successful that it is to be extended, those issues will not go away.</p><p>There is also the bane of any GP practice: the patients who want a doctor to remove a splinter from their finger or provide antibiotics for a cold, or who insist on seeing a specific GP.</p><p>It is worth noting that GP numbers in Scotland have gone up by 5.7 per cent under this Government and that the sum invested in primary care services in 2012-13 was 10 per cent more than in 2006.</p><p>In the interests of balance, it must be said that while additional resources, if available or practically redeployable, could and would alleviate the situation, so too would doctors working the same kind of hours as the wider public. I met a GP practice partner recently after they contacted me about the campaign. They pointed out the levels of depression, stress, divorce and alcoholism in the medical profession and told me that if we politicians would answer one plea from medics it would be not to ask more of GPs because, as a profession, they simply cannot cope and would be put in a position where mistakes would be made. At the same time, they readily acknowledged that their present contracted working week consisted of just eight clinical sessions, with a further session set aside for paperwork.</p><p>General practitioners play a vital role in the health service, where they act as gatekeepers. We would not want them to be placed under such strain that they were making errors, but are we really saying that that sort of working week represents an appropriate return on what, for partners in a GP practice, is a substantial salary, especially when there is an increasing demand for access to services, which somehow has to be met?</p><p>There is a case to be made for the redeployment of financial resources as more services are delivered in our communities, but there has to be give and take on that because the Scottish Government cannot somehow magic up additional sums of money for GP practices.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Your GP Cares Campaign"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>I am simply reflecting the experiences that I have had of talking to GPs in my own constituency.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Your GP Cares Campaign"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>I am simply making the point that there has to be compromise if we are going to make progress, and we have to look at the issues in the round.</p><p>The BMA is quite entitled to speak out on behalf of its members, but so too is the Royal College of Nursing in Scotland. It was interesting to note from the briefing that the RCN provided ahead of the debate that although the number of visits to GP practices has increased from around 21.7 million in 2003-04 to 24.2 million in 2012-13, there was an increase in GP consultations of just 3.9 per cent, in comparison with an increase of 31 per cent for practice nurse consultations.</p><p>If we are to consider how health services should be delivered locally, we also need to look at the roles played by other organisations. An example is the community drop-in service that being provided by Action on Hearing Loss Scotland. Since that service started in Angus in 2010, the organisation has re-tubed 2,700 hearing aids, carried out 2,200 interventions and distributed 25,800 batteries, all of which reduced the workload on the NHS. That was evidenced by reviewed figures that show that, during the past three and a half years, service users have been spared a trip to Ninewells or Stracathro, travelling 17,000 fewer miles, yet, as things stand, that is not matched by funding moving from the NHS to Action on Hearing Loss&#8212;although the organisation will shortly be chapping the door of NHS Tayside. Meanwhile, one local GP practice has announced that it is no longer willing to dispense hearing aid batteries because staff do not have the time.</p><p>There is a debate to be had on the subject, but it needs to be a balanced debate that sees all sides willing to compromise in the interests of ensuring that the needs of the patient are met in the best way.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Your GP Cares Campaign"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p></p><p>9.

Veterans are one group that absolutely comes under the latter heading. If we are honest, I am not sure that we can as a society say that, historically, we have done all that we might have done for veterans, but that has been changing in Scotland over recent years.</p><p>As we all know, Scotland has a long and proud military history, which has been shaped by the efforts of those who have served in our armed forces in the past and those who serve in them in the present. Like Christina McKelvie, I should perhaps declare an interest. Three successive generations on my mother&#8217;s side served in the military, including my grandfather, who won the military cross while serving with the Gordon Highlanders during the second world war.</p><p>We owe a tremendous amount to the men and women of our navy, army and air force, and it is essential that we do all that we can to help and support them when they look to return to civilian life, whether that is at the conclusion of an extended period of service or as a result of an injury that was sustained in the line of duty. We may not always agree with the conflicts in which our armed forces were ordered to participate, but that is frankly irrelevant in respect of our duty of care to them. Having placed those individuals in harm&#8217;s way and all too often subjected them to witnessing events and experiencing traumas that can leave a lasting legacy&#8212;as Alex Fergusson mentioned, that can all too often take time to fully manifest itself&#8212;we must as a society be prepared to provide the appropriate support to them as they seek to reintegrate into everyday society.</p><p>As we have heard, there are approximately 400,000 veterans in Scotland, which is proportionately a larger number than other areas of the UK have. That, of course, presents a challenge to national and local government. With 2,000 personnel leaving the armed forces annually and seeking to return to or move to Scotland, the challenge will become even greater, albeit that, as the minister pointed out, the vast majority of veterans integrate back into civilian life without significant difficulty.</p><p>I do not think that there is any doubting the integrity of the Scottish Government&#8217;s response. Since 2008, &#163;600,000 has gone to ex-service charities from the Scottish veterans fund, a further &#163;200,000 has gone to Veterans Scotland to improve support for veterans over the next two years, &#163;2 million has been dedicated to the new national specialist prosthetics service, and &#163;1.2 million has gone on the provision of specialist mental health services. There has been a &#163;2.3 million grant to the Scottish Veterans Housing Association to provide 50 homes in Glasgow, the concessionary travel scheme has been extended to include forces veterans with mobility problems, and, of course, there is the pending appointment of a Scottish veterans commissioner. The Government has therefore very much backed its words of support for veterans with firm action.</p><p>I am pleased to say that, at the local authority level in my Angus South constituency, Angus Council is also leading by example, particularly in housing. As the minister noted, Angus Council is building a number of wheelchair-accessible properties to be allocated to veterans in Carnoustie. The demolition of the old Camus house care home, which the minister got behind the controls of a JCB to at least symbolically commence some months ago, has paved the way for the location of 11 council properties that are to be made available to the general populace and, in conjunction with the Houses for Heroes Scotland charity, five for use by injured veterans. Angus Council has provided a third of the funding and Houses for Heroes Scotland has provided the rest. I can tell the minister that the project has progressed to the stage at which the foundations for the houses are now being laid.</p><p>That really is a project to be commended, as it integrates housing provision for our veterans within the community. The grouping of veterans&#8217; housing can offer an obvious peer-support mechanism, but it is also important that we do not in any way ghettoise that. The message that is sent out must be that those who locate to such facilities are very much part of the wider community and should be welcomed into it.</p><p>I share the opinion of the chairman of Houses for Heroes Scotland, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Callander, that the partnership that was established with Angus Council is an example to other areas of Scotland. The council has, of course, gone beyond that with the appointment of a veterans champion in the shape of the former Black Watch major Councillor Ronnie Proctor and the establishment of Veterans First, which provides contacts and advice for veterans on topics that range from housing to health, finding new employment and expanding their skill set.</p><p>In case anyone thinks that I am praising Angus Council because it is SNP led, I point out that Councillor Proctor is a Conservative and, if I recall correctly, his predecessor was a Lib Dem. That reflects the cross-party support for the veterans&#8217; cause that exists in Angus and, judging by today&#8217;s speeches, in this chamber.</p><p>Angus is doing its bit, as is the Scottish Government. The unusual degree of consensus in the debate has made crystal clear the Parliament&#8217;s commitment to supporting our veterans community. As the minister noted earlier this year, we cannot rest on our laurels&#8212;more can be done and will need to be done in future.

Scotland has its castles, its nature reserves, its museums and its galleries and many of us marvel at those, but when you are a kid you want something a bit different that chimes with your world. I was reminded of that just last Monday, when I helped to host a visit to the Parliament by a group of young pupils from Inverbrothock primary school in Arbroath. It turned out that their trip to Edinburgh had also involved stopping off at Our Dynamic Earth. I asked one of the youngsters what the best part of their day had been.

In between the two areas there is, if you are a youngster, a great stopping-off point in the shape of the Dundee Science Centre. It is also a great stopping-off point if you are an adult; I certainly enjoyed my visit there. Attractions such as the science centre and the secret bunker are not only a fun day out, but educational; they provide children with information in a fashion that will not be forgotten in a hurry, which is what matters. So often, children are bored by sterile presentations of history, but bring it to life and they will engage.</p><p>It is so important that children learn about events such as the cold war, so that they understand where we have come from and, quite frankly, the dangers posed by still having nuclear weapons in the world. We should all, of course, be thankful that the nuclear bunkers never had to be used for their intended purpose. We should also welcome the fact that many of the 1,600 or so nuclear monitoring posts that were established are now being put to peaceful uses. While some, such as the Troywood bunker, have been turned into education resources, bunkers throughout Scotland have found different uses.</p><p>For example, the bunker under Carruthers house in Dumfries has been used multiple times in emergencies, including during the 1988 Lockerbie disaster and in 2001 during the foot-and-mouth crisis, and for contingency planning when bad weather has hit in recent years. The bunker at Raigmore in the Highlands has been used to co-ordinate responses for numerous disasters, such as the flash flooding in 2002 and when a container holding detonators exploded in Inverness in 2010. The old bunkers have proved their worth over the decades, although not in their intended manner, and we should all be grateful for that.</p><p>Despite the fact that 1,600 of the monitoring rooms were built, I have not been able to find any evidence of one in my constituency, but that might of course be because it is still a secret. However, whether they are acting as a museum or a control room for emergencies, it is good to see those facilities being put to some productive use. I particularly welcome examples of their becoming tourist attractions. In an increasingly competitive market in which Scotland is hindered by not being able to look at reducing air passenger duty and VAT on tourism, we need every advantage that we can muster to entice visitors here. North-east Fife, like Angus, has its top-drawer golf, heritage and scenery attractions, and the Victoria and Albert museum of design will be between the two areas. However, things like the secret bunker are that little bit different and offer that wee bit of novelty, helping to ensure that Scotland stands out from the crowd.</p><p>Although the secret bunker may not be so secret now, it is certainly special.

We do not have to look far in seeking tangible evidence of the positive impact that reducing such taxation can have. Ireland has just scrapped its equivalent of APD and expects 1 million more visitors to come annually as a result.</p><p>On the back of the move, Ryanair has opened up 21 new routes in and out of Dublin, Shannon and Knock, which is not only advantageous for visitors but affords the Irish themselves greater scope for travel, not to mention opening up potential new business opportunities. And there is the rub for Scotland: we are not competing on a level playing field, or one even remotely resembling that, with one of our closest tourism rivals&#8212;rivals with whom we are going head to head in the areas of golf and heritage tourism, particularly in the United States market. Of course, independent Ireland already had an advantage over us, having reduced its VAT rate on tourism&#8212;as 25 other European nations have done&#8212;a little over two and a half years ago.</p><p>The latest move makes it even harder for our industry to take Ireland on. Right now, we are trying to participate in a competitive marketplace with one hand tied behind our back.

The report showed that tourist numbers in Ireland were up; that 10,000 jobs had been created across the industry; and that the tax take from those in employment and from tourist spend in the economy more than made up for the income that the Irish treasury surrendered through the cut.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Air Passenger Duty"}, {"date": "2014-06-03", "body": "<p>I want to develop my point.

I will give three examples involving three different carriers, flying to Philadelphia, New York and Paris in July this year. In the case of Philadelphia, there is a saving of &#163;184 to be made; for New York, the saving is &#163;404 per flight; and for Paris, it is &#163;30 per flight, despite the fact that Edinburgh is closer than Dublin to Paris.</p><p>Unless the issue is tackled, either by having APD devolved or by securing control of it through independence&#8212;which is the more desirable option by far&#8212;we could be facing a bleak time of it, with Scottish holidaymakers snubbing direct flights from this country in favour of cheaper alternatives to be had elsewhere. I do not want Scotland to operate as some sort of regional hub, linking people into London or Dublin; I want Scotland to develop more in the way of comparably affordable direct flights and to properly exploit its potential as a first-choice tourism destination.</p><p>Ryanair&#8217;s Michael O&#8217;Leary has predicted that the full abolition of APD would double the number of visitors to Scotland over five to 10 years.

The PricewaterhouseCoopers report from last year suggested that if APD were abolished across the UK as a whole, that would generate the equivalent of 0.46 per cent of UK GDP in a year, rising to at least &#163;16 billion within three years, leading to the creation of 60,000 jobs.

People from the north of England might just start to travel to an independent Scotland to catch flights from here, rather than the present situation, which is quite the reverse. If an independent Scotland were to reduce and, ultimately, scrap APD, as the UK remained on its present path, the boost to our airline sector and our economy could be significant.</p><p>Scotland-based travellers would surely support our airports instead of heading south in pursuit of a saving, and some travellers from over the border might be tempted north by cheaper fares.</p><p>We need action on the issue, and it needs to go beyond simply devolving APD. Scotland needs control of the measure, as it does over every other power associated with a fully independent country.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Air Passenger Duty"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>Extreme weather patterns that range from intense and sustained periods of wetness to lengthy very dry spells create difficulties for the agricultural sector in Scotland.

Others secure face-to-face meetings that are unlikely to be repeated.</p><p>Then there is that group of organisations that understand how, through advancing well-constructed, considered argument, they can make their case and how, by their actions, they can command respect. The Scottish Wildlife Trust is very much in that category, and I genuinely offer it my warmest congratulations on celebrating its 50th anniversary.</p><p>Perhaps I should declare an interest. Unlike John Wilson, I am not a member of the SWT, but I am something of a fan of the organisation. Indeed, as it knows, I do not just welcome its contributions to issues that the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee may be considering; I have on many occasions found myself proactively seeking its opinions on topics, such is the trust that I have in its knowledge and indeed integrity. As the turnout of MSPs who plan to contribute to the debate indicates, it is clear that I am not alone in holding the SWT in such high regard.</p><p>It is quite funny to look back at the comment of the SWT&#8217;s founder, Sir Charles Connell, when the SWT set out. He said:</p><p>&#8220;some thought the Trust might not obtain adequate support or find work to do which would justify their existence.&#8221;</p><p>O ye of little faith.</p><p>From fairly humble beginnings, the trust&#8217;s membership has grown to 36,500 people. It manages 120 wildlife reserves and has three visitor centres, including at Montrose Basin in Angus. At long last, wider society has started to waken up to the importance of its purpose to</p><p>&#8220;advance the conservation of Scotland&#8217;s biodiversity for the benefit of present and future generations&#8221;.</p><p>Only one of the trust&#8217;s reserves is located in my constituency. Eighteen months ago, I had the great pleasure of visiting Seaton cliffs in the company of SWT&#8217;s former chief executive officer, Simon Milne, and seeing the wide range of seabirds nesting there. Less enjoyable but just as important was getting a close-up look at the impact of coastal erosion on one side and the negative impact of agricultural practices on the other.</p><p>Elsewhere in Angus, there is the aforementioned Montrose Basin and the front line of the red squirrel project on the Southesk estate. Last year, I was delighted to join the Minister for Environment and Climate Change, Paul Wheelhouse, and my fellow Angus parliamentarian Nigel Don in visiting the estate and meeting Lord Southesk and trust officials to see for ourselves how that hugely important project is being implemented.</p><p>I was struck by the genuine partnership working that the project involves. Scottish Natural Heritage and the Forestry Commission Scotland are involved along with the trust, not to mention the landowning interests all along the battle front who seek to halt the advance of grey squirrels, with all the negative consequences that their presence brings for the iconic red squirrel. Almost as pleasing was hearing of the work that the trust was doing in educating primary school youngsters on the project and the need for it.</p><p>That visit confirmed something that I had picked up through other dealings with the likes of Simon Milne, Jonny Hughes and Maggie Keegan: that the real strength of the SWT is in the people who work for it, with their passion, commitment and, at times, pragmatism.</p><p>I am aware of the number of colleagues who wish to contribute to the debate, so I will conclude. I congratulate John Wilson on securing for us the opportunity to pay tribute to the Scottish Wildlife Trust.

The Common Good Act 1491 was a mere four lines long. Dennis Robertson&#8217;s bill has the clarity in conception, the purity of purpose and the economy of expression that is contained in a mere four lines in the Common Good Act. Of course, the member&#8217;s bill process in this Parliament lends itself to tightly focused and clearly expressed and articulated pieces of legislation. I think that others might usefully learn from that process, which is open to all, even if Sandra White may be one of those who are disappointed.</p><p>The core of the Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill is to improve life for people with some disability that requires them to have help with parking. We need to think in terms of the dignity of the people who have a disability. My experience of that was in the early 1970s when a couple of colleagues who were blind were able, for the very first time, to receive their bank statements in Braille. Up to that point other people had had to read their bank statements to them, and that was a loss of dignity because their confidential information had perforce to be shared with others.</p><p>By the same token, when we ensure that there is adequate parking at the end of what may be an essential journey or a leisure journey&#8212;it is not for us to decide&#8212;and an actual parking place for someone who needs it because they are disabled, we confer upon that person the dignity that we are all entitled to expect. I think that the bill is excellent because it ensures that we share more widely the dignity to which we are all entitled.</p><p>There has been a bit of discussion about the powers of the enforcement officers and the matter of a uniform. In 1968, my summer job as a student was as a water bailiff. I had a warrant card, I could arrest people and I had the untrammelled right of entry into any premises without cause shown, but I had no uniform. That had been the case for water bailiffs for a very long time. Such people can have powers without having a uniform and they can be justly provided, and people were used to the idea that water bailiffs did not have uniforms. The difference in this case, of course, is that enforcement officers will be new. We therefore need to have some tact and diplomacy in the early days in which they operate.</p><p>Quite properly, Inclusion Scotland has focused on the potential for enforcement officers, traffic wardens and policemen to confiscate blue badges unnecessarily and inappropriately. I think that Inclusion Scotland has a valid point. That is why, in the introduction of an enforcement regime that will contribute enormously to people with disabilities, we need to be careful how we do it.</p><p>People who have disabilities do not necessarily see themselves as other parts of society might see them. For example, my mother was 4 foot 10 and a half and she walked with elbow crutches for most of her adult life, but it was different when she got behind the wheel of the Mini Cooper S that she drove. I remember being with her in the car&#8212;before Barbara Castle introduced the universal speed limit&#8212;as she did 100mph down the Baiglie straight.</p><p>Transport can sometimes be transformative; it was for my mother. Let us make sure that in providing parking at the end of the journey&#8212;people should not travel at 100mph as it diminishes the chance of getting there&#8212;we will enhance the lives of certain people and give them the dignity that they deserve.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>Before the minister finishes, will he take an intervention?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>Will the minister inform us a little bit about the enforcement process when badges are validated?

Indeed, when my wife discovers that I have spoken in a debate on culture she will no doubt express considerable astonishment. However, from where we live it is a three-hour round trip to get to the nearest cinema, a three-hour round trip to get to the nearest professional theatre and a two-hour round trip to get to the nearest amateur theatre&#8212;and a very good seasonal offering it is.</p><p>However, that situation does not mean that we do not have culture in my part of the country, because culture is often small scale and local. I was slightly surprised that the culture secretary did not mention in her speech the Linlithgow folk festival, which this year is inadvertently taking place in the week immediately before the referendum, thus restricting some people&#8217;s ability to go to and participate in it. Part of the event next year will be a celebration of Matt McGinn&#8217;s life and contribution to Scottish culture. In Linlithgow, and in communities all round Scotland, we have smaller-scale but very effective and focused festivals that engage a large proportion of local people.</p><p>Rob Gibson talked about the f&#232;isean. I would have said more than I am about to say on this, but the F&#232;isean Bharraigh on Barra and Vatersay has been going since 1981 and it makes a terrific contribution to sustaining Gaelic culture and many instruments that are perhaps not much used in other parts of Scotland. I was a great fan of &#8220;The Tales of Para Handy&#8221; when I was a youngster. I have probably bought that book six, seven, eight or nine times, because I keep giving it away and not getting it back as it is a compelling read. Much of it was written over 100 years ago, but a lot of the political discussions in it still echo today, interestingly. Para Handy&#8217;s instrument of choice was the trump&#8212;the jaw harp&#8212;which the player just sticks in their mouth and flicks away at, and changes the shape of their mouth to make music. Even that is probably beyond my musical abilities, and it is the simplest of all instruments. I have not heard the trump played for a very long time, so perhaps we should have some Government money for that and keep alive Para Handy&#8217;s favourite instrument.</p><p>Rhoda Grant suggested that local festivals cannot compete, but I am not so certain. What I heard was a sort of corporatist view of life that there should be great overarching co-ordination of dates and activities. I take an entirely contrary view and appreciate the anarchy that comes from grass-roots activity and a little bit of survival of the fittest but with some focused financial and organisational support. Platforms such as that which was offered by homecoming 2014 publicise local events&#8212;that is the kind of help that happens. However, by no means should we be interfering in any way, shape or form with that helpful anarchy that comes from a few enthusiastic individuals in communities across Scotland.</p><p>What actually is a festival? It comes from the Latin words &#8220;festum&#8221; and &#8220;festa&#8221;, which just mean &#8220;feast&#8221;. We have not heard much about festivals of food, but in the north-east we have festivals of food, which I very much welcome. Of course, coming from that Latin derivation and being applied across Scotland in many different ways means that a festival can cover almost anything. However, getting co-operation and engagement from across our communities is what sustains our festivals.</p><p>How many festivals do we have in Scotland? The answer is quite interesting. I put the term &#8220;Scottish festivals 2014&#8221; into Google and I got 38.5 million hits. I thought that that might be slightly too many, so I refined it down and the lowest figure that I could get with the most restrictive hit for 2014 was 3,500. There is a lot going on in Scotland.</p><p>Not everyone is a great fan of festivals. Detective Inspector Rebus is the creation of Ian Rankin, and members will know if they have read his books that Rebus drinks in the Oxford Bar in Young Street. That pub used to be owned by a guy called Willie Ross, who was a homophobe, an anglophobe, a misogynist&#8212;he hated almost everybody. He used to shut his pub for the three weeks of the festival and put a notice on the door that said, &#8220;Shut due to festival.&#8221;</p><p>Thankfully, Willie Ross&#8212;who is now deceased, so we can be as rude about him as we want to be and should be&#8212;was the absolute exception. I have a Giles cartoon book from 1948 that includes a cartoon about the fringe; that was the first year that the fringe sputtered into life. The fringe has been around a long time and it very quickly travelled across the world and across public discourse.</p><p>In my constituency the most important festival of all takes place: the Scottish traditional boat festival. It started 21 years ago, when 200 people came to Portsoy, and it now attracts 20,000 people. Occasionally they get good weather.</p><p>We have lots of festivals. I have a huge long list. I suppose that we hope that politicians do not get greatly associated with the Scots fiddle festival&#8212;think about it.</p><p>The whole point about festivals is not about levelling down great international events, but about raising up local aspiration and achievement and preserving local culture.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>:Like Elaine Murray, I am going to be a bit of a parochialist, but I am also going to be an internationalist.</p><p>The people in my constituency earn their living in a variety of ways. Fishing is a long-running industry. Over the years, my constituency has been the site of the biggest whaling port in the world, and people travelled from there to the other end of the world. Today we have Europe&#8217;s biggest whitefish port&#8212;we are significant in the pelagic industries. Many of my constituents work off shore in the oil and gas industry and are getting increasingly involved in the offshore renewables industry. Agriculture is a very significant industry. We deliver the finest beef in the world&#8212;not only to Scotland but beyond, to around the world. We also have significant engineering interests. How are those various interests served by the present arrangements, and could they be better served in an independent Scotland?</p><p>We in Scotland have the longest coastline of any country in Europe. In fact, to give everyone a sense of how long it is, I point out that China&#8217;s coastline is only 50 per cent longer than Scotland&#8217;s. We are essentially a country with extensive and important maritime interests.</p><p>When one has maritime interests, one requires the ability to defend those interests. Do the present arrangements provide for adequate defence? We heard that there are going to be three new small vessels to protect the UK&#8217;s coastal interests. Where are they to be based? Here is a picture of the total number of vessels in the Royal Navy protecting our maritime interests that are based in Scotland.</p><p>That is not just a theoretical debating point. The Kuznetsov, the biggest capital ship in the Russian navy, was built in Odessa in the late 1980s, weighing nearly 60,000 tonnes, with squadrons of Sukhoi Su-27s and Antonov 41s, helicopters, surface-to-air missiles, seven varieties of radar for detecting threats to its integrity and 2,000 sailors on board. In January this year, it was moored so close in off my constituency&#8217;s coast that, even with my eyes, with hypermetropia, myopia, presbyopia, low-light myopia and astigmatism&#8212;only one sight defect to go and I will have the full set&#8212;I could see it. It was legally moored in the Moray Firth, outside the 12-mile limit, but inside our area of economic interest of 200 miles. I could see beyond it&#8212;further out&#8212;the Beatrice oil platform. That is how close in it was&#8212;we could all see it.</p><p>How did the Royal Navy know that the Kuznetsov was there? Well, the Russian sailors have caught up with the modern world and one of them advertised the presence of the Kuznetsov via Twitter. On the case at once&#8212;believe me&#8212;the Ministry of Defence spotted it and dispatched a vessel to protect our maritime interests. In only 38 hours, it got there to see what was going on.</p><p>How would such things have been done better elsewhere? Ireland has eight vessels around its coast. It has just increased the number from seven to eight vessels, and they are distributed around the rather shorter coastline of that smaller, less economically powerful country. Ireland also has a couple of aircraft, which could have gone out and sniffed and hovered over the top and seen what was going on. Our Nimrods are history&#8212;unreplaced. The Kuznetsov is also an aircraft carrier and, as I said, it has aircraft on it, which is slightly different from the UK situation.</p><p>Our other interests include agriculture. Our farmers get the lowest support of any country in Europe, not because money was not provided by the European Union to help farmers in more disadvantaged areas but because the UK Government kept that money, which came to the UK only because of the special circumstances of agriculture in Scotland, where 85 per cent of our land has less favoured area status, while south of the border 15 per cent of the land has less favoured area status. We suffer in agriculture because we are part of the current union. We could do so much better.</p><p>Fishing&#8212;if only I had an hour or two on that subject. We have seen our fishing industry suffer every time the UK represents fishing in Europe, because the priorities of the Scottish fishing industry are not the priorities of the United Kingdom.</p><p>Were we representing ourselves&#8212;even if our own minister occasionally got to speak in Europe&#8212;we would do better. An independent Scotland would certainly do better beyond peradventure.</p><p>We have heard a lot about currency, which is important, but even more important is our economy. The currency is secondary to our economy. If we do not get our economy right and we do not have a Government that represents our economy&#8217;s interests, my constituents will continue to suffer the effects of the United Kingdom.

What better country could we seek to have a relationship with?</p><p>I will pick up on some of the things that Sarah Boyack said about agriculture and highlight some of the great challenges that we in our western developed world are imposing on countries such as Malawi&#8212;and perhaps on Malawi in particular.</p><p>Two thirds of Malawi&#8217;s exports are tobacco. We are rightly seeking to remove tobacco as a major part of our society, for the health of people in our country, and other countries are doing the same. However, when we do that it will have a significant effect on the economy of a country such as Malawi, in which two thirds of exports are tobacco based. We therefore owe a duty to countries such as Malawi to help them cross over to a more beneficial mode of agriculture. They are essentially self-sufficient when it comes to food for themselves, but we are already seeing a danger that tobacco farmers, in the face of reducing profits, move across to grow cannabis. That will not be helpful in the long term for people who are in desperate need in countries such as Malawi.</p><p>Climate change is making agriculture a more formidable challenge in many countries in Africa, and we in the developed world are largely responsible for that. We therefore need to ensure that we support people in Malawi, which we are already doing. We have a number of programmes there that we support.</p><p>I have, of course, said before in the Parliament that climate change in Africa in particular has a gender bias in that it differentially affects women over men, as women are generally the homemakers and the agronomists. While the men sit round the village table discussing the state of world affairs, the women do the actual work. They walk further to get water and get less from the soil for their efforts, as a result of climate change. Therefore, I very much welcome the initiative that the previous Administration took to build effective relationships with Malawi, which continues to be sustained by the current Government.</p><p>We have a number of relationships with Malawi. Hastings Banda, who was born in about 1898, came to Edinburgh to convert his medical qualification to one that was acceptable in the UK. In 1941, the University of Edinburgh awarded him three separate awards. My father, who was studying medicine, knew him; indeed, he was in some of the same classes. I do not necessarily hold up Hastings Banda&#8217;s contribution to Malawi as one of unalloyed success, but he at least started off the country.</p><p>Let us remember that many of the African boundaries were arbitrarily imposed by colonialists, so we share some of the blame in that regard.</p><p>A great thing happening in Malawi is that a sense of adherence to that country&#8212;artificial as it was in its genesis&#8212;is clearly being reflected in public life today.</p><p>A democracy can be tested simply: a democracy exists if a Government allows itself to be removed from office by a ballot of its people. Malawi has passed that fundamental test, which we should much welcome.</p><p>I welcome what both the Opposition parties say in their amendments.

The show complements what the showmen bring, with horses, dancing and a range of competitions, as well as around 250 trade stands and, in the adjacent industrial marquee, more than 1,700 craft displays. The showmen add lustre and excitement to that important event, to which people come from all over the world.</p><p>Thousands of people depend on the entertainment that is provided by the Scottish Showmen&#8217;s Guild. The events aid tourism by dragging people in; they are an important part of our economy.</p><p>I hope that we never forget the showmen&#8217;s contribution, but we should also recognise the challenges that we sometimes create. Let me suggest an example from my personal experience. In 1971, we had decimalisation. The penny in the roll-the-penny stall that I was particularly addicted to became a totty wee coin, but the new 2 pence coin was, of course, five times as valuable. That was a significant challenge and when we were doing decimalisation, nobody thought about it.</p><p>I owe gratitude to my American intern for my remarks.

When it had completed its work on the bill, the Forth Crossing Bill Committee helpfully produced a report that suggested improvements to the hybrid bill process.

At the time, the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee thought that they were sufficiently important to merit review in a couple of years&#8212;a review that the committee has undertaken.</p><p>The main concern that was raised with us by other committees was the very tight timescale for considering potential subsidiarity issues.

There are one or two others of us who may yet speak in this debate.</p><p>It is interesting that we started the debate with a reference to grandparents. I have the misfortunate not to have known any of my grandparents. All my grandparents were born before the first secret ballot in a parliamentary election, which took place on 15 August 1872. When my paternal grandfather was born, Abraham Lincoln was president.</p><p>Many of my generation had less connection with grandparents than others, because we were born immediately after the war to parents who were a bit older, as our dads had been away in the war. We probably experienced less grandparental nurturing than many have.</p><p>Pensions have been around for a long time. When Lloyd George introduced them, they were worth half a crown a week&#8212;I beg his pardon; they were half a crown a month. That was thought to be such a revolutionary and huge financial bonus that, in the book &#8220;Para Handy Tales&#8221;, Para Handy contemplated starting pensioner farms to exploit that money. He would keep a few healthy pensioners on a Scottish island somewhere and make huge profits.</p><p>As I said, pensions have been around for a long time. My great-great-grandfather Andrew Barlow, who was a soldier in the Napoleonic wars, ended up as a Chelsea pensioner, because he went deaf. When my great-great-great-grandfather left the Navy in 1782, he got a pension.</p><p>Only in modern times&#8212;almost within our memory or that of people whom we know&#8212;has the universal pension come along. That is why Gordon Brown&#8217;s intervention to take away some of the tax benefits for pension funds was catastrophic&#8212;that is partly why the private pensions of some people whom I know were wiped out to zero. That happened on the Labour Party&#8217;s watch.</p><p>The Labour Party has done many good things. For example, the anti-smoking legislation in the Parliament took great courage and I absolutely commend it for that. Labour introduced the bus pass scheme, which benefits old people and sustains the bus network in rural areas&#8212;each &#163;1 that is spent on that has two benefits. The Labour Party was behind the introduction of comprehensive education, which I strongly support. In West Lothian, the Labour Party has done many good things, although I remember that it was Jimmy McGinley&#8212;in 1980, I think&#8212;who introduced the Christmas bonus for pensioners, rather than the Labour Party.</p><p>We have been around and we have had quite a lot of good things from the Labour Party, so it is disappointing that there is a perception&#8212;because the prospect has been put into the debate about ideas for change, reduction and containing costs&#8212;of a threat to the benefits that the Labour Party contributed to bringing to Scotland through the operation of the Scottish Parliament. That party has every opportunity to put to one side that perception now or later and say that there is no threat. It could say that those benefits are protected and will be left.</p><p>Are we challenged by the economics of older people? Yes, of course&#8212;there is no country in Europe where that is not the case. However, the reality is that the costs in Scotland are rather less. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said:</p><p>&#8220;Our analysis has shown that the costs of the state pension would be lower in Scotland&#8221;,</p><p>for the bad reason that Scotland has lower life expectancy. We want to drive up life expectancy&#8212;nobody in the Parliament from any political party wants to do anything different. We disagree only about means and timing; we do not disagree about objectives. That is good&#8212;let us try to build on that consensus.</p><p>Social protection costs are lower in Scotland. In 2012-13, those costs were 15.5 per cent of gross domestic product in Scotland, whereas they were half a percentage point higher in the UK, which is 5 or 6 per cent higher. In Scotland, we spent 2 per cent less of our tax revenues than the UK on social protection. Those are all opportunities to provide better care for people who require it.</p><p>Of course, old people do not necessarily require care. There are very many fit older people. If a person starts fit, they can stay fit. I remember watching breakfast television in Australia in the 1980s&#8212;that is very sad, but that is what I did. I saw the guy who had just won the Australian over-40s marathon for the 40th consecutive time. He was in his 90s and was beating people in their 40s. He was fit, he stood proud and upright and his voice was strong, because he had never let himself get unfit at any point in his life.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Older People"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>That is the great trick that Christine Grahame and others have got completely wrong.</p><p>I will draw my speech to a conclusion.</p><p>Neil Findlay described very well the challenge that we face. I thought that he did a fine job. He quoted Peter Johnston, who reinforced that. I agree with Peter Johnston, but the economic challenges that local government, the Scottish Government and communities in Scotland face do not, of course, stem from the Scottish Parliament, which has no control over the macroeconomics of our economy or the substantial majority of the taxation or expenditure that affect our citizens, but from a system that we on the Government benches wish to replace.</p><p>A solution is available. The causes have been identified by Mr Findlay, but he rejects the resolutions. As always, he came from a position of supporting people who need. I respect him for that, but he will earn my greater respect if he understands that there is an opportunity to do things differently in an independent Scotland and that we should take that opportunity and do what he so earnestly desires.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Older People"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>I think that it was about 15 years ago when someone in England completed their pilot&#8217;s licence at the age of 82.

I will reflect on the opportunities that have been brought about by them; touch on the core Commonwealth values of humanity, equality and destiny; and look forward, reflecting on the need to maintain momentum and drive and to build on the strong foundations that are now in place for the benefit of Scotland.</p><p>From the outset, the legacy was central to the planning of the games. With more than 50 national legacy programmes in place, people across Scotland and the Commonwealth are benefiting now. We have reaped the rewards of record levels of investment in Commonwealth games sports with team Scotland&#8217;s highest ever medal haul. It delivered the biggest ever Scottish team, with 310 athletes, and secured a record-breaking 53 medals and four new Commonwealth games records. Such world-class performances, which were supported through a system that was delivered in Scotland, are an inspiration to us all. Scottish Disability Sport and other governing bodies of sport now stand ready for an upsurge in interest and to harness enthusiasm through the unleash your sporty side campaign.</p><p>The working group for sport identified that Scotland has world-class sporting facilities to complement the world-class sporting system, and they are being used by performance athletes and communities alike. They include many facilities that were used in the games, such as the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome, the national indoor sports arena and the Commonwealth pool, but also excellent facilities such as the Aberdeen Sports Village, the regional gymnastics facility in Dundee and many others.</p><p>In fact, since 2007, more than &#163;100 million has been spent on new and upgraded facilities; &#163;25 million has been committed to support the development of the new national performance centre for sport; a further &#163;20 million has been made available through sportscotland&#8217;s national and regional sports facilities fund; more than 100 projects have been supported by the &#163;10 million legacy active places fund; and, just prior to the games, I announced a further &#163;50 million for sportscotland&#8217;s active schools network, which provides pathways between school, club and elite levels. That is not to mention the 133 community sports hubs in development or operational across all 32 local authorities.</p><p>I turn to the economic legacy. Games procurement is estimated to have supported as many as 30,000 jobs. The &#163;500 million that has been spent on the athletes village over the past six years has, on average, supported around 1,000 jobs and contributed &#163;52 million to Scotland&#8217;s economy each year. Through our national legacy programmes, 5,000 events-related training and job opportunities are available across Scotland for those who can most benefit.</p><p>We worked hard to ensure that contracts were accessible. Some 69 per cent went to Scottish businesses and almost &#163;1 million was awarded to supported businesses. Next, we will help companies to take that new confidence and capacity to international markets. With a major international business conference and more than 90 business events held at Scotland house, we engaged more than 1,000 national and international business leaders and helped to strengthen international connections.</p><p>The conversion of the athletes village to housing will leave behind a well-designed residential area where before there was a 90-acre brownfield site. Major transport projects that were completed ahead of the games are helping to open up the area to further development opportunities.</p><p>The legacy is also evident in the events sector, where an additional 37 national and international events worth &#163;14 million have been secured. That bodes well for the sustained use of games infrastructure.</p><p>Alongside the sporting action, the cultural programme involved more than 1,500 events and thousands of performers at venues across Scotland. In Glasgow, more than three quarters of a million people visited the games live zones, which cemented our reputation as a truly creative nation.</p><p>As well as providing an unprecedented opportunity for tourism, the games attracted Commonwealth heads of Government and state, as well as numerous other international dignitaries. Those individuals have taken away a lasting impression of why Scotland is such an attractive place to do business, invest, work, live, study and visit. I have no doubt that the success of the games will continue to be felt throughout Scotland for many years to come.</p><p>I will reflect briefly on the core values of the Commonwealth games, which are humanity, equality and destiny. From the outset, Glasgow 2014 was a truly inclusive games, with para-sport fully integrated and the highest number of medal events ever. Visitors and athletes alike saw at first hand what it is like to be in a country whose Government is committed to an equal and fair society for everyone and has a progressive approach to human rights. The rainbow flag has been flown in solidarity with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people across the Commonwealth, and Pride house welcomed more than 6,000 visitors through its doors. The Scottish Government launched its one Scotland campaign in the middle of the games, promoting the message that Scotland believes in equality. It is vital that the games are a positive force for inclusion not just in the weeks past but for the decades to come.</p><p>Our para-athletes performed fabulously at the games, winning seven para-sport medals, which is why I am delighted to announce &#163;6 million as part of a &#163;9 million investment for the development of a new national para-sports centre. Based in Largs, sportscotland&#8217;s national centre will nurture and hone future sporting talent in Scotland. The centre will complement our network of world-class facilities and will allow for a future Erraid Davies, who amazed us at Tollcross, or Neil Fachie or Aileen McGlynn, who rode to the podium in the velodrome. The centre will be the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. That is testament to the fact that sport can truly be a powerful catalyst for change.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>I should first pay tribute to Kenny Gibson, who has been a real advocate for the Inverclyde centre. He has helped to bring people together to consider the centre&#8217;s future. Sportscotland will work closely with North Ayrshire Council to plan the development of the new centre. As well as the new national para-sports centre, North Ayrshire is keen for its school estate to be involved. That would be a really good balance of use and would give the Inverclyde centre a new lease of life. I am certainly happy to keep the member informed as discussions begin at a more detailed level.</p><p>Looking ahead, I am sure that members will agree that we are well on our way to securing a lasting legacy for Scotland. However, today does not mark the end of legacy&#8212;legacy did not end with the closing ceremony. We have to look ahead to 2018, when the 21st Commonwealth games will take place on the Gold Coast. The eyes of the world will be upon us again, and we will want to show that we have delivered a lasting legacy. I will continue to provide drive and leadership to maximise the benefits of hosting the games, but everyone has a role to play.</p><p>Legacy is the responsibility of many parts of Government. Before the games, I wrote to my colleagues to highlight the important role that they will play in sustaining that legacy in the years ahead. Post-games structures are being established to deliver on our long-term commitments, and we are embedding legacy aspirations into existing policy structures. Achievements to date have been made possible by the partnership working of a host of organisations and committed individuals, all working with a common purpose.</p><p>National partners have been struck by the benefits of a collective approach to legacy&#8212;we achieve more by working together. We will capture the learning from that and use it for legacy and other major events, starting with the year of food and drink next year. Local authorities are an essential link in the chain in spreading the benefits of the games across Scotland. The Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers legacy leads group will meet again soon, and I welcome its continued support.</p><p>There are clear opportunities to strengthen the legacy in a number of areas. On the sporting legacy, sportscotland will continue to drive forward its world-class sporting system, which has already delivered for us so spectacularly. Let us not forget that sportscotland also delivers for schools, communities and sports clubs on a daily basis. An immediate benefit exists in the form of sports equipment from the games. Items such as rugby balls and table tennis tables will be distributed to clubs, schools and local authorities across Scotland.</p><p>A long-term populationwide shift in sports participation and activity levels is not an automatic outcome from hosting a major sporting event. The physical activity implementation plan that was launched earlier this year takes a long-term approach to tackling inactivity, building on the internationally renowned Toronto charter. I look forward to working with partners to ensure that we deliver on our commitment to increase sports participation and physical activity levels, regardless of age or background, as a lasting legacy of the games.</p><p>We are in a good place, but we must keep going. I am pleased to confirm today that we are continuing with &#163;2 million of legacy funding next year to maintain momentum and continue to capitalise on the inspiration that the games have provided.</p><p>There can be no doubt that the games have been a strong catalyst for regeneration in the east end of Glasgow and in South Lanarkshire. However, long-term success will be achieved only if communities are at the heart of regeneration and if the support that was put in place to reduce unemployment before the games is continued and strengthened afterwards.</p><p>In recognising that, the Scottish Government and its partners Glasgow City Council, South Lanarkshire Council and Clyde Gateway have reaffirmed a collective commitment to the regeneration of the area to ensure an enduring legacy. There are also plans in place to work with Scottish businesses to grow Scotland&#8217;s role in the global event sector at home and overseas.</p><p>Events are one of Scotland&#8217;s biggest assets, and we must capitalise on the venues and infrastructure and the business, volunteering and skills bases that have been developed. A new national events strategy will be published after the events of 2014 to capitalise on what we have learned.</p><p>Our 15,000 Clyde-siders have undoubtedly been central to the success of the games. We are working closely with Volunteer Scotland and others on a new initiative that will harness the enthusiasm of those who were successful and those who were not, matching their interests and skills to other exciting volunteering opportunities beyond the games.</p><p>Finally, young people deserve a special mention. They have been at the heart of legacy and are the key to sustaining legacy beyond the games. I, along with 19,000 others, had the pleasure of visiting the youth legacy ambassadors at Glasgow Green, at their flourishing Scotland live site, where seed balls and wishes will form part of a wider regeneration effort to bring stalled spaces back to life.</p><p>I am pleased that Young Scot will, in a matter of weeks, offer young people the platform to co-design future legacy activity beyond this year. It will build on the insights of the 150 youth legacy ambassadors and those of the other young people who are involved in a wide range of legacy programmes that focus on youth, and the year of young people in Scotland in 2018 will provide a pathway to build on the legacy from the games.</p><p>The opening ceremony marked a first by raising &#163;5 million for UNICEF. As a charitable partner of the games, UNICEF will use those funds to realise its ambition of reaching every child in Scotland over the next four years, as well as helping children across the Commonwealth.</p><p>Part of the legacy in Scotland focuses on children&#8217;s rights. I was delighted to receive a preview, along with pupils from Blackfriars primary school in Glasgow, of the child rights launchpad, which will be provided free to schools, community and sports groups and youth clubs throughout Scotland and will, I believe, make a huge difference to children&#8217;s lives.</p><p>The legacy that has been created by the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council and partners is sparking interest further afield. The Commonwealth Games Federation has already hailed it as a &#8220;blueprint&#8221; for the future, which was very complimentary. We are now engaged in learning lessons and transferring knowledge, most directly with our friends in Queensland for the Gold Coast 2018 games, and with the CGF with regard to its plans to build legacy more explicitly into the bid requirements for future games, which we would certainly welcome.</p><p>In the years to come, the 2014 Commonwealth games will be remembered not only as the biggest cultural and sporting event that Scotland has ever seen, but for their legacy, which has grown and evolved to provide other countries with a benchmark to show what can be achieved when we put people, and a nation&#8217;s wellbeing, at the heart of a major international event.</p><p>I note the amendments lodged by Patricia Ferguson and Liz Smith, which I am happy to accept in the spirit of co-operation.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises the many ways in which the Scottish Government and partners have capitalised on the opportunities brought about by hosting the XX Commonwealth Games in Glasgow; acknowledges the excellent partnership working of a whole host of organisations, local, national, public, private and third sector, as well as the many committed individuals who continue to work together to secure a legacy fit for Scotland; welcomes the determination of the Scottish Government and partners to continue to build on these strong foundations, driving forward a legacy based on the core values of the Commonwealth Games, humanity, equality and destiny; looks ahead to 2018, when the next Commonwealth Games will be hosted on the Gold Coast, and reflects on the further commitment and drive required to secure a lasting legacy that Scotland can be rightly proud of.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>It has been great to have complete agreement across the chamber on the success of the games. I thank members for their kind words&#8212;they are very much appreciated.</p><p>I want to respond to as many of the points that have been made as possible, and I will begin by touching on one or two of the points that Patricia Ferguson made.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson was right to say that the community endowment fund has been extremely important in helping athletes to compete. I also agree with her comment that, in the bigger picture of multisport events, the games were probably more affordable than recent comparators. That is important, because if we want countries that have not previously hosted the games to make bids to do so, the costs must be reasonable and the legacy of hosting the games must be visible. As the most recent host, we are keen to tell that story. Although a significant amount of public money has been spent on the games and the infrastructure for them, it has been a good story to tell from the point of view of value of money and the return.</p><p>I point to what we did with Hampden. We did not think that there was a business case for a brand new all-singing, all-dancing athletics stadium, and the engineering solution of converting a football stadium into an athletics stadium was highly cost effective. The fact that that engineering solution is now on the market for other cities to use is extremely important, because in the present difficult financial situation, not just here but across the world, such solutions will be necessary for the future of the games.</p><p>On the issue of volunteers, we provided support for less well-off volunteers, although I recognise that, despite that, a number of people who wanted to take part in the games made many personal sacrifices. John Mason asked about the profile of the volunteers. I can tell him that the Glasgow Centre for Population Health is doing research on the demographic of games volunteers, which will be published in due course.</p><p>Liz Smith talked about the need to make better use of the school estate. We are working hard on that, as I am sure that she is aware. She also mentioned the quality of PE provision, as opposed to just the quantity of it. That is the focus of our most recent investment in PE.</p><p>Another point that Liz Smith made is worth reiterating. We should pay tribute to the BBC, because its presentation of sport was excellent. I am talking about not just its coverage of what happened on the field of play but the wraparound programmes, which made the games accessible. Some of the minority sports that do not often get a high profile had a tremendous opportunity to raise the profile of and sell their sport. I know that the clubs in those sports have been working hard to build capacity in anticipation of an increased level of interest among people of all ages in trying out and taking up those sports.</p><p>Sandra White rightly paid tribute to the other people who made the games a success, such as the bus drivers and the workers in the hotels, the pubs and the clubs, all of whom worked hard to create a friendly atmosphere, which counted for a lot and helped people to enjoy themselves.</p><p>Drew Smith rightly said that we will all miss Kenny Stewart&#8217;s emails&#8212;we will&#8212;and that Glasgow had been gallus and generous in putting on a good show. That is absolutely right. He asked about the prospect of further debates on the legacy of the games. I am happy to give a commitment to hold further debates to monitor the progress that is made, as it is right and proper that we do that.</p><p>John Pentland asked about the social capital of the volunteers. In my statement on Tuesday, I spoke about the sharing of data. We asked the people who applied to be volunteers whether they would be prepared to have their data shared with Volunteer Scotland, regardless of whether they were successful in becoming Clyde-siders. Happily, most of them said that they would be. Volunteer Scotland will now work to signpost those people into local volunteering opportunities in their community. I am sure that we will get a huge boost, not just in sport but in other areas of life, as those volunteers continue the journey that they embarked on at the games.</p><p>James Dornan mentioned the celebration city festival. The community events that went on around the games were important in creating a buzz and reaching out to people who might not be touched by the games in the traditional sense of going along as a spectator or being a volunteer. The work at Cathcart old parish church by the Rev Neil Galbraith was a great example of that. I had the pleasure of visiting the Saturday club there, where the way in which the young people&#8212;some of whom have profound disabilities&#8212;were engaged in trying sports was remarkable and fantastic to witness.</p><p>Tavish Scott was right to mention other Shetlanders&#8212;Lynda Flaws and Andrea Strachan&#8212;who made their mark, as well as Erraid Davies. That shows that we are producing fantastic athletes throughout Scotland. We must ensure that that continues, and we will do that.</p><p>Bob Doris mentioned the opportunities for sport from the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill. I should mention the &#163;1 million legacy 2014 sustainable sport for communities fund, which aims to support communities to realise their ambitions of owning and running their own sports facilities. One of the national legacy projects that we hope to see is sports facilities taking on a new lease of life locally.</p><p>Elaine Murray was right to pay tribute to Louise Martin, as I did in my statement on Tuesday. Louise was instrumental in bringing the games to Scotland. Visionary people such as her saw the potential for Glasgow and Scotland and for sport from hosting the event.</p><p>Marco Biagi talked about the success of Pride house, which gave a voice and a platform to people whose voices are not always heard. The city very much embraced that and a huge number of people visited Pride house. The John Barrowman kiss added to the clear message&#8212;although there was no lecturing&#8212;about where we are coming from on equality. We now have opportunities going forward.

We will not miss that huge opportunity.</p><p>Hanzala Malik was right to pay tribute to parents. Every elite athlete starts their career by being taken to clubs and competitions. The huge sacrifice by parents and families to see someone through from an interest in sport to elite performance cannot be overestimated. It is right and proper to remember the role of parents.</p><p>I will end on Kenny Gibson&#8217;s comments about the para-sports centre. There is a great opportunity for us to add to the fantastic array of national centres and state-of-the-art facilities that we now have in Scotland by adding to it a para-sports centre.</p><p>Let us look at the network of the local 150-plus community sports hubs that will be delivered, the opening up of the school estate and the regional facilities that are providing communities and athletes with really good facilities right through to the state-of-the-art national facilities. If we think back to 10 years ago, we will see that there was very little of that infrastructure then. We now have a picture of sporting infrastructure that is there with the best. What we make of that is important. It is important that we keep using it and ensure that we get the best out of those assets.

I am pleased that the minister responded positively on that issue and I hope that we can encourage her to move even faster.</p><p>As the Law Society of Scotland points out in its briefing for the debate, over the years since 1980 the exercise of the right to buy has reduced the availability of good-quality affordable housing in the public sector. Some 455,000 properties have been taken out of the sector in that period and 500,000 tenants still have a right to buy. More than 185,000 people are on local authority waiting lists, and continuing depletion of the social housing stock is unsustainable in the face of that level of need.</p><p>Of course, abolition of the right to buy is not just about retaining what is left of social housing. It will also remove one of the main constraints on social landlords who seek to expand supply.</p><p>Thanks to this Scottish Government, nearly 31,000 social houses have been completed in the six years to 2013, despite the cuts and austerity imposed by Westminster. I appreciate what Alex Rowley said about the need to go even further, but we need to have the resources available for that purpose. I point out to others that the Scottish Government&#8217;s performance is significantly better than that of its Labour-led predecessor in the previous six years, when the Scottish budget grew in real terms year on year. The contrast is particularly remarkable when it comes to council house building: 4,400 new council houses were built by the Scottish National Party whereas, as Sandra White mentioned, just six were built under the last four years of the Labour-Lib Dem Administration.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-04-24", "body": "<p>As the First Minister is fond of saying, facts are chiels that winna ding.

Examples included excluding young people from multistorey tower blocks that have a large proportion of older tenants with associated support groups and social activities specifically suited to older residents, or limiting allocations to younger age groups in particular areas where there is already a preponderance of young or vulnerable people in order to create a more balanced community.

Moreover, although overt discrimination based on age is unlawful under the Equality Act 2010, that more subtle form of discrimination can and does operate against housing allocation that is entirely fair and based purely on need.</p><p>The committee has identified this as a key issue and has called on the Scottish Government to monitor the application of this provision in practice.

That welcome came not least from long-time campaigners for free school meals such as the Child Poverty Action Group. The Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill is an opportunity for us to make sure that we have a fit-for-purpose legislative foundation for the provision of free school lunches, so that we can deliver on that commitment. The amendments that I propose reach a compromise between the wishes of some to use primary legislation to compel local authorities to honour the First Minister&#8217;s commitment and the desire of ministers to work with COSLA to negotiate implementation of the commitment.</p><p>Amendment 192 has two purposes. First, it gives education authorities the power to provide school lunches free of charge to pupils who satisfy such conditions as the authority thinks fit to choose; and secondly, it imposes a duty on education authorities to provide certain pupils, as prescribed through regulations, with school lunches free of charge.</p><p>The first purpose removes the anomalous duty on education authorities in most circumstances to charge for school lunches. They will be able to choose conditions, as they see fit, in which they will provide free school lunches. It also allows flexibility and is consistent with other legislative provisions on food or drink in schools.</p><p>The second purpose&#8212;the enabling power&#8212;will allow Government to ensure that local authorities provide free school lunches to children in primaries 1 to 3. It goes beyond but complements the existing benefit-centric enabling powers that allow ministers to prescribe what benefits a parent or carer, or a pupil themselves, must receive to be eligible for a free school lunch. It gives ministers the required powers to prescribe circumstances in which a free school lunch must be provided.</p><p>Amendment 201 primarily amends two important duties on education authorities, as introduced by the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007. The first is the duty, set out in section 53A(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, on authorities to take reasonable steps to ensure that every pupil who is entitled to receive school lunches free of charge receives them. The second is the duty, set out in section 53B of the 1980 act, on authorities to take reasonable steps to protect the identity of a pupil who receives school lunches free of charge.</p><p>It is right that those provisions extend to free school lunches that are provided under the changes that are proposed in amendment 192. However, the effect of the amendments may be that free school lunches will be provided to more than those pupils who receive, or whose parents receive, certain benefits. For example, with the implementation of free school lunches for all primary 1 to 3 pupils, the potential stigma that can be associated with free school lunches will not arise. In such cases, it will be neither necessary nor possible to protect the identity of pupils who receive free school lunches, so it would be inappropriate for the duty to continue to apply to education authorities. I therefore propose that ministers have the power to prescribe through regulations the circumstances in which the duty in section 53B of the 1980 act to protect pupils&#8217; identity will not apply.</p><p>I move amendment 192.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-02-19", "body": "<p>There seems to be an outbreak of consensus&#8212;there are repentant sinners everywhere&#8212;so I am quite happy to leave the debate there and urge members to support the amendments.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-02-18", "body": "<p>First, I congratulate Aileen McLeod on securing the debate and express my support for her request for assistance from the cabinet secretary.</p><p>Ms Hyslop might remember that I wrote to her last year on the subject of financial support for the Whithorn Trust and the development of the St Ninian ways pilgrim routes. I was prompted to do so by the aforesaid James Brown, and I pay tribute to him and his wife Susie Cormack Brown for their outstanding development work on the Ayrshire way, which is also known as the Ayrshire pilgrims way and which can be regarded as the first, and perhaps foremost, of those routes.</p><p>Indeed, it was the Browns who first introduced me to the concept of religious tourism and the fact that Scotland is an underexploited market. In 2010, James was the driving force behind celebrations in Scotland to mark the founding of the Burgundy-based Cluniac order 1,100 years ago. The abbeys of Paisley and Crossraguel&#8212;which, for the uninitiated, is just outside Maybole&#8212;are integral components of the Europe-wide network of Cluniac sites, which is a well-established European cultural route in its own right.</p><p>I was honoured to take part in a ceremony at Crossraguel, representing the Scottish Government, along with many visiting guests from Cluny and others from elsewhere in Europe. We were all treated to a historical tableau of medieval times followed by insightful tour of the abbey complex. That experience opened my eyes to the marketing potential of a pilgrims trail, even for a non-religious person such as myself. It also made me wonder why we do not, as a country, make more of our religious heritage.</p><p>It is true that it has been a touchy subject. Post reformation, pilgrimage was outlawed and second offenders even faced execution. Thankfully those days are long past and forgotten now. In June 2011, all our mainstream denominations signed an inter-church declaration in support of pilgrimage and the development or restoration of pilgrim routes.</p><p>There also seems to be a growing appetite for a slower type of tourism combining the physical, such as walking or cycling, with the spiritual and connecting with nature or the past. Perhaps people are trying to define who we are and what our place is in the world.</p><p>To end on a more materialistic note, however, according to VisitScotland walking and cycling tourists spend more than the average holidaymaker, bringing &#163;40 to &#163;60 a day to the local economy, so pilgrim traffic is worth investing in.

How can we possibly choose a winner when we look at the shortlist, which is full of amazing people and inspirational stories? Good luck to everyone on the list, and congratulations to them all.</p><p>I congratulate Jenny Cook on being nominated and then shortlisted for the courage award. As we heard, Jenny is a remarkable young girl who, despite on-going health issues, has dedicated her energy and time to raising significant funds to help others. She has pledged to raise &#163;50,000 and has already raised more than &#163;31,000&#8212;a phenomenal figure for someone so young to raise. Her fundraising directly benefits the lives of other children who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><p>Young people do that kind of thing all the time&#8212;they want to put back into the system something that will help people who have similar stories. The funds that Jenny Cook has raised have been used to provide days out for young people and their families and to support research. That vital support is making a difference to the lives of sufferers now and in the future. It is evident from the debate that we have all been impressed by the dedication of Jenny, who at just 11 years old is making such an impact on the lives of others. Her selfless work is truly inspirational to us all. Jenny also has a fan in the First Minister, who was delighted to meet her at Holyrood earlier this year; she was his guest at the Commonwealth games opening ceremony.</p><p>Jenny&#8217;s sterling work has not gone unnoticed. She is a young ambassador for Yorkhill Children&#8217;s Charity, and she is part of the Yorkhill buddy scheme, helping to support other young people who are frequent patients at the hospital. She is a radio star too, regularly appearing on Radio Clyde&#8217;s Robin Galloway&#8217;s Sunday show. &#8220;Wee Jenny&#8221; now has a high public profile. That has raised the profile of her fundraising activities, which in turn benefits the children who attend Yorkhill children&#8217;s hospital and their families. I do not know how an 11-year-old manages to find the time to do all those things. She is truly a remarkable lady, and someone whom we should very much celebrate. It is good that we have an opportunity to do that in the Parliament.</p><p>What Jenny Cook is doing is, of course, complemented by the work of the Government and my colleague Michael Matheson to try to help sufferers of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn&#8217;s disease and colitis. We should recognise that work, but of course we are here to celebrate the work that Jenny is doing.</p><p>Let me turn to maw&#8217;s mafia. I congratulate Elma Ross, Lynn Morrison, Lesley McGinlay, Connie Smillie and everyone else who is involved on the commitment, tireless effort and dedication that they have shown in establishing and running maw&#8217;s mafia. Their hard work is benefiting many young people with disabilities and learning difficulties in East Kilbride, including their own children.</p><p>The impact of the project cannot be underestimated. The very fact that the family of Stephanie Kelly, an attendee at the project, has nominated maw&#8217;s mafia for a real heroes award is testament to how much the project means to the individuals that attend and their families. It should be recognised as an outstanding model of local communities using their assets to deliver a service that meets the community&#8217;s needs. We should learn from it to address barriers of isolation and loneliness that other young disabled people may be experiencing in other areas of Scotland. With the legislative changes that we have made as part of our reform of public services&#8212;the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Act 2014; the recently passed Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014, which I took through Parliament; and the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013&#8212;we should not lose sight of those young people who need support and who, like every other young person across Scotland, want to have their pals about them and have connections with others.</p><p>The need to address isolation and loneliness was highlighted in the 2010 evaluation of the same as you? campaign, which told us that only one in three people interviewed was able to name at least one close friend. That is why the Scottish Government, in partnership with Equal Futures and other relevant organisations, held a friendship event in January this year to help people with learning disabilities to be supported to have more friends. It is our intention to plan for more such events this year. However, we cannot take our foot off the gas on getting transitions right and ensuring that simple things such as solid relationships are valued.</p><p>Our current strategies to improve the lives of people with learning disabilities and autism and those of their families and carers&#8212;keys to life and the Scottish strategy for autism&#8212;are underpinned by human rights and principles that are based upon dignity, choice and realising potential. Young people with learning disabilities should have opportunities in their communities that enable them to socialise and be part of the community. We know that having an active social life and feeling included helps to improve health and wellbeing for people with learning disabilities and autism. That is why I am delighted to commend maw&#8217;s mafia for giving young people with disabilities and learning difficulties an environment in which they can socialise and enjoy a range of activities and experiences. That work is an embodiment of what we are aiming to achieve.</p><p>As well as supporting young people with disabilities and learning difficulties, the Scottish Government is investing in support for carers like Elma, Lynn, Lesley and Connie at maw&#8217;s mafia to continue to care for their families, friends and neighbours and also to lead a life alongside their caring responsibilities. That is why this Government has committed significant resources of nearly &#163;114 million to supporting carers between 2007 and 2015. We have also invested nearly &#163;14 million in the voluntary sector short breaks fund, which allows carers, young carers and cared-for persons to take a break from their caring responsibilities and gives them an opportunity to relax without feeling stress or guilt. Over &#163;8 million of that investment has gone into supporting children and young people with disabilities and their carers.</p><p>I could not agree more with the speakers today who praised Jenny Cook and maw&#8217;s mafia so highly. With their help and with the help of others like them, the Scottish Government will continue to work towards its aspiration to make Scotland the best place in the world to grow up. However, that can only ever be achieved if we work in partnership and truly value the work of our army of volunteers across every community in our country.</p><p>I wish Jenny Cook, maw&#8217;s mafia, Pat Bannan, Vicki McCarthy, everyone else who has been mentioned and all those who are on the shortlist all the very best at the Scotland&#8217;s real heroes awards ceremony in September. I wish Jenny continued success in her fundraising activities and maw&#8217;s mafia continued success in running the much-valued service in East Kilbride.</p><p>Scotland has a hugely talented army of people doing amazing things for people and creating better lives and life chances for so many, and we should value them. It is a great privilege to be able to conclude this debate for the Government. Again, I thank Linda Fabiani for bringing these two wonderful groups to our attention and for allowing us to celebrate them in an appropriate and highly respectful way.</p><p>13:03 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:30 On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Real Heroes (East Kilbride)"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>Education Scotland monitors the application of GIRFEC through its inspection programme.

I also thank those members who have stayed this evening to show their support for One Parent Families Scotland. I add my welcome to the members of One Parent Families Scotland who are in the gallery. I am pleased and delighted that the organisation has been recognised for its passionate work to develop further its innovative approach to family support through projects such as transforming lives, which was mentioned by Christina McKelvie; the Edinburgh dad&#8217;s club, which was mentioned by Malcolm Chisholm; and the recently launched us together project, which was mentioned by Clare Adamson.</p><p>As a Government, we want to make Scotland the best place in the world to grow up and to allow every child the opportunities to flourish. We want to be a more child-friendly country and to have a culture that supports all parents and carers and values their role, whatever shape their families take. Organisations such as One Parent Families Scotland are helping us to achieve that ambition.</p><p>I am pleased and proud to recognise One Parent Families Scotland&#8217;s work. During my time as a minister, I have really enjoyed getting to know the organisation a bit better. I have seen its work through visits to Falkirk. Recently, I attended a conference where the speakers who absolutely stole the show were the young mums who spoke passionately about what they want to do, their aspirations for their children and the support that they have received from One Parent Families Scotland. Like Christina McKelvie, I found those individuals&#8217; stories to be inspiring. They showed the tangible difference that the organisation makes to individual lives and families, too.</p><p>I pay particular thanks to One Parent Families Scotland because it also sits on a number of Government boards and groups and provides valuable input into our work and policy development, particularly on the ministerial advisory group for child poverty.</p><p>As we have heard this evening, One Parent Families Scotland does a number of wonderful things in key areas that make a real difference to the lives of lone parents and their families. One such area is the support that it provides to lone parents to get into employment. As many members have said, employment is a gateway that serves as the means to provide for our families. However, for some lone parents finding suitable, flexible and well-paid work can be a real challenge. Malcolm Chisholm pointed out that complexity in his contribution.</p><p>The integrated package of support that is provided by One Parent Families Scotland gives lone parents the training, information and advice that they need to make informed choices on how, where and when they work. The Scottish Government recognises the important role that flexible working plays in helping lone parents to manage the twin responsibilities of work and parenting. In order to help all parents to thrive at home and at work, we are funding a collaboration with Fathers Network Scotland, Parenting across Scotland and Working Families to try to change the way in which Scotland&#8217;s parents live and work.</p><p>We are working with employers to support them in creating workplaces that encourage a better work-life balance for everyone. That is of particular relevance to Christian Allard&#8217;s contribution, because it has a particular focus on fathers. I appreciate the candidness with which Christian Allard spoke of his experience as a single father and acknowledge the particular interest that he takes, through the work of the Equal Opportunities Committee, in ensuring that we do more to support fathers to contribute to the lives of their children.</p><p>As members have pointed out this evening, there is no such thing as a nuclear family any more. In 2011, there were 236,000 lone-parent households in Scotland, which equates to 11 per cent of all households in our country. It is clear that families come in all shapes and sizes and that many will need to juggle multiple responsibilities. High-quality, flexible childcare that parents can afford, as well as family-friendly working practices, are crucial to Scotland&#8217;s families&#8212;whatever form those families take.</p><p>I particularly applaud the childcare services that One Parent Families Scotland provides across the country, be that its home-based service, its mobile cr&#232;che or its personalised care for children with additional needs. The provision of such flexible support is vital for Scotland&#8217;s families, which is why, as a Government, we are building on our previous increase in annually funded early learning and childcare provision from 412.5 hours to 475 hours in 2007 with the further expansion to 600 hours from this August. That represents a 45 per cent increase in provision in places for three and four-year-olds since this Government came to office and is worth up to &#163;707 per child, per year.</p><p>That further embeds flexibility, which I know is important to families across Scotland, particularly one-parent families. It is important to recognise that such policy developments often take meaningful contributions from parents themselves, and I know that One Parent Families Scotland has fed into the development of our childcare policy.</p><p>The type of support that One Parent Families Scotland provides across Scotland does not just stop at employability and childcare. The specialised service that it offers to parents to help to ensure that children are given the best possible chances in life is also worthy of note. Support for parents is absolutely key to improving outcomes for our children. We want to build the knowledge, skills and confidence of all parents so that they can be, and do, the best that they can for their kids.</p><p>Parenting skills, advocacy, mentoring, signposting and support groups are provided by One Parent Families Scotland to help parents to overcome barriers and take positive steps towards their family&#8217;s future. Innovative projects such as transforming lives are invaluable and can nurture and encourage lone parents to form new relationships, friendships and networks of support.</p><p>The national parenting strategy, which was launched 18 months ago, is for all of Scotland&#8217;s parents. It acknowledges that, as Christina McKelvie noted, being a mum or a dad is one of the hardest and most important jobs that anyone can take on. When we come back from the maternity unit, we do not get a handbook with that wee bundle of joy, though it could be very useful.</p><p>The challenges are even greater for families in difficult situations. Almost one in four children now lives in lone-parent households, and that figure is projected to rise further in future. We want to be certain that the right support and services exist to meet the particular needs of lone-parent families. We also want to be certain that no parent or family ever feels isolated. We want to ensure that they can access information, advice and support whenever they need it most. With an investment of &#163;18 million, we are in the process of doing that by promoting access to, and participation in, a comprehensive range of activities and services, and by making the best use of all the resources available in order to improve community wellbeing.</p><p>We want parents to recognise their strength and be all they can be, which is why transforming lives is so good&#8212;it is about revealing to parents the skills that they have. The term that is used so often to describe that approach is an &#8220;asset-based approach&#8221;, and I really like the way in which our former chief medical officer, Sir Harry Burns, described it as moving people from being &#8220;passive recipients of services&#8221; towards being</p><p>&#8220;active agents in their own lives.&#8221;</p><p>That is good for parents and particularly good for children, who will go on to be the parents of the future.</p><p>One Parent Families Scotland offers single parents help to develop strong relationships. We have heard about those who work in transforming lives, particularly Margaret McTaggart, who clearly goes above and beyond the call of duty, and shows just how passionate she is to help the parents in her care&#8212;Christina McKelvie and Liz Smith both made that point.</p><p>I thank Christina McKelvie and the others who contributed to the debate. I also warmly thank One Parent Families Scotland for its commitment to children and parents across Scotland, and I wish it every success for the future. Challenges remain: welfare reforms and tackling poverty pose significant challenges not only to our work in Government but to the work that is done by One Parent Families Scotland and other organisations like it across the country. We will continue to work together in partnership, using the powers that we have, to ensure that children get the very best start in life and that all parents are respected and valued for the very important role that they fulfil.

It is worth reminding ourselves of just what those achievements are.</p><p>We are building on our previous increase in annually funded early learning and childcare provision, from 412.5 hours to 475 hours in 2007, with a further expansion to 600 hours from this August. That represents a 45 per cent increase in provision for three and four-year-olds since the Government came to office and is worth up to &#163;700 per child per year.</p><p>We are working with local authorities and partner providers to deliver a phased, sustainable expansion of early learning and childcare that supports more children and families while maintaining quality and&#8212;for the first time in legislation&#8212;improving the flexibility of provision in line with local needs. We are backing that up with investment by committing more than &#163;250 million over the next two years, including &#163;3.5 million to strengthen the capacity and skills of staff, alongside the on-going expert review of the early years workforce.</p><p>We have done all those things because they are the right thing to do. Investment in our children&#8217;s lives, in the earliest years, is crucial for the future of our country. Childcare enhances all-round development and wellbeing in children. Evidence also shows that childcare is particularly beneficial for disadvantaged children. The benefits of childcare persist through primary school, with evidence also suggesting that they carry on into secondary school and beyond.</p><p>Our commitment to children is evident in our world-leading early years policies and strategies, including our ground-breaking early years collaborative. We promote the measures that we do because they advance our economy and our society. Because we know what works and how important it is, we continue to be hugely ambitious. However, our ambition absolutely requires independence.</p><p>In &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221;, we outlined our blueprint for achieving universal childcare in Scotland. Kezia Dugdale outlined our plans, but they are so good that further expansion is required. In our first budget, we will commit &#163;100 million to extend 600 hours of childcare to nearly half of Scotland&#8217;s two-year-olds. By the end of that first session of Parliament, those vulnerable two-year-olds and all three and four-year-olds will be entitled to 1,140 hours of childcare, which is broadly the same number of hours as is provided in primary school. To achieve that, we will invest a further &#163;600 million.</p><p>In the long term, we will provide 1,140 hours to all children in Scotland, from the age of one to when they start school. When that is fully implemented, around 240,000 children and 212,000 families will benefit.</p><p>The transformational change of our childcare policy would improve care and learning for young children, boost economic growth and remove a major barrier to work for many parents, especially women. Indeed, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Union have stressed the importance of childcare in removing barriers to female labour market participation.

The European Commission, the OECD and various experts all agree on that. A European Commission report from 2009, based on a study of 30 countries, concluded:</p><p>&#8220;Empirical studies of the relationship between childcare costs and labour force participation are consistent with this prediction; when costs go down, labour force participation goes up, especially among mothers.&#8221;</p><p>The SPICe briefing, which was published on 3 April, states:</p><p>&#8220;there are currently 64,000 economically inactive women in Scotland with children aged 1-5. The second and third of the Scottish Government&#8217;s modelled scenarios require 68,000 and 104,000 inactive women to enter the workforce.&#8221;</p><p>However, the next sentence on page 26 states:</p><p>&#8220;In order to achieve the modelled scenarios, the policy would need to influence the labour market decisions of a larger group of women, which could include:</p><p>women who do not currently have children or who have children aged under 1 year or over 5 years, and</p><p>future groups of women, either before or when they have children (which could extend the timescale of the impact)&#8221;.</p><p>In other words, SPICe recognises that the policy operates over more than one year and that women who re-enter the labour market as a result of free childcare stay in the labour market even when their children get older. Without the help that we propose, too many never come back into the labour market.</p><p>That point is made in the Scottish Government analysis that was published on 12 January, which noted:</p><p>&#8220;Such an expansion is modelled to take place over a number of years. However, the impacts of such a policy on output and taxation will build over time.&#8221;</p><p>SPICe, of course, recognises that, every year, around 55,000 children are born in Scotland. Their mothers will benefit year on year.</p><p>I turn to the points that Kezia Dugdale raised this morning in her press release about our proposals. For her and her party&#8217;s information, I point to the robust evidence and analysis on which our childcare policy is premised: the growing up in Scotland research and an international review of early learning and childcare policy, delivery and funding. In addition, our policy takes account of the OECD&#8217;s starting strong work, which highlights the best type of childcare system, and the effective provision of pre-school, primary and secondary education study.</p><p>In contrast, let us examine Labour&#8217;s recent performance on childcare. At the start of this year, Kezia Dugdale and her leader&#8212;who is in the chamber this afternoon&#8212;commenting on their spending preferences for the consequentials, said that they would invest in childcare to help 10,000 vulnerable children. Despite us pledging to help more than 15,000 children from August next year, Labour voted against those proposals.</p><p>On &#8220;Scotland Tonight&#8221; on 7 January, when challenged to say what she would cut to pay for her childcare pledges, Kezia Dugdale suggested removing funding from small businesses. The next day, her party colleague Patricia Ferguson confirmed on &#8220;Politics Scotland&#8221; that Labour would &#8220;certainly consider that&#8221;. However, when John Swinney said on 23 January, on &#8220;Question Time&#8221;,</p><p>&#8220;Kezia wanted us to increase business rates for companies within Scotland&#8221;</p><p>she protested:</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true.

Given what Ms Dugdale said this morning about not creating policy on the back of a fag packet, members can imagine my surprise and astonishment to read SPICe&#8217;s conclusions on Labour&#8217;s policy proposals:</p><p>&#8220;Labour party researchers have indicated that they are still in the process of deciding the policy details and funding&#8221;.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale rose&#8212;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-05-28", "body": "<p>I did not realise that the fag packet to which Kezia Dugdale referred this morning was about her own party&#8217;s policies.

However, it would be wrong to be complacent about the figures, and searching questions need to be asked about the detail. How many of those women are on zero-hours contracts? How many are underemployed? How many are on the minimum wage? How many are self-employed but are unable to make a living from what they earn? As recently as yesterday morning, a discussion on BBC Radio Scotland&#8217;s &#8220;Morning Call&#8221; centred on the statistic that the average woman in Scotland will have to work 14 years longer than the average man to earn the same across her working lifetime.</p><p>It is wrong&#8212;and, I think, naive&#8212;to imply that the barriers faced by women with regard to equality of opportunity are somehow the fault of Westminster and that they can be solved only by voting for Scotland to leave the UK.</p><p>Barriers such as gender segregation, whereby women are stereotypically found&#8212;as my colleague Rhoda Grant illustrated&#8212;in low-paid, so-called female occupations, and their underrepresentation in boardrooms or in senior management positions are not just a matter of constitutional responsibility; nor are the additional responsibilities that women tend to face that can interfere with their employment prospects, such as the likelihood that they will have primary caring responsibilities for children not just outwith the time that they are in nursery or at school, but when they are ill, and the fact that women are more likely to have to care for sick or elderly relatives.</p><p>Those barriers do not exist simply because the UK Government has failed to legislate. Jenny Marra described the genesis of the Equal Pay Act 1970. It was superseded by the Equality Act 2010, and the current UK Government, which I do not often have anything good to say about, included the sharing of parental leave and the right to request flexible working in the Children and Families Act 2014.</p><p>It may be that the legislation is not yet tough enough. Engender, which Mary Scanlon mentioned in her speech, noted that, over the past 20 years, UK Governments have advocated encouraging private employers to adopt best practice rather than requiring them to take action. Perhaps we need to be a bit tougher, and I would like the cabinet secretary to tell us whether, in the event of independence, the Scottish Government would take a statutory approach.</p><p>One of the contributors to yesterday&#8217;s &#8220;Morning Call&#8221; was a 27-year-old woman who argued that sexism was worse today than it had ever been. As someone who is considerably older, I would not agree&#8212;I think that sexism was even worse when I was young&#8212;but we have not made the strides that I would have thought that we might have been able to make over the past 60 years. After all, 100 years ago, women did not even have the vote and had no right to employment after marriage. The fact that we still have a fair way to go is disappointing, but I agree with those who have said that society&#8217;s attitudes to women are what matter, not who legislates and where. The issue is much deeper and more fundamental than that.</p><p>That is demonstrated in the report on women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, &#8220;Tapping all our Talents&#8221;, which was commissioned by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2012 and chaired by the eminent astrophysicist Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell. That report advises that there are 56,000 female graduates in STEM subjects of working age in Scotland&#8212;including me&#8212;but only 27 per cent of them are using their qualifications to work in STEM subjects, compared with 52 per cent of male graduates in those subjects. In 2009, some 11,000 female graduates in STEM subjects of working age in Scotland were unemployed or economically inactive. What a waste of talent&#8212;and of expensive training, because it is not cheap to educate people in the STEM subjects. If the cabinet secretary has more up-to-date information&#8212;that figure dates from five years ago&#8212;I would be interested to learn whether any progress has been made in reducing it.</p><p>The report also demonstrated&#8212;this parallels what Rhoda Grant said&#8212;that the further up the ladder in STEM subjects one looked, the less represented women were. At the top levels&#8212;I am talking about professors and heads of research institutes&#8212;women were even less represented.</p><p>The report made a number of recommendations for the Scottish Government, and I wonder whether the cabinet secretary could update us on those to which she has not already referred. At a meeting in April 2013, Shona Robison appeared to want to take on board the report&#8217;s recommendations, and I would like to know what progress is being made on that. One of them was that there should be a national strategy for Scotland to address occupational segregation and, in particular, its impact on the STEM subjects. Another was on the use of procurement to ensure that contractors and suppliers met the public sector equality duty. I do not think that we quite did that in the recent legislation on procurement.</p><p>The cabinet secretary mentioned the introduction of statutory pay audits, which the report recommended. The report also wanted public bodies and agencies to be required to produce plans to close the gender pay gap within an agreed timescale, and it wanted more gender disaggregated data to be produced. It called for adequate resourcing for initiatives that had demonstrated success in tackling occupational segregation, and it wanted all Scottish universities to be required to bring their STEM departments up to the Athena scientific women&#8217;s academic network silver standard within two years. It advocated the introduction of legislation similar to the legislation that was introduced in Spain in 2011 on gender balance, and it wanted universities and research institutions to be required to adopt a gender equality plan and the integration of gender issues into the curriculum.</p><p>All those recommendations could be taken forward now with the powers that the Government already has, so I hope that, when we return to Parliament after the referendum is over, the Government will show a determination not to blame others for the barriers that women in Scotland still face in employment, but to press ahead with the actions that we can take here and now to remove those barriers with our existing powers and with the further powers that will indubitably be devolved to the Parliament in the future. I look forward to the further devolution of those powers.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>As others have said, the major festivals, such as those that are taking place in Edinburgh, are world famous and attract visitors from across the globe, contributing many millions to the national economy. However, like others, I point out that it is not just on the international stage where festivals make a valuable contribution, and I want to highlight the contribution that regional festivals make to their local communities. Unsurprisingly, I will do that with reference to my constituency, as Dumfries and Galloway boasts a wide range of popular festivals throughout the year, many of which have been in existence for quite a bit longer than the Edinburgh festival. It will not be an exhaustive list, so I apologise to any festivals that I have omitted&#8212;this is a sample.</p><p>The first festival of the year is only three years old but it has been remarkably successful in that short period. The Big Burns festival, a contemporary festival that includes events such as a burlesque Burns supper, takes place over the weekend nearest Burns night. Last year, it attracted 14,000 visitors, 15 per cent of whom came from outwith Dumfries and Galloway. As a consequence, plans are under way to extend the festival over nine days next year. The festival also involves a large outdoor arts celebration, which is quite unusual at that time of year, so we always have our fingers crossed that the weather will not be too bad.</p><p>Wildlife tourism is valuable to the region and is encouraged by the Wild Spring festival in April and May. This year, it involved around 100 wildlife events, featuring several iconic species that are native to Dumfries and Galloway such as red squirrels, barnacle geese, otters and red kites. The Spring Fling is a visual arts and crafts festival that takes place in May and, in the same month, the Dumfries and Galloway arts festival is a celebration of the performing arts in venues large and small across the region.</p><p>People interested in recreational tourism are attracted by a number of walking festivals, including those in lower Annandale, Moffat, Langholm, and upper Nithsdale. The region also hosts a number of music festivals. Famously, there is the Wickerman in Galloway, but there is also the Eden festival at Raehills in Annandale in June and, just last weekend, we had Youth Beatz, a free music festival for young people in the region that is presented by Dumfries and Galloway Council and Youth Work Nithsdale. There are jazz festivals in Kirkcudbright in June and in Lockerbie in September, the latter of which was spectacularly headlined by Ruby Turner last year, and I am looking forward to finding out who is coming this year. Moffat incorporates a traditional music festival into its programme for the annual gala and the little village of Moniaive, which has a population of only 487, hosts not one but two annual music festivals&#8212;a folk festival in May and the Michaelmas Bluegrass Festival in September.</p><p>I think that I am the only representative of the debatable lands who is taking part in the debate, so I must mention the galas, common ridings and ridings of the marches that are celebrations of the culture and history of the south of Scotland. Virtually every village has its own gala, and the larger communities of Lockerbie, Dumfries, Annan, Langholm and Sanquhar have common ridings or ridings of the marches followed by galas and parades, which regularly attract between 100 and 200 horses and riders. All of them are beautifully turned out, but even more attention is probably paid to the appearance of the horses than is paid to that of the riders. It can take many hours to get a horse ready for a riding of the marches.</p><p>Most of the galas date from the early 20th century&#8212;Langholm&#8217;s is older; it started in 1759&#8212;but their origins go back centuries to the border reivers of the 13th and 14th centuries. In those times, the marches were ridden to check that no neighbouring clan from either side of the border had made off with the town&#8217;s sheep or cattle, or purloined some of its territory.</p><p>Some argue that the origins of the common ridings date back even further than that and lie in the Celtic summer festivals that Liz Smith mentioned, which involved horse racing and horse trading. Langholm common riding attracts former residents, who return year after year to stand in Kirk Wynd to witness the horses&#8212;this year, I think that there were 174 of them&#8212;gallop past at full pelt; I am surprised that no health and safety person has found out about that. They also witness the crying of the fair three times, which involves a man standing on the back of a horse shouting while surrounded by the entire population of the town and the surrounding area. On one occasion, the horse&#8212;it was a new horse&#8212;took some exception to the proceedings and it looked as if the man would be put off, but he managed to cry the fair before the horse bolted. In most places, people would have been frightened but, as it was Langholm, people just stood back, let the horse bolt through and came back together again.</p><p>Annan combines its gala and riding of the marches with a pipe band competition, which culminates in a performance by the massed pipe bands in the town&#8217;s high street. I would defy anyone who listens to the performance of &#8220;Highland Cathedral&#8221; by the massed pipe bands in Annan High Street not to feel the hairs on the back of their neck stand up.</p><p>Moffat, with its history as a market town in the wool trade, prefers to celebrate the sheep rather than the horse. The shepherd and his lass are installed the evening before the gala, when the shepherd&#8217;s ball takes place. Moffat also holds an annual sheep race, which will take place this Sunday. That is quite an event, too.</p><p>There are festivals to suit all ages and interests, but one aspect that they all have in common, as others have mentioned, is that they would not happen were it not for the volunteers&#8212;it is often the same people who volunteer year after year&#8212;who put in a huge amount of time and effort. One of the local councillors tells me that, in Langholm, the planning for next year&#8217;s common riding started the day after this year&#8217;s common riding.</p><p>Those regional and local events do not generate the income to allow people to be employed to apply for grants, to fill in the necessary notifications or to engage participants and performers. It is ordinary volunteers who have to do all that work, which can be pretty onerous. As I said, the work of organising the next year&#8217;s event often starts as soon as that year&#8217;s event has taken place.</p><p>The festivals do more than provide activity, enjoyment and celebration, and they do more than attract visitors and contribute to the local economy. They promote a sense of community identity and contribute to the wellbeing and cohesion of the community. In fact, I think that the work that is done for the festivals helps communities to survive some of the bad times that can come along. We have seen that in Dumfries and Galloway. Today&#8217;s debate is a good opportunity to pay tribute to and thank all those people who work so hard to make such events happen. I thank everyone in Dumfriesshire who contributes to our wonderful array of festivals.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>Nobody here has been arguing that Scotland could not be an independent country.

My constituents use Carlisle for leisure, shopping, access to the rail network and work. There is a whole barrage of reasons why people do not want to be separated from Carlisle. People who live in the east of my constituency access medical services in Carlisle. Some businesses in Gretna, for example, operate on both sides of the border. Many of the tourists who visit Dumfries and Galloway come from northern England and the Midlands, and those areas are targeted in local tourism campaigns because they are such a strong source of visitors. It is hardly surprising therefore that the links across the border are so important to my constituents, and they are why I believe that a substantial majority of my constituents will vote no on 18 September. There is no way that those links would be improved under independence.</p><p>Devolution, however, offers further opportunities. Members might not be aware of the UK House of Commons Communities and Local Government Select Committee, which last month published an interesting paper on the potential for devolution in England, and specifically on fiscal devolution, with additional tax-varying and spending powers given to cities and the city regions that have been created through local authorities working together. Some limited examples are already functioning through the city deal, but what the select committee is proposing goes much further.</p><p>The select committee is composed of Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs, and those MPs are urging the implementation of their proposals during the next Westminster parliamentary session, starting next year. I hope that their parties are listening.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I wish I had not taken than intervention; it was just a diversion from what I am trying to argue for my constituents.</p><p>I know that MSPs such as Kenneth Gibson think that what is happening in England is completely irrelevant, but it could be extremely important to the south of Scotland as long as we remain part of the United Kingdom.</p><p>Additional power is already being devolved to Scotland in 2016, as we all know, and all three main UK parties have agreed that further powers will be devolved.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>No I will not; the previous one went on for far too long.</p><p>There are differences between the parties&#8217; proposals, as expected, but power should not be transferred from Westminster to consolidate power in Holyrood. The SNP Government does not seem to understand that. We, too, should be considering how powers can be further devolved more locally. It is in such devolution of more power that there is an opportunity for Dumfries and Galloway to work with the authorities in Carlisle and Cumbria to develop the regional economy. I consider that to be a huge opportunity for the Solway basin, but it cannot happen if both sides are in separate countries. Even if there was no physical border, that sort of collaboration could not take place.</p><p>We know that one of the consequences of devolution in the south of Scotland is that cross-border working has not taken place to the same extent that it did prior to 1999. That cross-border co-operation needs to be reinstated if we are to take forward the city of Carlisle region, which Dumfries and Galloway is part of. Devolution on both sides of the border would offer that opportunity, but separation will not&#8212;it will kill it stone dead. If we have separation, Dumfries and Galloway will remain a forgotten corner of Scotland, cut off from Carlisle and with no strong links to any Scottish city.</p><p>As I have said on several occasions, if the people of Scotland vote yes, I will respect that decision&#8212;and I will. However, I will have serious reservations about the effects on my constituents. I genuinely cannot see how separating from the rest of the United Kingdom, and Carlisle and Cumbria in particular, can be of any economic benefit to Dumfriesshire. I make no apology for being parochial in my contribution because I was elected to represent the interests of my constituents, and it is my firm belief that separation from our closest neighbours in Carlisle and Cumbria cannot be in their interests. That is the reason why my constituents will vote a resounding no on 18 September.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>Many years ago, in the first session of Parliament, I had the good fortune to have the post of Deputy Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. It is fairly obvious from that title that I had some pretty good gigs. There was the Cannes film festival, the Edinburgh film festival, Scottish Opera and various other things, but I probably enjoyed most of all being involved with the Scotland team in Manchester in 2002.</p><p>I had known Manchester a bit because, back in the 1980s, I was involved in a research project with a scientist at the Christie hospital and I had worked there from time to time. At that time, Manchester was a city with great cultural, industrial and political traditions, but it had fallen on hard times to a certain extent. When I went back to Manchester in 2002, I barely recognised the city, as it had changed so much. The changes in its appearance, atmosphere and confidence were very marked.</p><p>Two events were credited with that change. Obviously, one was terrible: the Provisional IRA bombing in 1996. The other event that was associated with the regeneration was the Commonwealth games. To many of us who attended with the Scottish team at that time, the parallel with Glasgow was striking, and the seed was planted to bring the games to Glasgow in 2014.</p><p>When I was watching the games on television, I was particularly pleased to see Louise Martin presenting some of the prizes, as she was a mainstay of the Scottish team and the Commonwealth games, and she was crucial to bringing them to Glasgow. She has to take a great deal of the credit for the success of the games this year. I also congratulate everybody else: all the politicians and everybody else who worked hard to bring the games here and all the people who made them such a tremendous success.</p><p>Some of the legacy of the games is already in place, of course. It gives me some amusement to remember that, when I was in Manchester, I was lobbied by one Chris Hoy on the need for a competition-standard velodrome in Scotland. We now have a state-of-the-art velodrome in Scotland, and it is named after him. From what I knew of Chris Hoy, I am sure that he was far too modest to imagine that it would ever be named after him.</p><p>The games were, of course, a tremendously wonderful experience. This time last week, I was on the bus from Eurocentral to Hampden to see Eilidh Child powering to her silver medal, David Weir, who is an extraordinary sportsman, being cheered on to his success in the T54 1,500m by Scots as much as by English people, and Amos beating Rudisha. I was also there on Saturday. I do not know whether I saw Usain Bolt, as he went so fast that he was a blur, but I saw him afterwards. Whether I caught him racing is another thing. That was a marvellous experience.</p><p>The overall success of the games in years to come will be judged by what changes for the better they effected in Glasgow and the rest of Scotland. Over the years, as we saw with Manchester, memories of the games will eventually fade, even though they are great memories for all of us who were involved. Games will be held in other nations, and their games will be talked about.</p><p>I have no doubt that the games will inspire more young people to take up sport and become involved in sports that they would otherwise not have considered. Talented young athletes will be able to train in top-class facilities in Scotland, although some of that training will still go on in other parts of the United Kingdom. In some parts of Scotland, members of the public will also have access to the tremendous venues. A new generation of elite athletes will have gained inspiration from what they have seen during the past couple of weeks in Glasgow.</p><p>I want to return to what I touched on in a question earlier this week. What about most of us who do not possess any great talent for sport? Will we become more active and sustain that activity over future years? I do not think that we should expect elite sport to deliver that. Apart from anything else, the physiques and performances of elite athletes are so different from those of most of us that, although we love watching them, we do not identify with them, because we know that we will never be like that.</p><p>Getting more people more active more often has been an aspiration since the review of the sport 21 strategy in 2003, which I took part in, and I am sure that it probably was an aspiration before that. That aspiration has been difficult to achieve over the years. I wonder whether that is in part because achieving it is presumed to be a side effect of success in elite sport. Unfortunately, getting ordinary people more active more often cannot be delivered in a top-down way. Even if we delivered first-class facilities across the country, we could not ensure that people who do not take part in physical activity will take it up.</p><p>I think that the vast majority of ordinary people will be encouraged to be more physically active if they see people like them taking part in physical activities that they enjoy. That is where friends, colleagues and family members can help one another to improve their physical fitness. Most people who have a degree of physical capability will be able to find some form of exercise that they enjoy, whether it is swimming, cycling, jogging or walking, and they can set themselves personal goals to go a bit faster or further or to carry on a bit longer.</p><p>It is not always easy to maintain physical activity once started. People who have a busy lifestyle need something that fits in. For me, one of the attractions of walking is that I can fit it in with my job, although I have to say that I would not power walk up to anybody&#8217;s door and demand to know how they voted. In Scotland, outdoor activity is great at this time of the year, but less so when the sun does not rise until almost 9 and sets again before 4. Therefore, there needs to be long-term motivation once the novelty wears off.</p><p>There are three aspects to that. First, there needs to be more publicity about individuals improving their fitness through normal physical activity. We hear a lot about people on diets and we see lots of programmes about people losing weight, but we do not hear a lot about people becoming more physically active. We need to have more concentration on that. The second part is encouragement and support from others and taking part in the community. Finally, there is the personal motivation to improve. It is not only elite athletes who achieve personal bests&#8212;any one of us, whatever our age and build and if we have some degree of physical capability, can choose an activity and be the best that we can be.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>The Commonwealth games were a fantastic success and I am sure that they will inspire young people to get involved and produce future generations of elite athletes.

The only thing that he still finds difficult is the British winter weather.</p><p>In advance of the debate, I read through the contributions of Lord Roberts and Baroness Lister to the debate on the Immigration Bill in the House of Lords on 17 March, and I had great sympathy with some of the points that they made. For example, Baroness Lister argued that the time limit debarring asylum seekers from accessing the labour market should be reduced from 12 to six months&#8212;she did not say that it would go altogether&#8212;in order to reduce the danger of asylum seekers being forced into the illegal shadow labour market and being subject to totally unregulated exploitation and exposure to criminal elements involving trafficking and other horrendous abuses. She also pointed out that the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on its inquiry into the treatment of asylum seekers considered that, in a number of cases, their treatment breached the threshold in article 3 of the European convention on human rights for inhuman and degrading treatment. The report stated that the policy of enforced destitution should cease, that the system of asylum seeker support was a confusing mess and that a coherent, unified, simplified and accessible system of support for asylum seekers should be introduced. That ought to have happened but it has not.</p><p>Yesterday, Jack McConnell argued that the UK could have a regionally flexible immigration policy that would recognise that the issues are different in different parts of the country. We know that he piloted a form of that when he was First Minister, through the fresh talent initiative.

That worries me. We need to look more widely at the issue. Political instability, war, climate change and natural disasters are forcing people out of their own lands across the globe, and I think that we need an international response to the issue of asylum seekers, rather than having a response as a small nation.</p><p>I want to touch on public attitudes to asylum and immigration. Sometimes, we are a little complacent about views in Scotland. I was shocked when more than 13 per cent of the voters in Dumfries and Galloway voted for UKIP. I believe that the average UKIP vote across the south of Scotland was 11 per cent. If that were replicated in 2016&#8212;I hope that it will not be&#8212;it could mean that we had people from UKIP in this Parliament.</p><p>I heard what Bob Doris said about social attitudes, but a recent social attitudes survey said that 60 per cent of Scottish residents thought that immigration should be reduced.

I do not think that anybody has done more than she has to promote it since the Parliament began. That work includes her member&#8217;s bill in 2004, which protected mothers who wish to breastfeed in public, and motions that she has lodged since then.</p><p>Promoting breastfeeding in public is more controversial than promoting breastfeeding per se, and Elaine Smith has had the courage over the years to take on that controversy. She made the important point today that milk substitute is a by-product of the dairy industry and is not designed to suit young human beings. Biochemically, it is nothing like human milk.</p><p>Encouraging breastfeeding in public is important for similar reasons to those for discouraging smoking in public places. We discourage smoking in public places for public health reasons and because seeing people smoking normalises it. If children continually see people smoking, it will seem to them to be normal behaviour and they will do it. Similarly, seeing mothers breastfeeding in public normalises breastfeeding, so even if children and young people have not seen a young member of their family being breastfed, it will still be part of normal and expected maternal behaviour.</p><p>Statistics that were published last year showed that more than 47 per cent of babies were breastfed at 10 days, which fell to 36 per cent at six to eight weeks and, of them, 25 per cent were exclusively breastfed. Unfortunately, those rates are similar to the rates 10 years ago. We seem to be no nearer hitting the target of 50 per cent being breastfed at six weeks, despite the passage of Elaine Smith&#8217;s act. Like others, I believe that more needs to be done to promote the advantages of breastfeeding, and to use and publicise the legislation.</p><p>We need to dispel some of the negative information that deters too many women from even considering breastfeeding. One factor is the perception that breastfeeding is bound to be very difficult and sore. It can be for some women and, as Elaine Smith said, a small proportion of women are unable to breastfeed at all. That should be understood, but most women can breastfeed and some find it easy and straightforward. I was one of them. I have three children and breastfed them all until they decided that they wanted to give up. I have absolutely no recollection of finding it difficult, although I have to say that birth was another matter.</p><p>Having the opportunity to breastfeed on demand was another matter. My children are now 28, 26 and 24, and in the days when I was breastfeeding, doing it in public places was pretty difficult unless you were wearing a suitably encompassing and camouflaging garment. I returned to work full time when my eldest child was four months old. My son&#8217;s childminder was supportive and had breastfed all five of her children, but I had to express milk for my son in the toilet at work. I have never prepared anybody else&#8217;s meal in a toilet&#8212;not even a dog&#8217;s meal.</p><p>I want to draw attention to the weight charts that indicate that children should double or triple their weight by certain times. Those do not work for breastfed children, because they do not put on weight so quickly. That ought to be understood, so that breastfeeding mothers do not feel that they are somehow not giving their children enough nutrition.</p><p>Breastfeeding has a whole load of advantages. The most important is for the child&#8217;s health, as members have said. My youngest son was born during a norovirus epidemic, which was pretty worrying in relation to newborns. All five of my family managed to get it, but my six-week old baby was the least ill of all of us because he was protected by my antibodies. Other children of that age are no so protected.</p><p>Night feeding was easy. There was no messing around with heating up bottles to the right temperature and all that nonsense. I could almost literally do it in my sleep&#8212;not that I would necessarily recommend that. Obviously, partners cannot be much help with the feeding, but they can assist with other night-time jobs such as changing nappies.</p><p>Another advantage is weight loss: I went back to my pre-pregnancy weight fairly quickly after giving birth. All my children were born during the Christmas and new year period and I was able to have all the Christmas goodies&#8212;the chocolate, the cheese, the Christmas cake and everything else&#8212;and still lose weight. Happy days! They never came back, unfortunately.</p><p>Breastfeeding is great for babies and for their mothers.

There was no intention on our part to suggest that there was a turf war. A progression took place between the passing of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and March 2006, when Cathy Jamieson announced that &#163;2 million of criminal gains would be reinvested in areas of Scotland that were hardest hit by crime. Those funds were targeted at local authority wards in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Inverclyde, North Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire to show young people in those areas that crime did not pay.

As others mentioned, it is estimated that serious organised crime costs the Scottish economy about &#163;2 billion per annum, but last year we managed to seize only &#163;8 million of that. There is general agreement that we could do more in that regard.</p><p>A number of colleagues raised concerns about the lack of information and the correlation with communities in which the highest percentages of children and young people are living in poverty. I think that that is the point that Patricia Ferguson was making. One in three children in Glasgow lives in poverty, yet Glasgow receives only slightly more than the Scottish average per 10,000 young people.

Duncan McNeil asked how cashback could work better and what outcomes we could expect to see. Bruce Crawford made extremely important points about evaluation of the economic benefit of the programme and youth employment. What is more important in diverting young people away from crime than having a job? Malcolm Chisholm commented on the allocation to different activities and questioned whether enough was being put into early years and disadvantaged communities. We cannot just assume that, because someone is taking part in sport, they are not taking part in crime, and that, if they were not taking part in sport, they would be taking part in crime. It is not logical to turn the proposition on its head. We need to know whether we are reaching those people who need to be diverted from crime rather than providing opportunities for young people who would never commit a crime anyway.</p><p>There are many good projects. In my constituency, the cashback programme supports a range of community sporting and cultural activities. For example, as in other areas, it supports the Bank of Scotland midnight league, along with the SFA and others. Earlier this year, I went to watch the midnight league at the Hillview leisure centre in Kelloholm. Despite the fact that it was a horrendously wet and miserable night with horizontal rain, about 20 young men were engaged in playing football. Kelloholm is a former mining community and one of the 15 per cent most deprived communities as measured by the Scottish index of multiple deprivation. It is good to see money being provided to support communities.</p><p>Dumfries and Galloway has many reasons to be grateful to the cashback scheme. We used to be the only region in Scotland not to have a 3G pitch. Thanks to contributions from cashback, sportscotland and others, by 2012-13 it had three pitches&#8212;one in Annan, one in Dumfries and one in Stranraer&#8212;and we now have another one at Queen of the South, so we have a lot to be grateful to the programme for.</p><p>I will say a bit about an issue that worries not only me but a number of members, including Alison McInnes and John Pentland, and Annabel Goldie who mentioned it in summing up. It concerns the &#163;6 million that has appeared in Police Scotland&#8217;s revenue budget, and which looks as if it could be substituting for some things that Police Scotland already did.</p><p>The revenue budget proposal that was presented to the SPA board at its meeting in Inverness in March stated at paragraph 2.9:</p><p>&#8220;in addition to Grant in Aid funding &#163;1,016m, further funding of &#163;6m has been anticipated in 2014/15 representing the expected resources from the Proceeds of Crime Act, which the Scottish Government will allocate to the Authority. This funding is to be applied to support Police Scotland&#8217;s payments to third parties in our communities&#8221;.</p><p>That funding seems to be new, as I cannot see it in the budget document&#8212;which was in a different format&#8212;that was approved in the previous year.</p><p>Furthermore, Assistant Chief Constable Ruaraidh Nicolson was pretty sure that the funding was needed to supplement Police Scotland&#8217;s budget. He told Holyrood Magazine in March that Police Scotland wanted the Government to</p><p>&#8220;fund these projects that Police Scotland is no longer able to fund&#8212;community projects&#8212;through the proceeds of crime&#8221;.</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no question that community projects are under threat ... some will have to stop.

The paper stated that the Government had written to the SPA to confirm that</p><p>&#8220;estimates of anticipated receipts from the proceeds of crime can be contained with budget proposals for 2014/15 and 2015/16.&#8221;</p><p>That money was to be applied to</p><p>&#8220;support Police Scotland&#8217;s payments to third parties and in our communities&#8221;,</p><p>and a bidding process would be required.</p><p>The paper goes on to give examples of initiatives, organisations and community organisations that have previously been supported by Police Scotland, such as the National Crime Agency, CCTV, Crimestoppers Trust, a community fund, the Police Scotland youth volunteer scheme and VIPER, the video identification parades electronic recording system.</p><p>I want to know whether the &#163;6 million from cashback is now substituting this year for funding that was previously supplied by Police Scotland&#8217;s budget.

Does the &#163;24 million over three years for cashback that the cabinet secretary announced include that funding? Is the funding in the Police Scotland budget now being considered as part of the cashback scheme?</p><p>Given the content of the two papers that went to the SPA board in March and April, I was puzzled by the written answer that the cabinet secretary gave to my colleague Graeme Pearson in May this year. It stated:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government has not currently allocated any money seized under the proceeds of crime legislation to support the budget of Police Scotland or the Scottish Police Authority in 2014-15 or 2015-16.&#8221;</p><p>and that</p><p>&#8220;The Task Force agreed that, should additional proceeds of crime funding become available, it will advise Scottish Ministers on the options of how to allocate the money&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Written Answers, 22 May 2014; S4W-21076.]</p><p>Graeme Pearson&#8217;s question was answered after the Scottish Government had, apparently, written to the SPA to confirm that the receipts could be added to the revenue budget. Some clarification is required, and I would be grateful if the cabinet secretary could put that on record so that we know what is going on, because the situation seems to be very unclear.</p><p>We all agree that the cashback scheme is a success, but I need to know the answer to my question.

I wonder whether there is a wee bit of motivation to try to embarrass members of other parties&#8212;possibly even people who admitted at that time that there was a case for the devolution of APD, such as me. I will certainly not deny what I said at that time, but there are issues that need to be counterbalanced with that.</p><p>I will illustrate with a local example some of the problems and the difficulty that there could be with having two different regimes in the United Kingdom.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Air Passenger Duty"}, {"date": "2014-06-03", "body": "<p>No. I would like to illustrate some of the problems with my local example. I am sure that, if Kevin Stewart was speaking, he would have a local example that he wished to use.</p><p>For my constituents, airports in the north of England are as accessible as those in the central belt of Scotland, and they are probably more widely used. In fact, passengers can take a train directly into Manchester airport from Lockerbie or from Dumfries, Annan or Gretna by changing at Carlisle. There has been a long-cherished wish in the Solway basin to have Carlisle airport opened to passenger flights. Unfortunately, that aspiration was disappointed in March this year, when an application for the development of Carlisle airport was overturned in the High Court after a challenge from a local farmer. Nevertheless, the Stobart Group still hopes to bring forward another application, which it hopes will result in daily passenger flights to Dublin and London. Obviously, if that aspiration is eventually realised&#8212;I accept that it has been discussed for many years without there being much significant progress&#8212;it could really open up additional tourism potential for Dumfries and Galloway.</p><p>If it is unfair that passengers who go to and from Scottish airports may have to pay air passenger duty twice if there are no direct flights from those airports&#8212;I made that point in the debate back in November 2012&#8212;it is equally unfair that passengers who travel to and from airports in the northern parts of England, which could include some of my constituents who cross the border to do that, should have to pay twice. There could be the opposite situation in which people travel from the north of England to Scottish airports. Why should any of us have to pay twice because there is no direct flight from our own airport? Indeed, airports in the north of England and their passengers could be disadvantaged not only with respect to London but with respect to Scotland and Wales under the devolution of APD. The situation is therefore complex.</p><p>Our amendment back in November 2012 urged the UK Government to take action to resolve that anomaly, as it disadvantages passengers from airports in Scotland, Wales and the north of England. I am not sure whether that is being addressed by some of the reforms that the UK Government has proposed. Perhaps a Conservative member could enlighten us on whether there are any intentions to resolve that anomaly. Devolving APD at this stage could result in tax competition, as we have heard from Mark Griffin and other members, rather than resolve the wider issues around the way in which the tax operates. The great thing about devolution is that it can be reviewed and refined in the light of experience; indeed, that is happening. Unfortunately, if we decide on independence, there is no way back if we do not happen to like it.</p><p>When the tax was introduced in 1994, climate change was far further down the agenda as a priority. As Claudia Beamish pointed out, the Scottish Parliament passed the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, which committed us to a 42 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020, which is only six years from now, and an 80 per cent reduction by 2050. It is important that that act included our share of emissions from international aviation and shipping. That was quite bold, and we recognised that as part of the ground-breaking legislation that we passed. The Scottish Government has missed its annual reduction targets for two years in succession, so we have a problem. We set ourselves targets and did not reach them.</p><p>I do not know that APD as it stands is the best way of controlling aircraft emissions, but I do not endorse any approach that is simply about reducing the tax and eventually removing APD altogether without replacing it with some other form of taxation on aviation emissions. Perhaps taxing passengers is not the best way; perhaps there are ways in which taxation could be aimed at companies that use aircraft or fuels that are more polluting. There might be ways in which we could refine the approach, but I do not think that it is correct to take away the tax altogether.</p><p>In fact, I recall that, in the debate to which I referred, Stewart Stevenson gave some interesting examples of possible ways to tackle aviation emissions, which related to different types of fuel and so on. Consideration needs to be given to how APD could be reformed, which is what Labour colleagues in Westminster have been urging the UK Government to do.</p><p>The Scottish Government says in the motion that it would</p><p>&#8220;reduce APD by 50% in the first term of an independent Scottish Parliament&#8221;.</p><p>I am slightly puzzled as to why it wants APD to be devolved only if there is a yes vote in September, whereas previously it wanted APD to be devolved, full stop. That aside, as we have heard, the Government proposal to cut APD by 50 per cent would remove &#163;135 million from the Scottish budget, but we have no indication of where the money would come from. I expect that, as with the proposed &#163;385 million cut to corporation tax, the Scottish Government answer will be that the money would come from economic growth&#8212;in fact, we have already heard that.</p><p>There is still a problem, however. Gavin Brown got one of the SNP members&#8212;I cannot remember which one&#8212;to admit the problem, which is that, even in the unlikely event that the Scottish Government&#8217;s highly optimistic assertions are correct and there is economic growth, it will not happen instantaneously, but the cuts to the budget will bite as soon as they are implemented. From the start, &#163;135 million would be removed from the budget in order to make it cheaper for Scottish residents to fly off on holiday. We all like a cheap holiday&#8212;I do as much as anybody else&#8212;so that would be popular, but is it really the best use of &#163;135 million?</p><p>If there is &#163;135 million kicking around with nothing to be done with it, might it not be better to use it to invest in our public transport system, which gets people to and from work every day and contributes to economic growth? Alternatively, perhaps it could be used to reinstate some of the rail projects that the Scottish Government has either abandoned or delayed. Those would also contribute to economic growth, and would do it in a sustainable manner.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Air Passenger Duty"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14070.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14070", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Elaine Murray", "member_id": "80467", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Dumfriesshire"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Elaine", "last_name": "Murray", "left_house": "2011-03-23", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14070.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14070", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Elaine Murray", "member_id": "80369", "entered_house": "2007-05-03", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Dumfries"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Elaine", "last_name": "Murray", "left_house": "2007-04-02", "title": "Dr", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14070.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14070", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Dr Elaine Murray", "member_id": "80094", "entered_house": "2003-05-01", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Dumfries"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Elaine", "last_name": "Murray", "left_house": "2003-03-31", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14070.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14070", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Elaine Murray", "member_id": "80219", "entered_house": "1999-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Dumfries"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Iain", "last_name": "Gray", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>The innovation centres are undoubtedly a welcome initiative, but they are very reminiscent of and identical in purpose to the intermediary technology institutes, which were launched back in 2002 with almost four times the budget, even then.

Einstein said:</p><p>&#8220;The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.&#8221;</p><p>I doubt that Einstein ever had to worry about land and buildings transaction tax, and he certainly did not have to worry about landfill tax, so we can probably assume he was talking about the complexity of tax in general. When I looked back at that stage 1 debate, I saw that most of us began by noting how dull tax legislation is considered to be and how complicated it turns out to be&#8212;although I have spotted one accountant of my acquaintance who has been drawn to the public gallery by our deliberations, so these things are a matter of taste.</p><p>Perhaps it is a sign of the times that we live in that today&#8217;s debate&#8212;technical, pragmatic and, above all, consensual&#8212;feels rather like light relief from what passes for political discourse the rest of the time at the moment. The fact is that although we began with the shared purpose of creating revenue Scotland to administer and manage the devolved taxes&#8212;the landfill tax and the land and buildings transaction tax&#8212;it still turned out to be a complex task to get right sometimes, despite that consensus and shared purpose. That is all the more reason to congratulate the bill team on its work in drafting and redrafting the legislation to get us to the position that we are in today, where I think that we can be sure that the bill will be passed overwhelmingly&#8212;indeed, unanimously&#8212;at decision time.</p><p>The Finance Committee, on which I do not sit, deserves our thanks, too: first, for taking comprehensive, complicated and exhaustive evidence on the bill at stage 1; and, secondly, for dealing with some 300 amendments at stage 2. Perhaps unusually for me, I also want to praise the cabinet secretary for his efforts in steering the legislation through, including the further 140 amendments dealt with today. There have been almost 450 amendments since the bill was introduced and although we dealt with the 140 amendments in pretty short order this afternoon, they included some significant improvements in response to the committee&#8217;s scrutiny of the bill. I will mention some of them in a moment.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary noted, today marks not just the completion of the passage of the Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill but the completion of a trilogy of linked bills that create the first devolved national taxes and the body that will administer and manage them. Therefore, we are completing a significant task today, and I am tempted to say to the cabinet secretary that, apart from pursuing the important matter of a future for the Ferguson shipyard, perhaps he should take the next few weeks off, put his feet up and stay out of trouble. However, I expect that he has other plans, which is a pity in a way because the task that he is completing today is real proof of the power and flexibility of the devolution settlement that I fear he will spend the next four weeks trying to destroy.</p><p>The three bills, of which this is the third, derive, of course, from the Calman process and the consequent Scotland Act 2012. They constitute a significant step forward in rebalancing the devolution settlement by securing new fiscal powers and decision making for this Parliament without breaking the social, economic and political union with the rest of the United Kingdom that provides us with such significant opportunities. Nonetheless, we have consensus for today on the bill</p><p>That consensus started with the approach that was taken to creating a new tax system&#8212;the fundamental principle. The cabinet secretary made much of his starting point being Adam Smith&#8217;s four maxims for a tax system: certainty, convenience, efficiency and proportionality in relation to the ability to pay. He was right, and has had support across the chamber for that principle-based approach to the legislation.</p><p>It has been interesting to see how turning those maxims into detailed legislation is less straightforward than might have been assumed, as they can sometimes contradict themselves, but I think that some of the 400-odd amendments have taken us in the right direction. For example, we now have on the face of the bill greater certainty over penalties. More important, amendments both at stage 2 and at stage 3 today have made the definitions of what constitutes tax avoidance much clearer and more certain.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary knows, we have supported his approach to tax avoidance from the start. We agree with him that we should have a general anti-avoidance rule rather than a general anti-abuse rule. We agree that the double reasonableness test should be avoided, that the test should be of artificiality rather than of abusiveness and that arrangements where tax avoidance is one of the purposes&#8212;not just the sole or main purpose&#8212;should also be caught by the general rule. In other words, we agree with the cabinet secretary that the net should be cast wider than in previous legislation&#8212;as, indeed, it has been.</p><p>However, we have pursued further clarity, notably through Malcolm Chisholm in committee, and I am glad to acknowledge once again that the cabinet secretary has put it beyond doubt that the general rule applies to transactions between individuals as well as companies or businesses.</p><p>In his speech, the cabinet secretary referred to the consultation, guidance and secondary legislation that will follow the passing of the bill. We should acknowledge that there is still work to be done. Indeed, we will not know whether the bill meets the maxim of efficiency until it is tested in action; of certainty until consequent guidance and secondary legislation are completed; or of proportionality until tax rates are actually announced, which will have to happen quite soon, as the cabinet secretary must know.</p><p>However, we can claim a good piece of legislation&#8212;one that has been improved by the legislative process and which can, should and will, I am sure, be supported at decision time.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>In the spirit of the famous game &#8220;Scissors, paper, stone&#8221;, the fact is that Peter May&#8217;s product will eventually end up in landfill and be subject to the landfill tax that Mr Swinney has introduced.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>Whatever the Daily Mail has said, we have all read what the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth said to his Cabinet colleagues when he warned that the volatility of oil revenues would compromise the affordability of pensions in an independent Scotland.</p><p>Yesterday, we saw that the previous year&#8217;s oil revenues were half what the Scottish Government had told us that they would be.

It repeats figures about, for example, the economic impact of childcare&#8212;figures that do not add up and which the Government has already had to admit were simply made up without any modelling. Today, we found out that the Scottish Government also had to admit that its figures on productivity, employment rates and migration have also been made up without any economic modelling.</p><p>The plan talks about powers to incentivise growth and job creation. The cabinet secretary spoke about that at length again today, but yet again the only actual policy that the plan outlines is a 3 per cent cut in corporation tax, which it claims could create 27,000 jobs. That claim does have some modelling behind it, which was published three years ago, and I asked the Scottish Parliament information centre to have a look at it. SPICe tells us that not only are the calculations based on 2006, when the corporation tax rate was 30 per cent, but&#8212;by accident or design&#8212;the Scottish Government used the headline rate change of 3 per cent in its jobs calculation when it should in fact have used the effective rate change of 1.2 per cent, by its own calculation. To quote SPICe:</p><p>&#8220;If the effective rate change was used instead of the change in headline rate, then the number of additional foreign direct investment jobs would be 60 per cent fewer than in the Scottish Government&#8217;s analysis.&#8221;</p><p>Most of the claims in the plan have no credible figures behind them at all, and where they do have figures behind them, the Scottish Government has got its sums wrong again. We should compare those hollow promises with the 800 jobs that were secured this morning by another Ministry of Defence order for the Clyde&#8212;real jobs building real ships in the real world.</p><p>If Mr Swinney&#8217;s assertions about the benefits of independence had any credibility, surely those in the businesses that he says would benefit from the increase in economic opportunity would be convinced of his case, but they are not. Big financial companies remain unconvinced&#8212;companies such as Standard Life, which employs 5,000 people in this city, managing &#163;254 billion of assets for a customer base 90 per cent of which is situated in the rest of the UK. It told us just last week that, after five months, it has had no answers to its concerns about independence and its preparations to move business and personnel out of Scotland continue.</p><p>Large manufacturing companies remain unconvinced, too. For example, the chief executive of the Weir Group, Keith Cochrane, recently said that material issues for the company had not been addressed and that independence would damage investment in Scotland, not help it. Companies in the energy industry, which is so beloved of the Scottish Government, remain unconvinced too&#8212;companies such as Infinis, which last week put its current wind power developments in Scotland on hold until after the referendum.</p><p>Small and medium-sized companies remain unconvinced&#8212;companies such as Endura, which I met a couple of weeks ago. It designs, makes and sells across the world top-of-the-range cycle wear from Livingston. It marries innovation, technology, R and D, design and fashion to compete in a global market. It employs women and graduates and it clothes the top touring cycle team in the world. That company does everything right, and it is adamant that a yes vote would require it to start moving operations and jobs to Europe on September 19.</p><p>That is how unconvinced Scotland is of the premise that independence will create economic opportunity, and the past week can only have increased concerns. Nothing is more fundamental to economic opportunity than a stable economic base, and nothing is more fundamental to that than a stable currency.

After careful consideration, we will be supporting calls for Alex Neil to resign, for the simple reason that we believe that it cannot be acceptable for a minister to come to the chamber and allow Parliament to be misled.</p><p>We have all seen the evidence, but it is worth going over once again. On 26 September 2012, Alex Neil told Parliament that he believed that NHS Lanarkshire was revising its plans on mental health services at Monklands. A few hours later, he announced that he would be removing himself from the formal decision-making process surrounding the plan, because of his constituency interests.</p><p>That was all accepted in good faith but, thanks to a freedom of information request, we now know that, five hours before addressing Parliament, Alex Neil&#8217;s private secretary had emailed a civil servant in the health department. That email could not have been clearer. Sent to health officials in the Scottish Government, it declared that Mr Neil was clear that the mental health facilities should be retained. It concluded:</p><p>&#8220;The Cabinet Secretary has asked that you seek agreement from NHS Lanarkshire to reconfigure their plans accordingly.&#8221;</p><p>Astonishingly, even Michael Matheson was copied into the email. So, in the morning, he was made aware that the decision to retain Monklands had already been made by his superior yet, that very afternoon, he was told that the decision over Monklands was being delegated to him.</p><p>It is of course the right of every member of the Parliament, be they a minister or not, to oppose decisions that affect their constituents, and we do not disagree that, as a newly appointed minister, Mr Neil was within his rights to reconsider decisions that his predecessor had taken. However, the issue here is not about the rights and wrongs of closing medical facilities at Monklands, and nor is it about Mr Neil&#8217;s competence in his job. The issue at hand is a cabinet secretary who ordered his officials to do one thing in the morning and then decided consciously not to reveal that fact to Parliament in the afternoon.</p><p>I suggest that this is a sad instance of a minister deliberately allowing an untruth to gain credence in order to avoid difficult questions about his position. Mr Neil should have told Parliament that afternoon that he had just told NHS Lanarkshire to &#8220;reconfigure their plans&#8221;. That he did not do so was not just a dereliction of duty; it now looks suspiciously like a tacit admission that he knew that he was doing something underhand and wrong&#8212;it is as simple as that.</p><p>The fact is that the investigation that the First Minister carried out into the case failed utterly to address that point. The First Minister said that the health secretary acted &#8220;perfectly properly&#8221;. His defence of Mr Neil goes on to note that Mr Neil was concerned over a conflict of interest, but nowhere in the First Minister&#8217;s letter exonerating Mr Neil is the key point raised&#8212;that, by the time that Mr Neil raised his concerns about a conflict of interest, his wishes had already been made clear to NHS Lanarkshire. Nowhere is there acknowledgement of the fact that Mr Neil made the decision and then tried to wash his hands of it. Now, by refusing to sack his health secretary, the First Minister is putting politics above the Parliament.</p><p>The whole episode is symptomatic of the SNP&#8217;s disregard for the Parliament, particularly in the run-up to the independence referendum. It gives us in the Conservatives no pleasure to conclude that, in this instance, the cabinet secretary deliberately ensured that Parliament was misled. As he clearly did so, we can no longer have confidence in him in carrying out his duties, so we support the motion of no confidence.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Motion of No Confidence"}, {"date": "2014-05-14", "body": "<p></p><p>1.

That gap is a vicious circle that prevents children from realising their full potential. Although the cabinet secretary is fully aware of that fact, he seems very reluctant to consider any fundamental changes to our system of schooling to resolve the problem. Surely in the name of equality of opportunity we need a much bolder agenda that empowers headteachers, increases autonomy and gives parents and pupils a real choice when it comes to schooling.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Attainment Gap"}, {"date": "2014-04-24", "body": "<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the stage 1 debate on this important bill, because housing is probably the single biggest issue about which constituents in my Borders constituency contact me. I am sure that the same is true for many members.</p><p>What most concerns my constituents is that local people often cannot secure social housing in their communities, which is frustrating. People are forced to apply for and often take housing in the larger towns across the Borders, which might be several miles from the rest of their family and community and some distance from their place of work. Such an approach does not support local housing associations&#8217; aims to encourage a cohesive community.</p><p>A few miles might not sound like a lot, but it is important to recognise that in rural communities such as we have in the Borders the difference between living in Eyemouth and living in Duns, Jedburgh or Earlston can be profound and significant for many people. Members should try asking a family from Hawick to live in Galashiels, or vice versa.</p><p>I believe that it is important, therefore, that the bill is amended to give social landlords the ability to include extra priority for applicants with a local connection. I am not saying that that should be an ace card that takes priority over every other factor. Clearly, those applicants who are homeless or who have a particular medical need must still be given the relevant priority. However, where all other things are equal, I believe that a local connection should be taken into account in the allocations process.</p><p>It is therefore my intention to lodge amendments at stage 2 to cover the issue. I fully accept that the concept of local will be different in each part of Scotland. What is local in the Borders will be completely different from how local might be defined in Glasgow. I hope that my amendment will ensure that the definition of local is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the different requirements of Scotland.</p><p>In my remaining time, I wish to mention the other concern that constituents have raised with me&#8212;the bill&#8217;s provisions to reform the site licensing system for mobile home sites with permanent residents. I represent several such sites, including Springwood village, near Kelso. I have been in correspondence with the minister about that issue and she is well aware of the concerns of both the site owner and the residents, so I will not repeat them now. However, the key point is that, although the intention may well be to target unscrupulous site owners who have sought to exploit weaknesses in the current licensing regime, the bill could have the opposite effect.</p><p>I can cite a couple of important examples, one of which is the proposal to have a three-year licence term for site licences. I know that the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee highlighted concerns that financial lenders may withdraw support for sites on the basis of the introduction of fixed-term licences. Many of my constituents have invested large sums of money in their homes, and that should not be undermined by the imposition of that fixed-term licence period. Like the committee, I would encourage the Scottish Government to work with the lending groups to clarify their views on the introduction of a fixed-term three-year licence. Given the concerns that have been raised with me, I will lodge an amendment at stage 2 to increase the fixed term to at least five years.</p><p>There are other aspects of the bill intended for site licensing that raise concerns, not least in relation to the fit-and-proper person test. I would be grateful if the minister could clarify in her closing remarks whether the Government looked at experiences in England in drafting those provisions.</p><p>There is much in the bill that we can support. There are areas that need significant improvement but, as my colleague Alex Johnstone explained, the fundamental flaw is the abolition of the right to buy. Many of my constituents will be deeply disappointed by the removal of that right, but I fully recognise that that is a minority view in this chamber.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-04-03", "body": "<p>I welcome the debate and&#8212;unlike the other Borders MSP, apparently&#8212;the opportunity to stand up for local justice.</p><p>I completely agree with the tenor and content of Jim Hume&#8217;s motion, although I point out that, while court closures were recommended by the Scottish Court Service, the decision was made very much by the Justice Committee, and the decision to close sheriff courts in Duns, Haddington, Kirkcudbright and Peebles was forced through by the Scottish National Party members on the committee. I was proud to vote against the proposal.</p><p>Duns, in my constituency, hears&#8212;despite not being the busiest of courts&#8212;more than 330 sheriff cases a year, and the JP court sits fortnightly. I am in no doubt that it was an important local service that was worth fighting for.</p><p>The closure of Duns sheriff court will force victims and witnesses to travel more than 30 miles to Jedburgh sheriff court. Indeed, the Scottish Court Service has conceded that the closure will result in some of my constituents being unable to travel to Jedburgh by public transport without an overnight stay, which clearly breaches the SCS&#8217;s own principles for provision of access to justice. The closure of the courts will place a huge amount of stress on courts that remain open and are forced to take on thousands of additional cases.</p><p>As the motion recognises, the closures will result in the withdrawal of high-quality civil service job opportunities in the Borders, which is a particular blow to such a rural area. The Scotland-wide court closures are yet further evidence of the SNP&#8217;s increasingly urban prioritisation and centralising tendency. They represent the diversion of more and more public services to the central belt and major cities, thereby ignoring the importance of local services and local access to justice in areas such as the Borders.</p><p>Alternatives to court closures exist; they include moving courts to a part-time basis and making better use of existing public buildings. In my constituency, to add insult to injury, the closure of Duns will make only relatively minor savings, which means that an important local service will be lost for only a minimal gain to the Scottish Court Service&#8217;s budget.</p><p>It is noticeable, and perhaps telling, that very few SNP members are in the chamber for the debate.

The Scottish Court Service is currently assessing the most effective method of future provision of an integrated justice service for the Borders. That clearly means that further closures are being actively considered, and the number of courts in the Borders might yet fall from four to just one.</p><p>I hope that the Scottish Court Service will learn lessons from last year and properly consult and listen to the views of local residents who are telling me loud and clear that local justice matters and is important.

That means promoting payment of fair prices, safe and healthy working conditions and responsible environmental practices.</p><p>In a sense, it is unfortunate that the fair trade movement is even needed, and that corporate responsibility and responsible trading and sourcing are not already commonplace. However, it is a positive sign that sales of fairly traded products are increasing year on year, and today exceed &#163;1.5&#160;billion in the United Kingdom alone. One in every three bananas that are sold in the UK is Fairtrade certified, almost half of all bagged sugar that is sold in the UK is Fairtrade certified, and a quarter of all coffee that is sold in the UK is Fairtrade certified.

I have attended several fair trade events across the Borders, which are credit to the Borders groups that contributed to Scotland&#8217;s being awarded the coveted fair trade status. Ever since Selkirk was awarded fair trade status more than a year ago, I am pleased to report that support has been growing across the Borders for the fair trade movement. A number of other Borders towns are looking to follow Selkirk&#8217;s lead, and a Borders fair trade steering group has been established, so I hope that the Borders will soon be designated as a fair trade region.

During last week and this, events are being held across the country to promote the work of the fair trade campaign. From Selkirk to St Andrews, from Airdrie to Aberdeen, communities across Scotland will be learning about the great work that is being done by the fair trade movement, and how they can get involved.</p><p>Fair trade is the only way that we can guarantee a fair deal for food producers, who so often get squeezed and are left with little money for what they make. Through the initiative, many people in developing countries now receive far more money for their goods and it is important that we do what we can to support it. Too often at the checkout, we are more concerned about the price tag than we are about the origin of the products that we are buying and the effort that goes into their production.</p><p>One of the key achievements of the Fairtrade Foundation was its setting of a minimum price that a buyer of Fairtrade products has to pay to a producer organisation. Most products&#8212;including coffee, cocoa, tea and bananas&#8212;have been set a minimum price that covers the costs of sustainable production. That ensures that local producers are not squeezed out of the market by larger producers that are more able to bear the burden of reduced profit margins. However, fair trade is not just about prices; it is also about standards that ensure that products are produced and traded under fair and environmentally responsible conditions.</p><p>Whether it is buying items with the official Fairtrade logo on them, or drumming up support at a local school, office or community group, anyone can help to support fair trade, and it is our responsibility in this Parliament to lead by example.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Fair Trade Nation (First Anniversary)"}, {"date": "2014-03-04", "body": "<p>I, too, congratulate Claudia Beamish on securing the debate.

The bill has proved uncontroversial, but it has been unusual in the sense that it is the first private bill to come before Parliament that deals with two different and unconnected purposes. The first purpose of the bill is to amend section 22 of the schedule to the City of Edinburgh District Council Order Confirmation Act 1991, to allow for the erection of a statue of John Rattray on Leith Links in Edinburgh. Section 22 currently prohibits the erection of buildings, including monuments or statues, on the links.</p><p>The subject of the statue, John Rattray, was the first captain of the Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which staged the first official golf match at Leith Links in 1744. That came about when Rattray and his fellow golfers asked the city council for a silver club to be awarded annually to the winner of an open golf competition, to replace the previous prizes, which included legs of mutton and firkins of whisky. The council agreed to offer such a prize only if rules were set down and signed by Rattray, as it wanted to change the custom of the rules being made up on the day of a game. The rules written down in 1744 form the basis of the rules of today&#8217;s game of golf.</p><p>Rattray himself was a very interesting character. He was a surgeon and a member of the Royal Company of Archers, as well being a keen golfer. After winning the Leith open golf competition in 1744 and 1745, he left to join the Jacobite army, and tended to the wounded at the battle of Prestonpans. He accompanied Bonnie Prince Charlie&#8217;s army south to Derby and back to face defeat at Culloden, where he was seized. John Rattray was saved from being hanged only when his golfing partner and Scotland&#8217;s top judge of the time, Lord Forbes, made a personal plea on his behalf.</p><p>The sculptor commissioned to create the statue is David Annand, who has created a number of statues of prominent Scots, including the motor racing world champion from the Borders, Jim Clark; famous accordion player Sir Jimmy Shand; poet Robert Burns; and this Parliament&#8217;s very own Winnie Ewing.</p><p>As I said in the preliminary stage debate on the bill, the committee is satisfied that the bill will create an exception only for this particular statue and that no further development can take place on the site at Leith Links. The committee was also satisfied that the Leith Rules Golf Society will provide to the council between 10 and 15 per cent of the capital cost of the statue for its on-going maintenance, in keeping with normal practice.</p><p>The second objective of the bill is the revitalisation of a fund that was originally set up to assist people caught up in a series of fires in Edinburgh High Street in 1824. The Surplus Fire Fund has grown from the &#163;11,000 originally collected to &#163;1.25&#160;million, which generates approximately &#163;30,000 per annum.</p><p>The fund had fallen into a state of dormancy until the Fire Brigades Union contacted the City of Edinburgh Council in 2001, which led to its reactivation. The council&#8217;s pensions and trusts committee discussed the future management of the fund during 2011-12, considering how its assets might be better utilised in keeping with the spirit of its current purposes, changes in society, the effectiveness of its present constitution and engagement with key stakeholders.</p><p>On 31 January 2013, the City of Edinburgh Council agreed to promote the bill, which proposes three changes to the fund: to transfer the assets, rights and liabilities of the Surplus Fire Fund to the Edinburgh Voluntary Organisations Trust, which is a Scottish registered charity; to amend the purposes for which the fund can be used; and then to dissolve the fund as it is currently constituted.</p><p>Ella Simpson, the director of the Edinburgh Voluntary Organisations Council, which is the organisation that will administer the fund under the proposals in the bill, gave evidence to the committee on its wide experience of running restricted funds and grant programmes and the large network of organisations that it works with, which could refer possible beneficiaries of the fund. She reassured the committee that the fund will be managed and awards will be apportioned across the year but that, if it cannot cover particular applications, EVOC will be able to use other funding streams at its disposal to meet the needs of the people who apply.</p><p>At present, there are few applications to the fund from private individuals, with most of the awards being made to the burns units at the Royal hospital for sick children in Edinburgh and St John&#8217;s hospital in Livingston. The promoter explained to the committee that modernising the purposes of the fund&#8212;for example, by removing the serious injury criterion&#8212;will make it possible to make awards to those who have minor or psychological injuries.</p><p>Based on the evidence that the committee received, we support the bill&#8217;s objectives and agree that a private bill is necessary and appropriate.</p><p>I thank all those who gave evidence to the committee, my fellow committee members for their robust scrutiny of the bill, and the efficient clerking team for the support that they provided to me as convener and the rest of the committee.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the City of Edinburgh Council (Leith Links and Surplus Fire Fund) Bill be passed.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Leith Links and Surplus Fire Fund) Bill: Final Stage"}, {"date": "2014-02-06", "body": "<p></p><p>1.

It is timely, because there is no doubt that land reform issues are very much in the air, largely as a result of the publication of the report of the land reform review group but also, I like to think, as a result of the Parliament&#8217;s positive history in supporting community buy-outs and ownership to the extent that, as Malcolm Chisholm said, some 500,000 acres are now community owned and run.</p><p>As an individual and as a Scottish Conservative, I very much welcome that fact. After all, it was a Conservative Government that initiated land reform in the United Kingdom. Indeed, we believe that true devolution does not and should not end with the transfer of powers to Edinburgh and that it must result in the genuine empowerment of communities or it is surely meaningless. It therefore follows that community ownership of land has to be integral to the beliefs of those of us who embrace devolution, and I certainly number myself among them.</p><p>However, I differ from some of the current thinking on how to promote increased community ownership as we take it forward. I believe strongly that successful community ownership results from local enthusiasm leading to local initiatives, local decision making and local processes.</p><p>I believe equally strongly that those processes should be based on entirely voluntary agreement. The idea that any community should have a right to buy land without the agreement of a willing seller is one that I cannot support, but that is the route that the land reform review group proposes, even if it is only as a last resort.</p><p>Even more concerning from my perspective is the proposed degree of centralisation of the process. Setting up three new Government agencies to oversee the policy is as fine an example of centralised overkill as I have ever seen and I cannot understand the logic of a centralised Government agency having the right, never mind the ability, to determine whether a proposed community buyout is able to deliver the degree of public benefit that will apparently be required if the large amounts of taxpayers&#8217; money that will have to be provided to finance such ventures are to be sanctioned. There surely must be better ways of doing that than simply setting up three new quangos.</p><p>Community ownership is really positive, but let us keep it voluntary and local because that results in land reform with harmony rather than land reform with divisiveness.

Simply putting a false cap on the amount will do nothing other than have lawyers rubbing their hands with glee as they devise schemes to drive a coach and horses through any legislation that seeks to do that.</p><p>Many of the land reform review group&#8217;s recommendations, which are largely endorsed by the Bunchrew declaration, are well intentioned but some of them are ill thought out. As I said earlier, land reform and community ownership can and should result in positive and progressive outcomes for not only the communities but the whole country.

There was not a huge turnout, but it was impossible not to be moved by the pride, the passion and the camaraderie that was still so clearly evident in the group of veterans who were in attendance as they drew themselves smartly to attention as the flag was raised. The passion, pride and camaraderie are surely totally justified because it is almost entirely thanks to their selflessness, courage and commitment that we all now enjoy a comparatively safe existence in today&#8217;s world, as the minister acknowledged in his opening speech.</p><p>It is therefore absolutely right that the motion begins by acknowledging the debt of gratitude that we owe our armed forces&#8212;past and present. That the minister himself is numbered among them simply adds to the quality of the depth of understanding of, and interest in, armed forces and veterans issues that Parliament has shown since its earliest days.</p><p>As I said in the debate on 14 January, that interest has been continued in a largely exemplary fashion by this Government, and in a way that has been welcomed by the armed forces and veterans community.

I endorse David Stewart&#8217;s feeling.</p><p>Those who in the past put their lives on the line for our security, and those who are doing so currently, deserve no less than our full support. I am quite sure that we all agree on that; everything that the minister said in his opening comments suggests that, for the time being, that will be the case.</p><p>I acknowledge the fact that the majority of ex-servicemen make a seamless transition back into civilian life. However, many need, and will continue to need, our support and interest. One of the remarkable outcomes of recent conflicts has been the incredible response of the public. I have no doubt that that response has been prompted and, in some ways, promoted by the fact that the media can now bring the stark reality of modern-day warfare virtually into our homes in a graphic and previously unimaginable way. Indeed, the sight of returning forces and, worse, the funeral cort&#232;ges of those who have paid the ultimate price has undoubtedly awoken the conscience of the public in a remarkable fashion.</p><p>Literally hundreds of charities have been established in recent years. Although that is for the very best of reasons, many of them to a degree overlap in what they seek to achieve. The result of that is growing duplication of effort that leads inevitably to competition between some charities in attracting public willingness to donate to veterans-related causes.</p><p>That point about willingness to donate highlights a further potential concern. There is little doubt that, as our involvement in overseas theatres of war reduces and the accompanying media exposure declines, the attention and interest of the general public will inevitably decline with it. That gives us a potential problem because&#8212;as I have learned all too clearly through the work of the cross-party group on armed forces veterans that I convene&#8212;often the problems and issues from which our veterans suffer do not manifest themselves until several years after those veterans are discharged. We could face declining public empathy and financial contributions, alongside a growing requirement for help and support, as many of the issues that will come to light for today&#8217;s serving personnel become evident over the next 10 to 20 years.</p><p>Many of the larger charities already recognise that. I was pleased to host a seminar in Parliament just a few weeks ago at which the Royal British Legion Scotland&#8212;now known as Legion Scotland&#8212;brought together several of the main players in the voluntary and charitable sectors to discuss its plans to restructure and work with others in partnership to provide support in the future. Others are, no doubt, doing the same.</p><p>That brings me to the role of the veterans commissioner. As the minister mentioned, I had a few reservations about that role, but I am happy to admit that many of them have dissipated somewhat as I have thought about the role more carefully. I hope that he or she will be able to take steps to ensure that the huge number of armed forces and veterans-related charities do not duplicate their efforts. If the generosity of the public is to be used to maximum effect, it is essential that any duplication of effort be addressed.</p><p>My colleague Alex Johnstone will speak later of the need for Government, local authorities, health boards and others to work together to ensure maximum effectiveness. l suggest that the commissioner might well have a role to play in that process. Although all our local authorities and health boards have dedicated armed forces champions, there is a clear need for a more joined-up approach across the public sector, as there is in the third sector, if we are to maximise support for our armed forces veterans. Some of what is needed is pretty basic; for example, many local council switchboards do not even know who the veterans champion is&#8212;if someone rings up to get him, they cannot. It is not rocket science.</p><p>The armed forces themselves still have a lot to do in ensuring that their serving personnel are fully prepared for discharge and for the intense dose of reality that often accompanies the return to civvy street. A lot has been done in recent years within the armed forces to improve that facet of service, but a lot more could and should be done. If everyone&#8212;the Ministry of Defence, the UK and Scottish Governments, our local councils, health boards and the voluntary sector&#8212;meets the coming challenges successfully, we will be able to be as proud of the lifelong support that we offer as we are of our armed forces personnel and veterans to whom we offer it.

The figures are helping to push Scotland&#8217;s gross domestic product to around &#163;28,000 per person, which is about 10 per cent higher than the figure in the UK. That is fantastic news for Scotland, despite the gloom of economic depression that has prevailed for some years now.</p><p>If we take a look at the various reasons for that, we will see that a number of policy decisions and initiatives taken in Scotland all contribute to those very positive figures. The first ever women&#8217;s employment summit, which was held in 2013 in partnership with the STUC, examined many of the barriers facing women who want to work. It is no surprise that occupational segregation, childcare and vocational routes for women into work, particularly in science and engineering, featured among the issues where some attention needed to be focused.</p><p>Funding projects such as Women Onto Work to examine progression routes and outcomes for women and extending the youth employment Scotland fund to help employers take on youngsters&#8212;particularly younger mums, who would otherwise find it difficult to get into work&#8212;are all helping.</p><p>There has been a huge jump in the number of women participating in the modern apprenticeship programme, with more than 40 per cent now being taken up by women, compared with less than 30 per cent in 2008&#8212;a very significant and positive change indeed.</p><p>Another issue that came out of the summit was that of encouraging more women to become entrepreneurs. There is quite a range of initiatives to encourage more entrepreneurship among women. According to the Hunter centre for entrepreneurship, if the number of female entrepreneurs matched the number of male entrepreneurs, another &#163;7 billion could be added to the Scottish economy. The Scottish Government has put up &#163;1 million towards schemes such as young EDGE&#8212;encouraging dynamic growth entrepreneurs&#8212;Power of Youth and Investing Women. Hopefully, new businesses will emerge, led by women, to give Scotland&#8217;s economy that additional boost.</p><p>Our Government is also tackling the occupational segregation that means that many younger women do not choose vocational pathways to work, particularly in engineering. In June, the cabinet secretary announced &#163;4.5 million to help to encourage more women into the STEM subjects. We fund the Scottish resource centre for women in science, engineering and technology and careerwise Scotland, which are both aimed at attracting more young women into science. That work will be further developed by the recently announced engineering skills investment plan.</p><p>If we can intervene as early as possible, even at nursery and primary school level, to put an additional focus on encouraging younger girls&#8217; interest in science, we will reap the rewards later. By the time that youngsters get to secondary school, it can be too late. Gender stereotyping often reinforces the belief that science and engineering are oily rag activities&#8212;only for the boys. That is difficult for young women to overcome. If we intervene earlier and show the reality and rewards of careers in science and engineering, especially for women, we stand a much better chance and all those efforts will have been worth while. The Kilmarnock Engineering and Science Society, which has been up and running for a few years, offers specifically to school pupils lectures that are often delivered by women who have reached the top in the world of science and engineering and who have never seen an oily rag once in their working lives.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest factor in getting more women into work relates to how we support childcare and make it more flexible. The welfare and benefits system that we have in place for the poorest people in our society is also an issue. We know that women who are single parents are hardest hit if Governments get those things wrong. The Scottish Government has made significant improvements to childcare since 2007. From this month, all three and four-year-olds and vulnerable two-year-olds will get 600 hours of free childcare a year. That will benefit 120,000 children and save their families about &#163;700 a year.</p><p>Delivery of the further transformation&#8212;the major change to 1,140 hours of free childcare in Scotland, which is equivalent to a whole primary school year&#8212;will require us to have control over our own tax and revenues. Make no mistake&#8212;this is not just about upping the numbers and grafting them on to our existing system, in which many women work part time and suffer pay discrimination. This is an offer to fundamentally change how childcare works in Scotland and allow many thousands of Scottish women to fully participate in our economy on an equal footing.</p><p>We know that it is Scotland&#8217;s women who bear the brunt of the cuts to the welfare system that are being imposed by the UK. Single female households lose out the most as a result of UK welfare reforms. Child benefit has been frozen, there has been a reduction in the childcare costs that are covered by working tax credits, the baby element has been removed from child tax credits&#8212;and on the list goes. That is why it was a total disgrace when Scottish Labour MPs such as Alistair Darling and nine female Scottish Labour MPs voted with the Tories to cap welfare spending, knowing that Scotland&#8217;s women would suffer the most.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s women deserve better than what they have had to put up with in the UK for years. The Scottish Government has made significant improvements to the lives of women in Scotland, and with the additional powers of independence we can completely transform childcare and tackle gender inequalities, we can help more women into business and industry and we can protect the poorest women in our country by making sure that our welfare system is fairer and does not impoverish our families. That is the prize that is waiting after independence, and I believe that Scotland&#8217;s women will back this positive change in Scottish society. All that they have to do is say yes on 18 September.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>I am a poor substitute for my colleague Stewart Stevenson, but we will hear from him in a minute or two.</p><p>It is appropriate to have this debate and celebration of Scotland&#8217;s culture in the middle of the Edinburgh festival. The fringe is the biggest arts festival in the world and, when you walk up the High Street, you would think that the whole world has come to Edinburgh.</p><p>As Kath Mainland says in her welcome in the fringe programme, the fringe is</p><p>&#8220;the greatest cultural event on the planet&#8221;</p><p>and we should expect the unexpected. With what looks like around 4,000 fringe events to choose from, it certainly is &#8220;unboring&#8221;, as the programme says, and there is something for everyone to enjoy.</p><p>I have managed to see two events so far. One is called &#8220;And the Goat Remained a Goat&#8221;, about one Harry Price, ghost hunter and man of mystery, by Professor Richard Wiseman and the fabulously talented musicians, the Creative Martyrs. The show was so weird and so funny that it is a must-see for colleagues in the chamber.</p><p>The other show that I have managed to see, which played to a packed-out audience, was by the Scottish Falsetto Sock Puppet Theatre. I have not laughed so much in years. Seeing adults in knots at a puppet show was entertaining in itself, and it seemed to lift everybody&#8217;s spirits. We all felt like kids again, for a wee while.</p><p>Anyway, enough of the plugs. The festival in Edinburgh is a massive event for Scotland, and the city is the perfect stage for what must surely be the best festival in the world, which brings in huge numbers of visitors and provides an incredible boost for the city&#8217;s economy.</p><p>Of course, it is important for Scotland, too. We have been blessed with some major festivals and events, including Celtic Connections, which I think celebrates its 22nd year next year and now attracts well over 100,000 visitors to Glasgow in January. As the cabinet secretary said, we have had a huge T in the Park this summer, starring, once again, the equally huge Kilmarnock band, Biffy Clyro. With Bannockburn, the Edinburgh festival and the major events around the Commonwealth games&#8212;of course, we will shortly host the Ryder cup, too&#8212;surely 2014 will prove to be the biggest and greatest year ever for Scotland. From Glasgow to Edinburgh and from Shetland to the Borders, Scotland has opened its doors to the world. Visitors have come in huge numbers to sample the best of what it can offer, and the Scottish people have been the most fantastic hosts.</p><p>The Lonely Planet, Wanderlust and Rough Guide travel guides have put Scotland way up there among the top recommendations for places for people to visit this year. I am sure that, when the figures come out, we will see what a hugely successful year it has been for Scotland.</p><p>The events are, of course, important in themselves for the economic benefits and international prestige that they bring to our country, but we all want to see the positive impact that they will have in our communities in the long run on things such as health, participation in sport and increasing general quality of life and job opportunities for our citizens. Those will be the real markers of success.</p><p>There have been a number of local festivals and events of note in my constituency over the summer.</p><p>Our Stewarton Bonnet Makers Guild festival has been on the go since 1933, and the Corsehill queen this year shared the limelight when the Commonwealth games baton came into town.</p><p>Only last weekend, I attended the Newmilns community gala, which has, I am told, been on the go since the days of King James I. If that is true, other festivals have a wee bit of catching up to do.</p><p>Our dearly beloved Darvel music festival is now in its 14th year and is attracting an increasing number of visitors and fantastic bands under the dedicated guidance of Neil and Sheila McKenna.</p><p>To make all the festivals&#8212;whether national or local&#8212;the successful events that they are, a rich variety of ingredients is needed, of course. Funding from the Scottish Government, the local councils and private investors makes it all financially possible. The artists and sportsmen and sportswomen need a stage on which to showcase their talents, but what really makes those festivals and events tick for me is the people on the ground who make them happen. I mean the people with a smile on their face when a person is lost and cannot find their way to a venue, and who answer the same questions day in and day out without complaining and go out of their way to ensure that our visitors have a wonderful time. I mean the people in our local communities, such as Stewarton, Newmilns and Darvel, who put endless time and energy into organising those local events, celebrating their local history and culture, and keeping up the traditions that are loved by all and help to define us as a nation.</p><p>That is what turns festivals into great events. It is not just about the shows and performances; it is the warmth of the welcome that is afforded to the people who come to visit us that makes the difference. That is what our visitors treasure, and we cannot fund or buy that.</p><p>Scotland has been the most exciting place in the world to visit this year. Our people know how to celebrate, put on a show and have a great time doing it. We are a nation that is re-emerging with greater confidence than ever in our history. I hope that the greatest celebration is shortly to come.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>In an independent Scotland, will the Scottish Government give a commitment to end current UK employment practices that see people&#8212;in particular, young people&#8212;being exploited through low wages and poor conditions of service?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Progressive Workplace Policies"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p></p><p>1.

It sends out a message that in Scotland we view the arts as a fundamental part of our society that is just as important as any one of the many other public investments we might make.</p><p>I would not claim to be an expert by any means on the history of arts funding, but my impression is that, over the years, the arts have always been first to take a hit when budgets are tight; they are sometimes seen as an unnecessary luxury and have perhaps been first for the chop. I am therefore pleased not only that the strategy has emerged but that a &#163;5 million tranche of funding will be supporting it to help Scotland to become the international leader in the youth arts.</p><p>What I like about the strategy is that it seems to strike a nice balance between setting clear themes and principles and providing an extremely flexible canvas for creative talents to emerge and find expression. You can tell from reading it that a huge number of ideas were raised during the national discussion in 2012. Nearly 1,000 young people contributed their vision to develop the strategy, which was launched last November.</p><p>Like my colleague Clare Adamson, I would like to pick out a few of the key principles. Those principles offer young people a wonderful chance, through the medium of arts, to develop themselves as individuals and to learn new skills. It is right to put young people at the heart of the strategy. They will help to determine what the priorities should be and will play a leading role in finding out what works and what does not. I am sure that there will be quite a few surprises along the way. It is also right to see how the strategy fits in the curriculum for excellence. Engaging with the arts is not an optional external bolt-on to a young person&#8217;s learning experience&#8212;it can and should be at the heart of that experience. Schools have a crucial role in helping our young folk to embrace an arts perspective that they can carry with them throughout their learning journey.</p><p>I particularly like the focus on using new digital technologies&#8212;the cabinet secretary and Clare Adamson mentioned the importance of that. Anybody who takes the time to look at what young folk are creating, producing and sharing right now with their smartphones will be amazed by the originality of the ideas and the speed with which they spread and adapt. New styles of art, music and film are emerging because the technology is decent enough to allow that, although the technology is simply the enabling tool that allows creative thinkers and artists to express themselves. What a fantastic opportunity we have to nurture that creativity. As superfast 4G services become more widespread, along with the scaling up of storage capacity, I look forward to seeing what might come out of that. Perhaps some budding new Scottish creative industry will emerge. That is not to mention the possible international collaborations, to which Christian Allard referred.</p><p>Some of the most worthwhile inclusions in the strategy are the thoughts and ideas about how we might balance participation and exclusion. For example, we know that youngsters from black and Asian communities and other minority ethnic groups are always underrepresented in the arts, so I welcome the commitments to try to address that. A striking comment in the strategy reveals that many children who live in poverty in Scotland have no access whatsoever to the arts, very often for the more obvious reasons of a lack of resources or transport. Also, in households with a disabled parent, youngsters and their families often simply cannot participate in the arts. If we make it easier for young disabled people to access culture and the arts, that can do so much to boost their confidence and self-esteem. I am therefore immensely proud that that is a key principle, and I look forward to seeing how the issue is tackled.</p><p>With that theme in mind, I bring to members&#8217; attention the work carried out by Centrestage Music Theatre in Kilmarnock in my constituency. I should declare an interest as one of its patrons. Centrestage is a social enterprise theatre company that offers a huge range of performing arts experiences to youngsters from a variety of backgrounds, many of whom are disabled or are struggling to cope with the pressures of society. About 1,800 people attend Centrestage, whose ethos is to provide opportunities to access the arts and to develop skills and leadership capabilities. Centrestage recognises and works hard on many of the inclusion and participation issues that are articulated in the youth arts strategy, so much of its work sits perfectly with the aims that are set out. I recall that the cabinet secretary visited the theatre company a number of years ago to see it for herself.</p><p>The strategy is a wonderful piece of work that deserves the Parliament&#8217;s full support. It is innovative and exciting and offers young people fantastic opportunities to unleash their creative talents. It is also inclusive and reaches out to our most disadvantaged and disabled youngsters, whose talents will find expression beyond the limitations of their circumstances. I am confident that the strategy will be a huge success and I look forward with anticipation to seeing what happens once those creative doors are well and truly opened.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; Youth Arts Strategy"}, {"date": "2014-04-29", "body": "<p>I add my thanks to my colleague Fiona McLeod for and I congratulate her on securing this debate on the really important, if sometimes overlooked, subject of hearing loss.</p><p>I also commend the work carried out by Action on Hearing Loss around Scotland. Like other members, I am grateful to Alan Dalziel, the communications and campaigns manager for Action on Hearing Loss for drawing to our attention the range of support services that the organisation provides.</p><p>What struck me first is that it is the small interventions that make the most difference. Providing basic maintenance, such as replacing tubes and batteries&#8212;which Jackson Carlaw mentioned&#8212;and cleaning out ear moulds, means that people with a hearing impairment do not need to attend hospital for such services. There are a number of advantages to that: people do not need to make journeys to the audiology departments of hospitals and staff there can concentrate on the clinical side of the work.</p><p>It is possibly of even greater importance that people with hearing impairments can feel comfortable about dropping into the various hear to help locations to meet, discuss issues and get advice and guidance on a variety of subjects. That is all extremely valuable and makes an even bigger contribution to their sense of wellbeing. It helps to reduce the isolation that people with sensory impairments all too often feel.</p><p>I am delighted to learn that two hear to help services currently operate in Kilmarnock&#8212;one in the town centre and one in Onthank, where I grew up&#8212;and that another is planned for the town of Newmilns. I am also delighted to learn that two volunteers from my constituency&#8212;Katrina Hyslop and Wilma Anderson&#8212;are in the public gallery tonight, and I offer them a warm welcome.</p><p>I was taken aback when I read that, in Scotland, there are 850,000 people with some level of hearing loss. The impact that that has on people&#8217;s lives often goes far beyond the disability itself. I will illustrate what I mean. Some time ago, I had the privilege of attending a question-and-answer session with members of the Ayrshire mission to the deaf. Their first message to me, through their interpreter, was to keep things as simple as possible, not to use complex words and concepts and, of course, to try to speak slowly for the benefit of those who were trying to lip read. It became obvious to me that people with hearing loss and hearing impairment can face an ever-widening circle of exclusion, because they cannot interpret language and its complexities as quickly as others can. For example, forms are more difficult, if not impossible, for them to understand. Queuing up in any kind of setting&#8212;for example, in job centres, council offices, shops or pubs&#8212;becomes incredibly stressful, because more time is needed to explain and to understand. People with hearing loss or impairment often give up on those types of interaction altogether.</p><p>The language in newspapers is often far too complex, and even our party political leaflets are almost unintelligible to people with hearing impairments&#8212;there is perhaps no surprise there. The experience certainly made me think carefully about how we can communicate ideas as simply as possible.</p><p>All those issues lead to further isolation. That is why the work that is carried out by Action on Hearing Loss and the hear to help service is so important. Bringing people together helps them to overcome many of those problems and it certainly helps to hold back further exclusion, which will inevitably get worse if we lose such services.</p><p>I thank Fiona McLeod for bringing to the Parliament&#8217;s attention the issues surrounding hearing loss, and I commend the work that is done by Action on Hearing Loss and the valuable contribution that it makes to enriching the lives of those with a hearing disability.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Action on Hearing Loss (Hear to Help Service)"}, {"date": "2014-04-23", "body": "<p></p><p>6.

One day in the early 1980s, I brought home a microcomputer and had to get my brother to help me to cart it into the house as it was so big and heavy.</p><p>Last night in the Parliament, I had the privilege of convening the cross-party group on digital participation. As members might expect, the group focuses on issues relating to the exclusion that James Kelly mentioned and on access to internet services. At the meeting we heard some stark messages from our contributors on the real story behind IT exclusion in Scotland.</p><p>We heard from Chris Yiu of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations that 30 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s population&#8212;approximately 1.3 million people&#8212;lack online skills, which is higher than the rate of 21 per cent for the rest of the UK.</p><p>We heard from Keith Dryburgh of Citizens Advice Scotland that only around half the clients his organisation deals with have access to an internet connection at home. More alarmingly, given the current direction of travel in the UK, three quarters of citizens advice bureaux clients said that they would struggle to apply for benefits, with 39 per cent of them saying that they could not apply online at all. We also heard from Douglas White of the Carnegie UK Trust that digital exclusion is prevalent among lower-income groups and the over 75s.</p><p>Many of the contributors asked for more to be done on improving digital literacy and people&#8217;s basic know-how to enable them to use new technology not only to enrich the quality of their lives but, in many cases, to maintain their right to ordinary benefits and to keep their heads above water.</p><p>Looking at the wide range of initiatives from the Scottish Government and its various partners that are currently under way, I am encouraged to see considerable effort and resources being aimed at tackling those exclusion issues and improving skills, along with the on-going work to encourage girls and young women in particular to consider careers in computing.</p><p>One reason for the shortage of young people who are attracted to software engineering has been a lack of expertise in schools. Most software engineers whom I knew of would be too busy working in the industry to come back to school to try to encourage youngsters along that career path. The First Minister&#8217;s announcement of &#163;6.6 million to support digital skills development is a great boost and will help us to address many of the issues that I am raising.</p><p>I am particularly pleased to read about the planned work with SCVO to reach out to some of our most excluded communities via the digital participation charter, and I am certain that our colleagues who attended the CPG last night will be delighted to hear about that. The funding to attract young women to the industry is also welcome.</p><p>It amazes me, as a computer science graduate, that we still have a problem in attracting enough young people&#8212;including young women&#8212;to study software engineering. It is a fantastic career, with median salaries in Scotland at around &#163;38,000, and there is plenty of scope for people to develop their careers in almost limitless ways, constrained only by the limits of their own creativity. The opportunity to work in many locations throughout the world is also a real possibility.</p><p>Providing faster networks, connectivity and cabling will certainly take Scotland into the modern digital world, but, in order to go further and become that world-leading digital nation, we will need something more than just the best infrastructure. We have to make it easy for our citizens to get online, and we must offer them the skills so that they can use the software that is there. We have to make the software itself easy to use for both able-bodied people and disabled people.</p><p>Perhaps even more crucially, we need to think about opening up access to the internet for staff and employees at work. There are far too many examples of people being denied access to the internet and software at work. In my view, that hampers progress towards our goal of being world class.</p><p>The pace of change in new technology and software applications is such that we should positively encourage people to use what is out there. We should trust people to act responsibly and give them the freedom to learn and discover. Everyone will gain from that&#8212;and then watch us take off as a world leader in the coming years.</p><p>I am delighted to support the motion.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Developing Skills for Scotland&#8217;s Digital Economy"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13968.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13968", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Willie Coffey", "member_id": "80471", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Willie", "last_name": "Coffey", "left_house": "2011-03-23", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13968.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13968", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Willie Coffey", "member_id": "80297", "entered_house": "2007-05-03", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Kilmarnock and Loudoun"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Christine", "last_name": "Grahame", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>I support the motion and reject the amendments, which in short say that the union is everything good and that independence is everything bad.</p><p>As for Alison McInnes&#8217;s amendment&#8212;which I like; well, I like Alison, not the amendment&#8212;it is a bit like &#8220;War and Peace&#8221;. I never got to the end of that and I never got to the end of her amendment. I have never seen such a long one in my life.</p><p>I must start by declaring that I have had careers as a secondary teacher, a solicitor and a politician, which flows from having a privileged background. I was privileged to have enlightened parents who made it clear from the start that, although I came from a working-class family with five children living in a council house scheme, I had the same rights to opportunities as the children in the bungalows round the corner who went to Edinburgh&#8217;s fee-paying schools.</p><p>I was privileged not to pay tuition fees, and because of my family&#8217;s circumstances I had a grant. I was also privileged to have a grant to live away from home&#8212;although I attended the local university&#8212;because there was nowhere to study in a house with so many children. Thanks to the SNP, tuition fees have gone, as they should, although parental encouragement, as always, remains vital.</p><p>I welcome the progress that has been made over the decades in erasing the image of women&#8217;s place being&#8212;to put it crudely&#8212;in the home, by the kitchen sink. However, the erasing is not complete, and that progress is far too slow. I, too, admire Barbara Castle, but we have to look to the progress of Westminster in bringing in equalities to know glacial progress when we see it. I do not have as much time as Jenny Marra has.</p><p>That image is not fully erased, of course. The image of the young woman or, indeed, any woman&#8212;their shape, size, dress sense and so on&#8212;still plays too large a part compared with that of the male species. Even politicians do not escape. Who cares about kitten heels? I dress for me and me alone.</p><p>The educational choices have not changed much, either. When I was at school, a girl who studied maths, physics and chemistry&#8212;which I did&#8212;was a rarity. Biology and botany were the much more frequent and, indeed, acceptable choices. Things seem to me to be much the same now. Engineering was a female-free zone and, decades on, change is not substantial.</p><p>For example, I note from the Engender briefing that far and away the greater percentage of women in the workforce are in public administration, education and health, as has been said. That may reflect the talents of women in those areas, but there is more at work there. Not all responsibility can be placed on Governments either here or at Westminster or, indeed, on the education system. From the very start&#8212;from education onwards&#8212;opportunities for women take a certain path.</p><p>There is also the issue of the constraints that are put on careers opportunities beyond that educational path. Many of those constraints&#8212;although they are not the exclusive constraints&#8212;are children, lovely though they are. Although a potential employer cannot overtly ask a female applicant a question about having children in the future, I have no doubt that that is a consideration at the back of the mind of some employers that will influence whether to offer the job.</p><p>For those with children, it is changed days from when women&#8212;myself included&#8212;were expected to and did stop work until the children reached school age. Things are much better now. There are statutory obligations on employers and, of course, the significant importance of free childcare hours. The situation could be better, but it is much improved under this Government and would be much improved if we had full control of our revenue and tax system and gave women in particular, although not exclusively, freedom to have a life with time for work and family.</p><p>At the end of the day, if a person has happy and contented children who are growing into responsible adults, whether that person has opted for full-time or part-time work or full-time parenting, that is, for me, an achievement. That is a measure that really counts and which society will benefit from in countless ways.</p><p>The pay gap and the continuing glass ceiling on which many of us&#8212;myself included&#8212;have bumped our heads are, of course, inexcusable. I have twice changed career direction because women who were already employed told me of the limitations that were imposed on them. I am not in favour of statutory gender balance because I reject anything that approaches tokenism, but I refer to the dearth of women in high places.

Some beekeepers recommend that the queen&#8212;not Her Royal Highness, that is, but the queen bee&#8212;is changed every year.</p><p>I am launching a plea and a criticism at one and the same time. The big question is why the Scottish Parliament hives were not populated by the indigenous and under threat Scottish black bee, which I am advised was wrongly labelled as aggressive. Not all things Scottish are aggressive. I have a proverbial&#8212;wait for it&#8212;bee in my bonnet about this. The minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment know that, because I corresponded with them some time ago on this matter on behalf of apiarists in my constituency, in particular Joyce Jack of Peebles, who is secretary of the Newbattle Beekeepers Association and my unofficial tutor in all things bee connected. She alerted me to and educated me on the threat to the indigenous species from imports. Mrs Jack is in the gallery today, so I must be particularly careful with my facts.</p><p>As in &#8220;Blackadder&#8221;, my beekeepers have a cunning plan, and a good one at that, especially after the decimation of hives a few years back through bad winters and springs. The plan was to provide local beekeepers&#8212;after training&#8212;to increase the Scottish black bee population through breeding queens. That can be done&#8212;you learn something every day&#8212;by artificial insemination, although I think from correspondence with the cabinet secretary Richard Lochhead that it is more coyly referred to as artificial instrumentation.

It need not stop there and I hope that the Scottish Government will again consider the proposal from individual beekeepers.</p><p>In the meantime, although there is a requirement to ensure that imported bees do not import viruses, councils and the public can be encouraged to plant spaces with bee-friendly wild flowers and cultivars, such as buddleia and sedum, to assist not just the honey and bumblebees but the insect population at large.</p><p>Honey is not the only product, of course. My tomato flowers are pollinated by bees and insects and give me fresh and tasty tomatoes, and the bird life in my garden thrives on the supply of fresh insect protein.</p><p>I will mention the referendum. Once the Buckfast bees have outlived their stay or migrated to form another hive, can we give the Scottish black bee a chance?

The 2002 act is UK legislation, but it is not bad because of that; it is good legislation. We should not get into a turf war about whether the Scottish Executive called it one thing and we call it another, as though that makes a whit of difference. The point is that it works.</p><p>I am grateful to Margaret Mitchell for talking about how the process operates, because it deals with criminal and civil matters. Something that has not been mentioned is that if we take money from criminals and use it for good causes, the money cannot be laundered through other processes. The Justice Committee will have a round-table evidence session with the police and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, because money is often laundered through environmental waste disposal. Cashback takes the money out of that system, so it is a good thing all round.</p><p>As others have said, millions have been invested primarily in activities for young people who have not had a good start in life. In Gala in my constituency in 2011, the third-generation synthetic pitch got &#163;500,000 from Scottish Borders Council, &#163;350,000 from cashback, and &#163;100,000 from the Hayward Sanderson Trust. I might not have the exact figures for Duncan McNeil and others, but I can tell them that there is a queue to book those pitches and they are very successful. The important thing is that they also meet stringent rugby head-fall height conditions and have a proper shock pad.</p><p>In Midlothian, the midnight league programme is being run by the Scottish Football Association, Midlothian Council, the community safety partnership, Bank of Scotland, cashback for communities, Adidas and Borders Railway, of all people. More than 1,000 people used it in its first year and it is still growing. I have some local numbers.</p><p>I turn to something that has been missed out a bit; I refer to the improvements that are being made to proceeds of crime legislation, which Margaret Mitchell alluded to. In June this year, proposals have been put forward to strengthen the proceeds of crime legislation and make it faster; to use tougher prison sentences for people who fail to pay confiscation orders; to enable assets to be frozen faster and earlier so that they cannot be disposed of; and to ensure that confiscation orders are in place for those who abscond before they are convicted. As I understand it, the Westminster Government has accepted a range of proposals to speed up the process. The Scottish Government has asked for other measures to be included to ensure that confiscation orders are not stopped as a result of offenders serving default sentences; to create new offences for breach of specific orders during civil cases; and to establish a role of administrator to allow more cost-effective management of property that is held during civil cases. Those are all technical issues, but they are very important if we are to make the best use of the assets that are kept.</p><p>I had not really paid terribly much attention to the cashback for communities small grants scheme. One tends to look at big numbers, such as &#163;350,000. However, the sums that are given out under the small grants scheme are very important, too. They cannot be more than &#163;2,000, but that can make a big difference to whether a club has a football net that stays up, or has footballs, and so on. Little things like that can make a world of difference.</p><p>That scheme supports local volunteer-led groups. They cannot all apply for grants individually because that would lead to a network of administration. The applications are filtered through organisations such as Clubs for Young People Scotland, Girlguiding Scotland, the Girls&#8217; Brigade in Scotland, the Scottish Council the Scout Association, the Boys&#8217; Brigade, Youth Scotland and a network of youth clubs. The minister might be able to tell me how the scheme works, but I presume that an organisation or small club applies for a grant through one of those organisations, which puts it to the Government. The grants have a substantial impact. The partnership that administers the funding has a total of 6,862 groups, with almost 172,000 young people being supported by 26,000 volunteers. There are some numbers that are more than numbers; they are people who are doing better than they would have done without cashback for communities.</p><p>The intention of the cashback for communities small grants scheme was that young people, parents and communities would feel that young people would have exciting things to do other than sitting playing computer games and safe places to go for a range of activities.</p><p>The amounts that are recovered under the scheme vary year by year. There was a bumper year in 2010-11, when the total that was recovered was &#163;25.9 million. That was a big figure but it was because two particular cases&#8212;Weir Group and Anatoly Kazachkov&#8212;boosted the figures to unprecedented levels. Generally the figures are not as high as that. In 2003-04, the figure was &#163;2.2 million and in 2013-14, it was &#163;8 million. I have already said how that money was apportioned to bring in more money.</p><p>I do not know whether the cabinet secretary said this in his speech, but I know that he does not intend to use up all the money within one year just because it is there. Money can be carried forward.</p><p>There can be no member who does not think that this is excellent legislation and that the scheme is a virtuous circle, because the bad boys and girls have their money taken from them as fast as possible and that money is protected so that it cannot be laundered through something else. Instead, the money is put back into the communities. I appreciate that the process might require some tweaking.

I want to go back to Labour&#8217;s track record, which the member mentioned.</p><p>Gordon Brown, the man of the moment, has a track record on pensions. In 2000, he announced that he was raising petrol tax and pensions in line with inflation, but he failed to explain that he was using 3.3 per cent for petrol and just 1.1 per cent for pensions. The result was a basic rise in pensions of 75p per week. No wonder 10 million pensioners were up in arms.</p><p>Jim Hume rose&#8212;</p><p>I ask the member to let me finish this bit.</p><p>Gordon Brown had previous form, which Sandra White alluded to.

There is not a shadow of a doubt that Clydeside Action on Asbestos has made a difference.</p><p>It is pleasing to note that, whatever our political beliefs and party membership, members can unite to support sufferers and attempt to get justice for them, given what they have suffered as a result of not having had a safe environment in which to go to work&#8212;something that we regard as normal.</p><p>It is worth repeating Bill Kidd&#8217;s point that, when discussing the effects of asbestos, it is important that we acknowledge that it was not only those who worked in our factories and shipyards who suffered but whole families, as people were affected when the work clothes were washed and then hung out to dry. No one was safe.</p><p>That is why I support the motion and the proposals by Clydeside Action on Asbestos. It was not just individual workers who were affected by asbestos-related illnesses. Everyone was affected&#8212;men, women and children. Whole generations of Scots have been affected, as well as people further afield.

We supply throughout Scotland to workshops and body shops that repair vehicles.</p><p>I am afraid to say that that gives me, in this young body, more than 40 years of experience in the area. When I worked in the industry, I had to make daily calls to body shops and repair shops. No matter how many times I did that, it did not minimise the feeling when I saw a car that had been damaged in an accident involving a young person.</p><p>My experience tells me that, for the most part, young people take great pride in their vehicles. By and large, their vehicles are well maintained and they have great paint jobs. They are maybe a wee bit gaudy for my tastes&#8212;although, given the ties that I wear, some would probably say that that is the pot calling the kettle black. However, they use extremely flashy colours and they have terrific wheels. I spend a lot of time looking at wheels&#8212;not just legs, I have to say&#8212;and I see that young people clearly take great pride in what they have. It is a great achievement to own and drive a car, and it is a milestone in young people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>From my experience, when seeing a vehicle in a workshop that is completely wrecked, it is sometimes hard to understand how people could have walked out of it alive, whereas another car can have very little damage but turn out to have been involved in a fatality. That applies not just to young people but in general. How does that happen? The reason is that the car stops swiftly&#8212;it maybe crashes into something, although it might not be a big bump&#8212;and the people inside the car collide with each other and suffer head damage, which results in fatalities. From looking at a car that has been in an accident, we can never tell what we are really looking at. People always ask about that&#8212;I assure members that, when I walked into the workshop, I always got the bad story, particularly if the crash involved a woman or young person.</p><p>The statistics speak for themselves. As members have said, young people aged between 17 and 25 make up 10 per cent of licence holders but 23 per cent of drivers who are involved in accidents, more than one in five of drivers who are involved in injury accidents and 24 per cent of drivers who are involved in fatal accidents. That is a rather sad statistic.</p><p>Members have mentioned the idea from the Association of British Insurers of a 12-month learning period. I like that, because the learning period and gaining experience are key factors. However, we should take young people with us on that, and we should not give the idea that a penalty is involved. We could offset that in some way by reducing the age at which people can begin driving from 17 to 16 and a half. That would be a clear message that we are not introducing a penalty but trying to engage with young people to give them the confidence and experience that they need to keep safe. I am sure that young people would buy into that.</p><p>Another measure that is used extensively by insurance companies is the black box that monitors behaviours such as speed, turning and time in the car. It also highlights good and bad habits. It is just like having your mum sitting on the back seat, except it disnae talk back. It certainly reduces accidents and insurance costs. It encourages concentration 24/7 and safe driving. It is possible and practical to introduce it for young drivers across the board, if we can come up with the technology&#8212;actually, we have the technology; the issue is the cost of installing it. That approach would be more palatable for young people.</p><p>The young people I am talking about are mainly males. Girls and women are far better when they are young and old. I know, because we employ a lot of people who drive vehicles. The women are by far the most careful drivers. They get into far fewer accidents and get on with the job much better.

To be quite honest, I might get a bit emotional and might not be able to finish it.</p><p>I was, until recently, a board member of Central Scotland Rape Crisis &amp; Sexual Abuse Centre&#8212;indeed, I had that position for more than 10 years&#8212;but I want to make it clear that I am not speaking on its behalf this afternoon. However, I would like to pay tribute to that organisation and the countless other women&#8217;s organisations who, to a person, are in favour of scrapping corroboration. In fact, if we look at the history of those groups, we will see that one of the main drivers for their formation was the consequences of corroboration; now, ironically, they have to deal with the aftermath of its failures on a daily basis.</p><p>I want to dedicate my speech to a woman called Jean by telling her story&#8212;and I should tell the chamber that Jean is not her real name. Her story will in many ways be familiar to those in women&#8217;s groups who have had similar experiences and who have to deal with the wreckage when personal tragedy strikes.</p><p>Jean was overpowered and raped by a person she knew. The incident was very quickly reported to and acted on by the police. They did not collect the evidence at that time; they did even better than that by using their valuable training and escorting Jean to a hospital where a forensic surgeon immediately examined her and expertly collected the evidence. While the examination was taking place, the surgeon was quietly counselling Jean and offering advice about where she could find and who could offer the vital early services that could support her over what the surgeon knew would be a protracted and traumatic period. Jean was supported through this time by her husband and assisted by Rape Crisis, and she was also sympathetically dealt with by the police while at the same time questioned in detail by them.</p><p>The process lasted months and months. The fiscal service was extremely sympathetic to Jean&#8217;s situation, but the time that it took to reach a conclusion about whether a trial would proceed took its toll. The second worst day of Jean&#8217;s life happened when the fiscal service declared that it could not proceed to trial. The word &#8220;corroboration&#8221; was never used but, as matters unfolded, it became clear that the case had failed because of the lack of corroboration.</p><p>The day that Jean was raped, her life changed but she had others&#8217; support to help her meet the challenges that arose. Sadly, when it was announced that the case would not be brought to court, Jean&#8217;s life as she had known it came to an abrupt end. Although her husband had been supportive throughout, he could not get over the fact that after the attack on Jean and the subsequent thorough investigation there would be no trial. For him, no trial meant no rape. The accusations and mistrust started; the fights became frequent as the blame was put on Jean; and then the marriage ended.</p><p>The depression that had started shortly after the rape deepened into chronic depression as Jean turned to alcohol for comfort. Soon after, her child was taken from her. She became so low and so full of self-loathing that she attempted suicide. In just a few short but horrendous years, Jean had lost everything in her life and although, thankfully, she and her daughter were reunited she wonders what might have been had she lived in another jurisdiction. She had early and excellent forensic evidence; her story was believed entirely by the police; the fiscal service supported her claims; and most people believed that things would have been different if this had happened somewhere else.</p><p>Our justice system is dysfunctional. It has barred tens of thousands of Jeans from justice. I know it; Kenny MacAskill knows it; the victims know it; the forensic experts know it; the police know it; the fiscals&#8217; departments know it; every person who is involved in women&#8217;s groups and works on the front line knows it; even lawyers and judges know it. If we all know it, that in itself is an affront to justice, and we should be thoroughly ashamed. Why does our system recognise barriers to justice but do nothing about them? Surely it must not be the system that makes the verdict. Surely it must be a judge and a jury.</p><p>Jean, if you are listening, I know that you were not heard in your time of need but I pray that, today, this Parliament hears your voice.

As BBC news has pointed out,</p><p>&#8220;Oil industry experts have described it as a &#8216;monster&#8217; field containing an estimated eight billion barrels of oil and some analysts believe oil produced there could see the Atlantic overtake the North Sea as the UK&#8217;s biggest oil-producing region.&#8221;</p><p>Only the no campaign would try to persuade Scotland that oil is a burden and that nuclear weapons, which, as Michael Heseltine admitted last week, have hindered exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels in the west, are an asset.</p><p>Why do we have some of the highest levels of child poverty in the western world? Why are working families relying on food hand-outs? Why is our state pension among the lowest in Europe relative to earnings? Why do people living in an oil, gas and renewables-rich nation suffer fuel poverty? Why have living standards fallen in each of the last five years and why will they not reach 2002 levels until 2009? It is because welfare, pensions, energy and defence policies are controlled by Westminster. To me, it is obvious that decisions that are made in Scotland for Scotland must surely be better for the people living here than decisions that are made elsewhere on our behalf.</p><p>Only with a yes vote can we ensure that Scotland&#8217;s wealth is placed in Scotland&#8217;s hands and used to improve our society. Only with a yes vote can we use the powers of independence to establish policies that are tailored to Scottish needs and create more opportunities for the people who live here, including the nearly 40,000 young people who feel the need to leave Scotland every year. With independence, Scotland would have access to Scottish taxes that currently flow to the Treasury and would cease to pay for Scottish members of Parliament and our share of running the House of Lords or Trident.</p><p>With independence, even relatively small changes could make a big difference. For example, according to aviation industry leaders, the abolition of air passenger duty would double the number of visitors to Scotland within five years, thereby greatly enhancing our international connectivity and bolstering our tourism industry and all the jobs that go along with it. The Scottish Government&#8217;s transformational childcare proposals would lead to increased participation in the labour market, which would further expand our economy.</p><p>The opportunity to make Scotland wealthier is, alone, an argument for Scotland to reassert itself as an independent nation. However, there are consequences of remaining shackled to Westminster. According to Oxfam, Britain&#8217;s five richest families are now worth more than the poorest 12 million people and, in the years ahead, welfare cuts will see more disabled people in Scotland losing disability benefits and more children pushed into poverty. Adam Smith said:</p><p>&#8220;No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable.&#8221;</p><p>Canon Kenyon Wright outlined his concerns about the impact of a no vote in The Scotsman this week. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be fooled by the various vague promises of more devolution. The press called me the Godfather of Devolution. Well, ... I tell you this&#8212;the child has grown up and outgrown devolution, no matter how Max, for two reasons. Firstly, because it leaves crucial constitutional and economic areas to be decided by London. Secondly, because devolution is power by gift; or, perhaps, it is really power on loan, for gifts can&#8217;t be taken back. Power devolved is power retained.&#8221;</p><p>In yesterday&#8217;s Herald, Alan Taylor wrote:</p><p>&#8220;all the fresh, innovative, imaginative ideas have come from those eager for change. They are the ones who want to make a fairer, more equitable society and who have inspired people to become involved in the hope of making that happen. They have made an often selfless investment. The same cannot be said for many on the No side. What they want to do is protect what they have&#8221;</p><p>For those in the yes campaign, the referendum is not about protecting vested interests. It is about Scotland, our country and our people, being all that it and they can be. Colleagues, it is surely time that Scotland rejoined the family of independent nations and set about creating the better Scotland that we all wish to see. To do that, I urge everyone in our country to vote yes on 18 September.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>The cabinet secretary will be aware of the governor&#8217;s statement to the Scottish Council for Development and Industry on 20 January that</p><p>&#8220;The Bank of England, which is a financial technocratic institution, would implement whatever monetary arrangements were decided&#8221;.</p><p>Does the cabinet secretary agree that that neutral position is entirely the right one for the Bank of England to take?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Currency Union (Discussions)"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>I, too, thank the cabinet secretary for his statement.

As the committee&#8217;s convener, I was conscious of the need for close scrutiny. The technicalities of the bill are reflected in the large proportion of committee time that we dedicated to it.</p><p>As members know, the Scotland Act 2012 devolved the power to raise taxes on land transactions and waste disposal to landfill. With the passage of the Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill, important changes to the Scottish taxation landscape will be implemented. The bill makes provision for a Scottish tax system to collect and manage the land and buildings transaction tax and Scottish landfill tax.</p><p>Furthermore, the bill will establish revenue Scotland, which will be a new non-ministerial department.

Perhaps I should sit down now.</p><p>Under the bill, the relationship between the tax authority and taxpayers will be clarified. I am optimistic that the bill creates a strong statutory framework for devolved taxes, clearly defining the duties, rights and powers of the tax authority and taxpayers.</p><p>The framework is strongly underpinned by the principles of anti-avoidance, and the establishment of the anti-avoidance rule will enable the new body, revenue Scotland, to combat avoidance schemes that permit tax advantages. The approach is strongly supported by the Finance Committee and the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth.</p><p>Since the Parliament last debated the bill, the Finance Committee has considered amendments at stage two&#8212;more than 300 of them, as Iain Gray said. That involved a lengthy session with the cabinet secretary and his officials. The cabinet secretary demonstrated the importance of keeping fit as he nimbly responded to the myriad of amendments.</p><p>Many amendments related to minor technical or consequential issues and most concerned the drafting of the bill. For example, there was clarification that members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and National Assembly for Wales, like their Scottish and UK equivalents, are not eligible to stand for appointment to revenue Scotland, and that revenue Scotland must specifically address taxpayers and their agents in providing assistance and information. Tribunal procedures were clarified, in accordance with the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014.</p><p>Other amendments were lodged as a result of the committee&#8217;s scrutiny and recommendations. Of note are amendments to section 10, &#8220;Charter of standards and values&#8221; and section 13, &#8220;Use of information by Revenue Scotland&#8221;. Amendments were agreed to that will further protect taxpayers&#8217; confidential information and ensure that revenue Scotland performs in an ethically sound manner.</p><p>Importantly, the general anti-avoidance framework was simplified following feedback from the committee&#8217;s consultations. Previously, three types of revenue Scotland officer had been proposed, but that has been refined and reduced to one. Revenue Scotland officers will now have the required specialist skills and level of seniority to adequately deal with the matters before them, which will ensure that procedures are dealt with and will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy.</p><p>With the support of the committee and the cabinet secretary, as well as contributors such as the Scottish Trades Union Congress and Unison, further amendments were added to the general anti-avoidance rule. As it is the fundamental cornerstone of the bill, the amendments were carefully considered. In all, the changes will better secure the robustness of the legislation and ensure that it is fair.</p><p>I conclude by restating my firm support for the transfer of financial powers to the Scottish Parliament and by reiterating my thanks to my fellow committee members and all other contributors, notably the bill team and the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth. I believe that the bill is an important milestone that caters for the provision of future tax decisions being made in Scotland. It has been taken forward in a positive way by all parties in the Parliament, which was exemplified by the fact that there were no divisions at stage 3. I am sure that I speak for all my Finance Committee colleagues when I say that the bill has only whetted our appetite for further tax legislation in the months and years ahead.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>I congratulate my colleague Gordon MacDonald on securing the debate.</p><p>The benefits of convenience stores in Scotland are many, as we have heard. Such stores boost employment, allow people to start up and develop their own businesses, enhance the Scottish economy and serve local communities.</p><p>Scotland now has more convenience stores per head of population than any other part of the UK, with one shop per 949 people. Those stores are indeed the lifeblood of many of our communities. Convenience stores employ approximately 1.6 per cent of the Scottish working population.</p><p>The benefit of independent convenience stores to ethnic minorities is greater than for any other group, as 60 per cent of Chinese and 70 per cent of Pakistanis living in Scotland work in small businesses. Asians make up only 2.7 per cent of the Scottish population, but they are a vital asset to the independent convenience store sector. Many independent convenience stores are family businesses, and almost two thirds of those family businesses employ at least one other family member.</p><p>Independent convenience stores, through the hard work of the owners and staff, contribute to economic growth. Industry body the Institute of Grocery Distribution has said that the value of the convenience sector across the UK will grow from &#163;35.6&#160;billion in 2013 to &#163;46.2&#160;billion by 2018. That point is reinforced by the fact that, despite an increase in the number of other retail sector shop closures, convenience stores have not followed the same trend, with growth in the number of shop openings during January to March 2014 of 10 per cent.</p><p>A convenience store can contribute to the local economy. It is important to reiterate what previous speakers, including Gavin Brown and Mr MacDonald, have already said. Convenience stores contribute to the local economy by using local tradesmen, produce suppliers, shopfitters, garages, legal firms and accountancy firms. Added services and facilities in convenience stores may be a crucial reason why the sector is growing. They are very fleet of foot. With developments such as the introduction of click and collect, courier delivery, online shopping return services and secure ATMs, I hope that footfall will increase.</p><p>Independent convenience stores are primarily run by their owners. One third of those are women; one in 10 is under 30; 1 per cent are over 60; one in five has been in business for less than half a decade; and one in five of those business owners owns more than one shop. It is clear that a vast range of people are able to operate and develop their own store. That demonstrates the business opportunities in the sector.</p><p>More than three quarters of owners are of the first generation of their family to own or run a business. That creates sustainable jobs for generations of families as well as others in their community.</p><p>It is, of course, no easy life. Many hours of service have to be dedicated to ensuring customer access for the optimum number of hours, and a reasonable footfall is essential to earn any kind of living, let alone a good one.</p><p>Many consumers appreciate the importance of supporting local businesses, not just because of their proximity. Consumer trust in local shops continues to be consistently higher than that in supermarkets, for example. A survey of more than 7,800 shops run by independent corporate retailers reported that, despite competition from major supermarkets, local shops are</p><p>&#8220;as important to the community as the bobby on the beat&#8221;.</p><p>Customers become familiar with the staff in convenience stores, as Margaret McCulloch pointed out, and people often meet in them for a wee bit of a natter and a gossip. Many people are also attracted by the range and flexibility of the stock that local convenience stores can get in. They aid in developing growth in areas such as employment and the economy, and they have a very positive impact. They are a vital community asset, and they enhance community resilience, socioeconomic wellbeing, and the social value of enterprise and innovation. The importance of town and village shops to the fabric of Scotland should not be underestimated.</p><p>As we have heard, there are storm clouds on the horizon. Profits are being squeezed and there are increased costs, from energy costs to the costs of basic produce. In challenging times for all people in society, it can be very difficult for shop owners to pass on all increased costs to customers. As Mr Brown said, we should therefore look further to reduce the rates burden where that is possible. I am sure that the small business bonus scheme has been a tremendous success&#8212;we know that the Federation of Small Businesses said that, without it, one in six shops would have gone down the stank during the recession&#8212;but we should look to see how we can move on from there.</p><p>I reiterate what Gavin Brown said about smuggling.

Scotland will be a net lender to England.&#8221;</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm quoted from the Finance Committee, but what did Professor Andrew Hughes-Hallet actually say? He said:</p><p>&#8220;Given independence ... Scotland gets to add tax powers to the existing monetary set up. She would therefore be unambiguously better off: more policy instruments to serve the same targets&#8212;instruments that can now be designed to fit Scotland's specific needs, rather than the UK average.&#8221;</p><p>He added:</p><p>&#8220;Facing a tight general election in 2015, it is hard to believe that the UK government would in fact choose to deny a currency union when the consequences would be to make their own constituency worse off, while Scotland was made better off. People don&#8217;t usually voluntarily choose to shoot themselves in the foot.&#8221;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>That is exactly what Professor David Simpson said. Indeed, Dr Jim Cuthbert said that Scotland should be compensated by the UK for all the money that has been taken out of Scotland over many years.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth explored the economic opportunities that would open up to an independent Scotland, but unionist MSPs can say only what we cannot do, or hypothesise about how it would all probably end in disaster. Far better&#8212;they say&#8212;to let Westminster keep calling the shots and for us not to take responsibility for Scotland&#8217;s future into our own hands.</p><p>I have always been puzzled by the fact that many members in this chamber seem to be so unsure of their ability and that of their colleagues that they do not wish to have vested in this Parliament the powers to make Scotland a fairer and more prosperous society. With independence, the ability to make our own choices and decisions in the national interest would become the norm for Scotland, instead of our remaining shackled to a political union with Westminster where different priorities and policies and vested interested are entrenched.</p><p>Independence would improve Scotland&#8217;s economy by providing greater prosperity for businesses and citizens. I will run through some of those improvements. By moving economic decision making to Scotland, we would have greater control of policy making in crucial areas including taxation, employment, immigration, exports and industrial policy, which would provide more opportunities and improve our finances. We could improve the tax system by making it more efficient and effective, and by making it support key growth sectors. We could also collect a fair amount of taxes to fund stronger public services, thereby increasing our prosperity, as was set out in the Mirrlees review.</p><p>There would be opportunities for participation in company structures; improvement of labour relations can improve productivity and economic output. Indeed, productivity can thereby be improved by up to 10 per cent, as Scandinavia has shown. We would have a national convention on employment and labour relations to shape a new policy and to have a fresh start. We would have employee representation on boards to allow workers to contribute effectively, alongside management.</p><p>Independence for Scotland would ensure that we control immigration. The great success of the union in the 50 years since the war was to have net immigration of 2&#160;million Scots. In 1900, Scotland had the same population as the Netherlands. The Netherlands now has a population of 16.1&#160;million. That shows the difference in our economic prospects over those years.</p><p>International students contribute &#163;779&#160;million annually. If we allow more people to come and study here, more would want to stay and build our economy.</p><p>By diversifying manufacturing and investing more in research, Scotland could build on its industrial base. During the 10 years of Tony Blair, 37 per cent of all manufacturing employment in that industrial base was lost in Scotland&#8212;53 per cent was lost in Ayrshire. A Scottish Government would provide greater support for that process than Westminster. Examples of industrial development could include developing the Clyde for renewables activities similar to those that are undertaken at Belfast docks, development of new offshore technologies in the oil sector for international export, and specialisation in Scotland&#8217;s strengths in chemicals, computing, life sciences and so on.</p><p>We need to have full economic powers to develop an ambitious industrial policy and to reverse decades of relative decline under Westminster mismanagement. A yes vote will mean that business would have the full support of a global trading and investment network, there would be greater opportunities to support Scottish small and medium-sized enterprises that want to enter export markets, and there would be a focus on promoting the unique strengths of Scottish business in key sectors.</p><p>In addition, an increase in productivity would help to reduce inequality and the low-wage society, which does not provide the optimal environment for growth.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>We must tackle inequality in the same way that countries such as Norway, Sweden and Denmark have so successfully done.</p><p>I had so much more to say, but I was derailed by the sterling argument.

Something was said at the end there that I absolutely agree with: we are miles apart from the Labour Party and its better together pals in how we want to address the issue of social security, particularly in an independent Scotland.</p><p>At the start of the debate, the Deputy First Minister asked Jackie Baillie two questions about Labour&#8217;s position. She asked what new powers this Parliament is guaranteed to get, if we are short of a yes vote, that would allow us to sort the incomes of disabled women and children. She also asked whether the Labour Party would halt the roll-out of personal independence payments. We did not get an answer to that question. There is no answer, and nobody on the Labour benches answered it, because their answer is no&#8212;they are tied to same Westminster system as their pals in the Tory party.</p><p>That has been clear in this debate. Labour members have huffed and hawed and tried to get around the question using all sorts of things such as the history of the Labour Party, poems and whatever else. The reality is that they support the Tory welfare system. It was just confirmed by Michael McMahon that Labour supports welfare being held within the UK.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>Yes, because Labour would rather have the Tories dismantling the system than have a system here in Scotland that supports and meets the need of people in Scotland.</p><p>Speaker after speaker has talked about the failed welfare state that is clearly no longer meeting the needs of our most vulnerable citizens. We all see examples of that every day. I see a UK Government bringing out measures that have little or no support in Scotland and that, as Alison Johnstone said, we are powerless to stop. The Scottish Government does not have the power.</p><p>We will always do what we can to mitigate the worst of the reforms, and Jamie Hepburn outlined a number of the issues that we have taken up. We have a strong record in taking action and have backed it up with as much funding as we can muster under the constraints of a devolved block grant. However, mitigation is simply softening the blows of Westminster. That is not enough for me&#8212;our people deserve more than that. The Scottish Government&#8217;s ambition for Scotland is much higher than that. We have an ambition for Scotland.</p><p>The Government has set out a clear vision for welfare in an independent Scotland. We will halt the roll-out of the discredited universal credit. We will replace personal independence payments with a benefit that ensures that people who have a disability are treated with dignity and respect. We will abolish the bedroom tax. We will increase the carer&#8217;s allowance. We will increase benefits and the minimum wage in line with inflation.</p><p>As the Deputy First Minister said in her opening remarks, Scotland is a wealthy country. Currently, however, social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP is lower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, and low in comparison with the rest of the European Union. We can afford to do things differently.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s vision for social security in an independent Scotland is one in which we all contribute, just as we all receive help and support from the welfare state throughout our lives. We recognise that we all have a role in supporting and sustaining the system for future generations.</p><p>Through devolution, as John Mason mentioned, Scotland has responsibility for education and skills but not for employment, tax or welfare policies. The majority of the people of Scotland want the Scottish Parliament to have control of welfare. All three of those areas are crucial to supporting people into sustained employment, and I think that we all agree that sustained employment is the route out of poverty.</p><p>We make clear in &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221; that, when people can work, they should work. In any case, we believe that the vast majority of people want to work, and the expert working group came to the same conclusion. Work is important for people&#8217;s wellbeing just as much as for their prosperity.</p><p>We heard today about the increase in the level of in-work poverty, which shows that the equation that work is a route out of poverty is not always true. That is why we support measures such as the Scottish Government&#8217;s social wage and the living wage, which will make a real difference to the people of Scotland. We are leading by example in ensuring that all the staff who are covered by the public sector pay policy are paid the Scottish living wage.</p><p>Those who, for whatever reason, cannot work should be helped to lead rich, fulfilling lives. Our call for dignity and respect to be maintained contrasts directly with the UK Government&#8217;s approach, and now it contrasts clearly with the Labour Party&#8217;s approach. Labour&#8217;s approach, as shown by measures such as the current policy on sanctions, does little for people&#8217;s self-respect and self-esteem.</p><p>Those policies do little to provide people with the support that they need, and Scottish Government research has shown that the most disadvantaged are particularly vulnerable to being sanctioned.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>That is a ridiculous argument. We recognise that the policies are not helping people throughout the UK, but we want to do something about it here in Scotland, and we have an opportunity to do so on 18 September.

We have heard today that 100,000 disabled people could lose between &#163;1,000 and &#163;3,000 a year as a result of the change from DLA to PIP. Again, there is no response from the Labour Party on that&#8212;it is simply tied to its Tory allies on the matter.</p><p>Jackie Baillie has been asked on several occasions whether the Labour Party will reverse the change to PIP. We have had no answer, and that is because the answer is no.</p><p>We have to remember that Labour has signed up with its Tory and Liberal pals to welfare reform. It has signed up to continued austerity, to universal credit and to the UK welfare reforms that will put 100,000 more children and 100,000 more disabled people in poverty. Jackie Baillie is shaking her head and saying that that is nonsense. She has had the opportunity today to tell the people of Scotland what Labour is going to do about welfare reform, and she has not done so.</p><p>For me, the issues around benefits and welfare reform crystallise the clear choice that we have to make in September. The choice is between a future in which some of the most important decisions about our country are made by Westminster Governments whether Tory or Labour&#8212;and, in the Tory case, Governments that are often not elected in Scotland&#8212;and a future in which the people of Scotland have the power to determine our own course and have responsibility for making the most of our extraordinary potential.</p><p>That is what independence is about. It is about making that choice for the benefit of the people of Scotland. It is about grasping the opportunity to make things better. We all agree that the welfare system is not working, and we have made proposals to make it better, with real change for the people of Scotland, but the Labour Party cannot accept that&#8212;it would rather stick with its Tory alliance.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>I will wind up.</p><p>The only way in which to get a welfare and social security system that is fair, that treats people with dignity and respect and that meets the needs of the people of Scotland is to vote yes on 18 September.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>Our target is to deliver 30,000 additional affordable homes during the current session of Parliament.

The Government will continue to do that and to work with our local authority partners. However, at the end of the day, it is up to local authorities to determine the type of houses that they require for their areas. Each local authority knows best what is needed in its local community.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Affordable Housing Supply Programme"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s policy is to end the right to buy. It is a policy that the majority of stakeholders support; I am grateful for that support.</p><p>More than 450,000 homes have been sold under the right to buy, which has been a major cause of housing shortages in many areas. Lots of people choose to rent in the social sector, but for others it is their only option. We want to do everything possible to ensure that social rented housing is protected for those people and for future generations. Ending the right to buy will preserve valuable social housing, increase choice for tenants and people who are on waiting lists and help to ensure social housing&#8217;s role in mixed-tenure communities in which people want to live.</p><p>Again and again, stakeholders have told us that they support the policy. Tenants have told us of the damaging impact that the right to buy has had on the social housing sector, and social landlords have told us how ending the right to buy will help them with their planning and stock management. Yet, in the face of all the evidence saying that the right to buy has had its day and has no place in the Scotland that we want to build, Mr Johnstone continues to call for that outdated and unpopular policy to continue. That can surely only be because of his party&#8217;s historic attachment to the right to buy. However, surely even he must accept that it flies in the face of what is best for landlords, tenants and the community as a whole.</p><p>Our ending the right to buy does not mean that the Scottish Government does not support home ownership: far from it. However, we do not have to keep losing housing stock in order to help people to get on the housing ladder. We are committed to helping people into home ownership in other ways, and we support a range of schemes to achieve that. I therefore invite Mr Johnstone to seek to withdraw amendment 38 and not to move amendments 71 and 73.</p><p>Amendment 39 seeks to remove section 2 from the bill. That section has nothing at all to do with ending the right to buy; it simply clarifies two provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2010. The section protects the right to buy of existing tenants who move to new-supply houses in circumstances that are outwith their control. It also makes it clear that people who lived in social housing before 2 March 2011 and who later became tenants should be treated as new tenants. That was always the 2010 act&#8217;s intention, but the provision could have been open to misinterpretation. The bill is simply the first legislative opportunity that we have had to tidy those matters.</p><p>Amendment 72, which Mary Fee lodged, would reduce from two years to one year the notice period before the right to buy ends. I share her wish to stop as soon as is reasonably possible the sale of socially rented homes. Most stakeholders told us that they wanted that, too. That is why I lodged a stage 2 amendment to reduce the notice period to two years from the three years that we originally proposed.</p><p>I know that Mary Fee disagrees with me, but I do not consider that a period of one year would be fair to tenants. If the notice period were to be reduced to one year, the risk would be that tenants could be rushed into buying something that they cannot afford and that is not right for them. It is important that tenants have time to read the guidance that the Scottish Government will produce, to consider their options and to obtain reputable financial advice.</p><p>I will raise one more thing about the notice period. It is important to take into account European convention on human rights considerations. Tenants must be given a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise their right to buy before it ends. A minimum notice period of two years is fair and reasonable. For those reasons, I cannot support amendment 72.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>I will begin by speaking to amendments 1 and 2. As I said at stage 2, I understand communities&#8217; wish for priority to be given to the housing needs of local people but, as I have previously explained, landlords can already take account of the fact that someone lives in a particular area and can give priority to local people, and some landlords do so.</p><p>Amendment 1 would require all social landlords to give reasonable preference to applicants with a local connection, regardless of local circumstances. I believe that it is better for landlords to have the flexibility&#8212;as they do at the moment&#8212;to take local connection into account if they consider that that is right for their area. That more flexible approach is very important for those landlords who provide housing for a particular client group, such as elderly people or veterans, for whom local connection is not always a relevant factor. Those examples illustrate that making local connection a reasonable preference category in legislation would remove a flexibility that is necessary in some cases.</p><p>Amendment 2 would allow landlords to take into account the length of time for which an applicant had been resident in an area when they allocate social housing. As I have said, I understand the wish for priority to be given to the housing needs of local people, but that must be balanced against the needs of all applicants. Landlords can already take local connection into account and can consider how long an applicant has been on the housing list. I am concerned that taking into account the length of time for which an applicant has lived in an area could make it more difficult for people to move when they have good reasons for wanting to do so.</p><p>Overall, I think that there is sufficient flexibility in the current arrangements, and I do not think that amendments 1 and 2 are the right way forward. Therefore, I invite John Lamont not to press them.</p><p>Jackie Baillie&#8217;s amendment 40 would remove &#8220;unmet housing needs&#8221; from the definition in section 3 and instead would require that the circumstances for unmet housing needs should be prescribed in guidance. As Jackie Baillie said, the committee considered an identical amendment at stage 2, when I argued that having the definition on the face of the bill makes it clear that allocations should focus on addressing cases of unmet needs and that a landlord&#8217;s reasonable preference categories should give priority to that. That remains the Government&#8217;s position.</p><p>As Jackie Baillie also said, I met her to discuss that and other points that she had raised. We discussed the steps that we can take to ensure that there is reasonable consistency in the way that landlords assess unmet housing needs. Jackie Baillie and Homeless Action Scotland argued that tying the assessment to local housing strategies would help to achieve consistency. After the meeting, I wrote to Ms Baillie to confirm that section 4 of the bill requires social landlords to have regard to the Government&#8217;s guidance on allocation policies, so the guidance is statutory. I also advised that section 4 requires a landlord to have regard to local housing strategies in developing its allocations policy, and that the Government will use the statutory guidance on allocations to highlight that duty.</p><p>Jackie Baillie was also interested in how the impact of the new provisions on allocations will be monitored. The independent Scottish Housing Regulator is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the performance of all social landlords. It does so by reference to the Scottish social housing charter, in which the Government has set the outcomes and standards that landlords should meet, which include outcomes on housing options and access to social housing. The Government will use the regulator&#8217;s reports for evidence of how the new arrangements are working.</p><p>I hope that the outline that I have provided reassures Jackie Baillie and that she will be content not to move amendment 40. If she does so, I invite the chamber to reject it.</p><p>Alex Johnstone&#8217;s amendment 41 would reintroduce section 5 into the bill. That would allow landlords to take age into account in the allocation of social housing. I explained in detail at stage 2 my reasons for lodging an amendment to remove section 5, and my position has not changed.</p><p>Section 5 provoked a strong reaction. Landlords were keen to have flexibility to manage their stock effectively. Others, such as Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, were concerned about the potential for discrimination against young people. I discussed the conflicting views with stakeholders. Having carefully weighed up all the arguments, I decided to remove section 5 from the bill.</p><p>I was concerned about the possibility of some groups, such as young people, being unintentionally discriminated against, and I was simply not prepared to run that risk. I am very much aware that antisocial behaviour can cause nuisance and distress to neighbours and communities. That is why I am introducing measures under the bill that will provide landlords with additional tools to tackle antisocial behaviour.</p><p>As I said at stage 2, there is more scope for sensitive lets to be used by social landlords. Officials will work closely with landlords to develop guidance to provide more advice on how sensitive lets can be used effectively in allocations. Removing section 5 was the right thing to do, and I do not support amendment 41, which seeks to reintroduce it.</p><p>The stage 2 equivalent to Mary Fee&#8217;s amendment 42 was discussed in committee. I completely understand what Ms Fee is trying to achieve, and why. It is not clear, however, how amendment 42 would work in practice to deliver the outcomes that Mary Fee seeks.</p><p>The amendment refers to</p><p>&#8220;effects ... on the sustainability of particular localities or communities&#8221;,</p><p>but it does not define what is meant by &#8220;sustainability&#8221;. I am concerned that, with no proper definition, the provision would mean different things to different people, and would place landlords in an almost impossible position when they had to interpret and apply it.</p><p>Different landlords, through different interpretations, could end up applying the provision in very different ways, leading to highly inconsistent and potentially unfair outcomes for people seeking housing in different areas. I do not believe that that is what Mary Fee seeks, but it is what is likely to happen.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>I will cover the point that Mary Fee has raised.</p><p>There is a problem with landlords having to reconcile conflicting interests. The fact that the main stakeholders are divided&#8212;as Patrick Harvie mentioned&#8212;on the merits of amendment 42 suggests that it is unlikely to achieve what Mary Fee is seeking. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations supports it, but Shelter and the Glasgow and West of Scotland Forum of Housing Associations oppose it. However, landlords can take account of the overall circumstances, including an individual&#8217;s housing needs and the housing options that are available, when making allocations.</p><p>As I said earlier, we will work closely with stakeholders and landlords to ensure that that is included when we make guidance on sensitive lettings and local letting initiatives, which we will develop through consultation. The guidance will illustrate the flexibility that is already open to landlords. I believe that that is a more effective means of achieving what Mary Fee and all of us want.</p><p>I lodged amendment 4 because of an issue that Mary Fee raised at stage 2. I was happy to do so at this stage, because I agree that it is right that tenants should have enough information to challenge a landlord&#8217;s decision to convert their tenancy, if they want to do so.</p><p>Amendment 4 provides for that by requiring social landlords to set out a number of things in the conversion notice: first, details of the behaviour of the tenant or other person that the landlord has taken into account; secondly, the reasons why the landlord is serving the notice; and finally, information about the tenant&#8217;s right to appeal.

Nothing in the bill or in the operational detail of the tribunal will affect that.</p><p>Tribunal committees will have a legally qualified chairperson, who will have the expertise to ask questions and seek further information to help parties to make the best of their case. The intention is to set up a system in which most people do not need legal representation, although I am absolutely conscious that some people might need assistance to present their case effectively. I am aware that some cases could raise complex issues and that the subject matter is of a serious nature, particularly when the result could be someone losing their home.</p><p>We will consider the most appropriate form of support for parties as part of considering the operational detail of the tribunal. Those issues will be taken into account. Access to justice is at the heart of the process, and we want to allow people to access the tribunal system. We expect that support could be delivered through the provision of funding for legally qualified representation or through the provision of some form of lay representation. When we are setting up the way in which the tribunal operates, we will certainly consider that.</p><p>There is nothing in the bill that prevents legal representation for people.

Significant changes have been made to the regulation of the private rented sector since 2006, including those proposed in the bill. The regulation of letting agents will have a positive impact on letting and property management across the sector.</p><p>I reassure Mr Harvie that I remain open to issuing a letting agents code at some point in the future if it would genuinely enhance the existing controls that are in place.

Landlord registration was not introduced for that purpose.</p><p>Local authorities already have powers to tackle antisocial behaviour in properties that are let for holiday purposes. For example, under part 7 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004, local authorities can serve an antisocial behaviour notice on a private landlord where an occupant or visitor engages in antisocial behaviour at, or in the locality, of the house.</p><p>In a landmark case last year, the City of Edinburgh Council successfully used existing legislation to apply for a management control order for two party flats in Grove Street. That enabled the council to assume all landlord responsibilities for a period of 12 months. I expect other local authorities to use the existing legislation to take similar action where antisocial behaviour in holiday lets is causing difficulties.</p><p>Amendment 48 is the same as an amendment that Drew Smith lodged at stage 2. I explained then that the Scottish Government introduced an order in March 2011 that gives local authorities the powers to deal specifically with the problem of antisocial behaviour in properties that are let for holiday use.</p><p>I have already highlighted City of Edinburgh Council&#8217;s success in using existing legislation to tackle the issue, and I do not consider that amendment 48 is necessary.

However, there are two difficulties with that. First, landlords would have only a year from the commencement date to arrange inspections, and the provision would not recognise any inspections that had been carried out before it came into force. That would cause practical difficulties for landlords and electricians, and it would likely discourage landlords from carrying out any planned inspections in the period prior to commencement. That would be worse for tenants and contrary to the intention of the original amendment.</p><p>A transitional provision is still required, but I intend to use the general power in section 85(5) to make the commencement order for section 22B. That approach will allow time to work with stakeholders and develop a provision that will avoid delay, protect tenants and be fair to landlords.</p><p>I have written to Bob Doris about amendment 6, and he has indicated that he supports the approach. The Electrical Safety Council and the Scottish Association of Landlords, two of the key stakeholders whose submissions encouraged me to support Bob Doris&#8217;s original amendment, have also indicated their support.</p><p>Amendment 7 seeks to introduce a provision on energy efficiency standards in private rented sector properties. Claudia Beamish lodged a similar amendment at stage 2, and I acknowledge that she has sought in this new amendment to address one of the concerns that I expressed at that time. However, several issues remain that mean that the amendment is unnecessary and inappropriate.</p><p>Under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 and the Energy Act 2011, Scottish ministers already have powers to introduce minimum standards for energy efficiency in private sector housing, and we have made very clear our commitment to improving energy efficiency to help address fuel poverty and reduce carbon emissions from housing. For example, central Government spend in Scotland in the past financial year is higher than that elsewhere in the UK at an average of &#163;36.48 for each low-income household in Scotland compared with only &#163;3.52 in England. We are working with stakeholders including environmental, fuel poverty, local authority, private rented sector and consumer interests to identify proposals for minimum energy efficiency standards for consultation in spring 2015.</p><p>Although amendment 7 extends the timescale, it would still constrain the time available to understand properly the issues identified by the working group, particularly on the level of regulation that is technically feasible and appropriate, and to conduct supporting research. Consultation on the Scottish Government&#8217;s sustainable housing strategy also strongly indicated the need for a sufficient lead-in time for the sector to prepare for minimum standards.</p><p>My amendment to enable the repairing standard to be amended by regulations, which was agreed to at stage 2, provides the means to vary the repairing standard. After appropriate consideration and consultation, we think that this is the most effective way to regulate the private rented sector. For those reasons, I do not consider that amendment 7 is necessary or that it would achieve the desired purpose.</p><p>Amendment 46 seeks to make landlords in breach of the repairing standard if they fail to pay for their share of work to common parts, and makes such a failure a criminal offence. Private landlords are already required to meet the repairing standard, and that requirement can be enforced by an application to the Private Rented Housing Panel by a tenant and, under the provisions introduced by the bill, by a local authority on behalf of a tenant. In addition, an owner of a tenement can already enforce a majority decision of owners about repairs against any other owner under the tenement management scheme.</p><p>Amendment 46 would also make repairs that are not required under the repairing standard, such as repairs to common entry systems or common public lighting that is inadequate but not in serious disrepair, matters that can be brought before the Private Rented Housing Panel. I do not think it appropriate to widen the panel&#8217;s remit and require it to adjudicate in disputes between owners instead of dealing with matters that are set out in legislation on behalf of the tenants.</p><p>Amendment 47, in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, seeks to specify two additional types of person who may apply to the Private Rented Housing Panel for a determination in respect of the repairing standard. The bill enables local authorities to make such applications, and new inspection powers that are part of the third-party reporting provisions support the strategic role that local authorities play in ensuring that properties across Scotland meet minimum standards. The bill also enables ministers to make an order extending the range of bodies that can make applications in future, if that is considered useful.</p><p>However, I believe it important first to allow local authorities the time to exercise the bill&#8217;s new powers to tackle poor standards in the private rented sector. Consideration of the effective use of third-party reporting powers by local authorities once the provisions are implemented will indicate whether there is any justification for expanding the powers to additional types of person.</p><p>I believe that the bill strikes the right balance in allowing local authorities to make the applications and granting a power to ministers to broaden access to the Private Rented Housing Panel through secondary legislation, if that is considered necessary and appropriate in the future.</p><p>I move amendment 6.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/25078.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "image_width": 99, "person_id": "25078", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Margaret Burgess", "member_id": "80475", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Cunninghame South"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Jackie", "last_name": "Baillie", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>This has been an interesting debate.

We delivered the twinning of parliamentary constituencies to ensure that equal numbers of men and women stood as candidates. That was not easy, but we have delivered 50:50 representation for men and women as Labour MSPs in almost all Scottish Parliament elections. I will work with the other parties to encourage them to achieve the same figures. It is not enough for us just to be here; it is what we do that makes a difference.</p><p>Across the United Kingdom, it was Labour&#8217;s progressive politics that delivered the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Equality Act 2010 and much more besides. When we see that the gender pay gap remains persistently large, it is clear that there is more to do. However, that is not simply a constitutional issue; it takes political will.</p><p>Any progress to increase opportunities for women is absolutely welcome but, to be frank, I have been frustrated because the past few years have been characterised not by increasing opportunities but by opportunities missed. The reduction in college places represents a missed opportunity. As many people have said, the loss of 140,000 college places since 2007-08 undermines the Government&#8217;s objective of ensuring that we have the training and skills for our economy&#8217;s long-term needs. As Jenny Marra pointed out, there is no doubt that that disproportionately impacts on women; 85,000 women have been affected.</p><p>Another missed opportunity concerns payment of the living wage. The Procurement Reform (Scotland) Bill could have delivered the living wage as part of the &#163;10 billion that is spent each and every year on public sector contracts. The living wage could have been delivered to 400,000 low-paid workers in Scotland. Of them, 64 per cent are women, which means that the SNP said no to 256,000 working women.</p><p>No action was taken on zero-hours contracts or equal pay audits, which are all things that I know that the cabinet secretary would acknowledge would make a positive difference to women. They are all things on which the SNP said to women, &#8220;No&#8212;you can&#8217;t have it.&#8221;</p><p>In all those cases, the SNP had the power to do something. The cabinet secretary and other SNP members make great play of not having the powers to do things, as if that was an excuse for not delivering progress. However, progressive politics does not need constitutional change; it needs political will.</p><p>When the suffragettes fought for votes for women, those votes were delivered by political will and not by constitutional change.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>The minister has only recently arrived in the chamber, but he insists on interrupting from a sedentary position.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>The minimum wage&#8212;the vote on which some SNP members slept through&#8212;helps low-paid women and was delivered by political will, not constitutional change.

The SNP has power over childcare now. The Government focuses on hours at the expense of quality and flexibility and it does not deliver for working families. There is an inherent dishonesty about the SNP&#8217;s policy when it gives no costings for its childcare proposals. The SNP does not appear to have done the modelling&#8212;it certainly has not published it&#8212;and it has delayed the date for providing childcare for vulnerable two-year-olds.</p><p>Further, of course, the Government relies on 104,000 mothers becoming economically active but&#8212;guess what?&#8212;there are only 64,000 mothers who fit the bill. It just does not stack up. Forty-thousand women posted missing. I look forward to the SNP policy that encourages more pregnancies to make its sums add up.</p><p>There is another area in which the Scottish Government has the power to act now. How about delivering more women in the boardrooms of Scotland&#8217;s public bodies? About five or six years ago&#8212;I will be corrected on the timescale&#8212;the Scottish Government set a target of 40 per cent of applications coming from women. It failed to meet even that target, which, again, was for applications only. Less than a third of board members in Scotland are women. Some public bodies have no women on their boards at all. All those appointments are made by the cabinet secretaries, so why have they not delivered? I am much more ambitious than just wanting 40 per cent of applications coming from women; I want to see bums on seats&#8212;I will just check with the Presiding Officer that I am allowed to say that.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>Labour is committed to 50:50 representation on all public boards, and we will act to deliver just that.

It is not just those who are unemployed who need help. There are increasing numbers of people at food banks who are employed but in low-paid jobs.

We may recently have forgotten, but the early days and years of devolution were marked by a sense of common purpose and a willingness to work together.</p><p>The huge expansion of nursery education, the introduction of free personal care and the growing self-confidence that allowed us to ban smoking in public places are all products of devolution&#8212;not of independence, I note, but of devolution within the United Kingdom.</p><p>In fact, it struck me in passing&#8212;SNP backbenchers may find this hard to believe&#8212;that there was also a time when John Swinney, Nicola Sturgeon and their Cabinet colleagues were among the staunchest advocates of a strong Scottish Parliament holding a potentially overbearing Executive to account. How times change.</p><p>However, that train of thought took me, like Patrick Harvie, straight to the very moving celebration of Margo MacDonald&#8217;s life, and in particular to her parting message, which was read by her husband Jim Sillars, appealing for&#8212;whatever the result of the referendum in four weeks&#8212;divisions to end, and for us as a nation to seek unity of purpose.

Labour and SNP members of that committee are united in our frustration that UK ministers seem to be deliberately in denial about that link, but it is difficult to see how the SNP offer on welfare in an independent Scotland differs from what Labour proposes.

I hope that the minister and my front-bench colleague Mark Griffin feel suitably guilty at the gaps in our defence that were highlighted by their absence.</p><p>That annual fixture has, in addition to allowing us as parliamentarians to show our own support, highlighted the support&#8212;and indeed the affection&#8212;for our armed forces that exists among the wider community, and the footballing community in particular. Football clubs that have supported the fixture in the past include Kilmarnock, Hearts and Alloa Athletic. The latter club, as the minister will know, pursues a policy of granting serving military personnel free entry to home matches.</p><p>This year, we were grateful to Raith Rovers for hosting us at Stark&#8217;s park in Kirkcaldy. As some colleagues may know, Raith Rovers have marked 2014, as the centenary of the great war, by launching a new away strip. It is emblazoned simply with the word, &#8220;Remember&#8221;, and rather than displaying the traditional team colours, it is designed in the green and black of the hunting Stewart tartan that was worn by Sir George McCrae&#8217;s battalion.</p><p>Hearts fans will be well aware of the service and sacrifice of their players who signed up for the original sportsmen&#8217;s battalion in late 1914. Hibs, Falkirk and Dunfermline players joined players from Hearts, as did seven players from Raith Rovers, three of whom were subsequently killed at Passchendaele and elsewhere on the western front. Ten other players from Raith Rovers also enlisted between 1914 and 1918. When one sees those numbers, one thinks about whole teams of our fittest, strongest and most talented young men signing up in defence of our country. It is difficult to do justice to the courage and sense of duty and service that those men displayed.</p><p>I am struck by the desire among those of us who still to this day enjoy the freedoms for which those soldiers fought and died to do what we can to recognise the sacrifice that was made in the past and to support the armed services personnel who are currently serving.</p><p>This weekend, all three services, accompanied by the cadets and by veterans organisations including Legion Scotland, paraded in Rouken Glen park in East Renfrewshire, and local families turned out in their hundreds to watch the flag-raising ceremony and the march past. Every member who has spoken so far in today&#8217;s debate has described in similar terms the events in their own communities, which reveals the strength and depth of that support.</p><p>As well as the act of remembering, what can we do to show support? I will give just one example. I am hosting a reception in committee room 1 tomorrow evening&#8212;I was going to say that it would be after decision time, but that has been postponed, so it will take place during decision time&#8212;for a new scheme that has been set up to support and provide legal support to serving and retired soldiers. The scheme was the brainchild of Wing Commander Allan Steele, who is a constituent of mine. With the strenuous efforts of his wife Linzie, he set up a scheme called AFLA, which stands for armed forces legal action. The scheme has brought together a network of solicitors to provide discounts and advice for soldiers, both serving and retired, and has as its motto, &#8220;For Services Rendered&#8221;, which is a fitting summary for this debate. That is one simple and straightforward&#8212;but, I hope, very practical&#8212;example of what we can do.</p><p>Retired soldiers sometimes need considerable support to function in civilian life, but that support, whether it is for mental health or for finding employment, is not always available. I believe that both the UK Government and the Scottish Government can do more in that regard. For example, Poppyscotland recently found out that, of the 189,000 working-age veterans in Scotland, some 28,000 are out of work. That is twice the unemployment rate among the general population. As members have mentioned, it can be extremely difficult to account for the important and useful skills and experience that soldiers accumulate while serving, which makes finding civilian employment that much more difficult.</p><p>My colleague Jim Murphy, when he was shadow secretary of state for defence, launched a very beneficial scheme to encourage businesses to sign up to a veterans interview programme. The scheme recognised that the skills that are gained in the armed forces are transferable, but often come across better in an interview than in a standard application form. Many businesses, including John Lewis, O2, Celtic, Greggs and Centrica, signed up to the scheme and offered the first step on the ladder for many ex-soldiers. Such schemes are inexpensive to run but make a big difference. I invite the Scottish Government to see whether we can do more in that area.</p><p>SAMH and Poppyscotland highlighted a similar situation in the recent launch of the Employ-Able service, which provides local support, training and practical advice to assist veterans in their search for work. The service involves one-to-one and group sessions covering topics including interview techniques, and offers targeted support where necessary.</p><p>We have talked about the wider issue of the health and wellbeing of former soldiers. The minister mentioned the Prime Minister&#8217;s special representative on veterans affairs, Lord Ashcroft. What I found most interesting from Lord Ashcroft&#8217;s recent research was that nine out of every ten people thought it common for former soldiers to have severe mental health problems and for them to commit suicide. That misconception has a negative impact on the likelihood of former services personnel being hired for jobs or functioning normally in society.</p><p>The ideas that soldiers have no skills, that they are all mentally unwell and that they are unfit for certain jobs need to be challenged. By challenging the stereotypes, we can provide the correct support that those men and women need. Our communities expect us to do that, parliamentarians want us to do that and our armed forces need us to do that.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Armed Forces and Veteran Communities"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>Much as I agree with the general tenor of what Ms Grahame says about older people being an asset to our society, does she not accept that there is an issue about the dependency ratio that we have to face up to? Scotland is going to have a worse dependency ratio than the rest of the UK unless we address that issue.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Older People"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>I join all those who have welcomed the publication of the active and healthy ageing action plan, and I add my thanks to Dr Whoriskey and her team for their work in putting the report together.</p><p>I echo the comments that have been made about the important role that older people play in our communities&#8212;including comments by a number of allegedly, or self-styled, senior citizens in the Parliament. As I will go on to argue, it is only right that our representation reflects wider society.</p><p>The action plan makes a number of very helpful recommendations, which I am pleased that the Government has endorsed. I like the way that the process is framed; it is not framed as a passive process, but as a process of active ageing, which we can shape together, as a society. Dr Whoriskey used the phrase &#8220;age healthily&#8221; in her foreword. That neatly sums up the purpose of the plan and, I had rather naively hoped, the debate, too.</p><p>In many ways, &#8220;old&#8221; is a relative term, of course. In his retirement, my father used to tell us regularly about his visits to so-called older people. We would point out that they were a lot younger than he was. Marie Galbraith was a friend and constituent, who sadly died last year. When she was well into her 70s and 80s, she did much to shape the Parliament&#8217;s Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003, more than a decade back. She once told me that &#8220;Old is 10 years older than you are.&#8221; The refined version is, &#8220;Ten years is older&#8221;&#8212;I am sorry. The refined version is, &#8220;Old is 10 years older than you think you are.&#8221; [Interruption.] I say to Christine Grahame that we have had examples of failing memory already.</p><p>As I have just demonstrated, vulnerabilities go with age, and they simply cannot be ignored. There is not just infirmity or declining physical strength: there are problems such as increasing loneliness and social isolation, which my colleague Margaret McDougall brought to Parliament for debate just last month.</p><p>Technology moves on, and that can be liberating for some older people, but it can become a barrier for others. That is where we have to act; we have to respond to the new challenges. The Government and the Scottish Parliament have to intervene to ensure that we put in place the right protections. A bump in the car for an older person can become a source of anxiety rather than something to be forgotten about; it can turn into a reason not to drive any more. For us, as parliamentarians, that should mean more reason to support the free bus pass, so that people who choose not to drive do not lose their mobility.</p><p>The confidence that comes from maturity and experience&#8212;from a life of work or bringing up a family&#8212;can begin to wane, and that is an opening through which fraudsters and scam artists can thrive. For us as elected representatives, that is a growing threat. We need to respond to it and we need to help to protect vulnerable people from unwanted cold calling and doorstep selling. As MSPs, we are rightly proud of having introduced free personal care for older people, but we should be ashamed to be in office while older people in Scotland suffer the indignity of the 15-minute care visit.</p><p>It is right that we question and debate the costs of our policy choices, but at least as important are the support mechanisms that we put in place, the social and cultural attitudes that we help to shape and the political voice that we hear from older people.</p><p>I will give one more example. There are many retirement complexes in my constituency and, I am sure, in many other constituencies. The properties are owned by the residents and run by property managers, but the relationship between owners and manager is often reversed. I do not know how many times I have met residents who feel intimidated or, which is worse, who fee3l powerless and bullied. Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s Property Factors (Scotland) Act 2011 has, for the first time, created an avenue for complaint, but from my experience, the jury is still out on whether we need to go beyond a voluntary code of conduct.</p><p>As the motion highlights, there is also much that we can celebrate. Last week, I was delighted to host an awards ceremony for local volunteers in East Renfrewshire, along with my Westminster colleague Jim Murphy MP. The event was attended by almost 150 people from all walks of life and of all ages. It was an uplifting, life-affirming and unsullied demonstration of our common humanity&#8212;quite an antidote to the jaundiced cynicism that too often accompanies politics. I heard first hand of many daily demonstrations of kindness and solidarity&#8212;from dementia carers, to bereavement counsellors to environmental campaigners and everything in between.</p><p>Last year, the Royal Voluntary Service found that one older person in five in the UK&#8212;some 2.25&#160;million people&#8212;volunteers for two charities or more. In Scotland, almost one person in five over the age of 75 still volunteers.</p><p>We should not, however, have to justify older people in terms of the economic contribution that they make through hours of caring or volunteering, substantial though that is. A particularly interesting study from University College London last year found that any suggestion that older people are a hindrance to society or a drag on our economy is unfounded. It found that the fact that people are living longer, which is often categorised as a problem&#8212;even by SNP members of the Parliament&#8212;is actually a net benefit to the economy, even taking into account the increasing health service and social care costs. Part of that net benefit includes the increasingly important role that older people play as kinship carers and foster carers.</p><p>The Fostering Network recently analysed a sample of its foster carer members and found that 23 per cent of all carers in Scotland are aged between 60 and 69 and 4 per cent are over 70. The same study discovered that only 6 per cent of carers are aged under 40. Other studies have found similar figures in other caring roles. The University of Bristol recently found that 54 per cent of children in kinship care are cared for by their grandparents; 23 per cent of kinship carers in Scotland are aged over 65.</p><p>I am surprised that that important kinship care role, which has remained hugely underappreciated and undervalued for too long, is not mentioned in the action plan, and that there is no mention of older people being supported to be carers.</p><p>I welcome the debate and the opportunity that it gives Parliament to say with one voice that it enormously appreciates not only the contribution that older people have made to Scotland, but the contribution that they continue to make. Whether working, caring for others or volunteering in every community, older people play an integral part in holding the country together, and we owe them not only a debt of gratitude but all the support that we can provide to allow each of them, and each of us, to age healthily.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Older People"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/25098.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "image_width": 99, "person_id": "25098", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Ken Macintosh", "member_id": "80477", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Eastwood"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Duncan", "last_name": "McNeil", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p></p><p>3.

There was a female convener and deputy convener, and&#8212;I think&#8212;the minister here today was on the committee during the passage of the bill as well. It was interesting for us males on the committee to get the various anecdotes and stories about the issue, but the committee completely shared the ambition of the bill to confirm the rights of the child and recognise clearly the health benefits&#8212;which have been described&#8212;to the mother, the child and wider society.</p><p>The passage of the bill was a real opportunity to tackle the culture and attitudes towards breastfeeding through public debate. It generated a lot of discussion in wider society. However, my desire to speak in the debate was not just for a trip down memory lane to recall the issues. Elaine Smith will be pleased to hear that one reason why I am speaking is that the debate has, yet again, initiated interest and debate in my community.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, I was contacted with an inquiry about this debate&#8212;what it was about, what it would cover and whether the inquirers could come along. I decided to meet those people on Tuesday in Port Glasgow health centre, and I am here as a reporter of the interesting rolling debate that we had in a canteen space at the health centre. It was all women there apart from me and they contributed in between mouthfuls of their sandwiches and cups of tea. There were professional women and lay people there who all gave a view about breastfeeding and the challenges.</p><p>Elaine Smith will be pleased that that debate was triggered by this debate and that people are genuinely interested in how we can make the ambition of her bill and, indeed, Government policy a reality. Elaine Smith might be saddened to learn&#8212;although I am sure that she is already aware&#8212;that about 80 per cent of mothers breastfeed in the affluent areas of a local authority compared to 2 per cent in the less affluent areas. That is a challenge.</p><p>The debate on Tuesday was very fluid and people were encouraged to give their views. I want to do justice to those views by getting them on the record today. Issues raised included the expectations on young mothers and the pressures that they are under these days. The choices that they have must be balanced against those pressures. The lives that they lead are very different from those of their grandmothers, but that puts pressure on them. They do not see themselves as confined by motherhood. They are anxious to get back to work for financial reasons and they want their social lives back, which they perhaps do not see as compatible with motherhood. Those are not my views, I should caution. I am reporting back on the lively debate that took place between laypeople and professionals.</p><p>I have covered the social issues. As has been mentioned, there are fewer midwives. There is perceived to be less support now than there was, although I know that there are schemes for specific groups. Breastfeeding now competes with child protection, smoking cessation and addiction services in the job remit of people who would previously have delivered breastfeeding support. There is a difficult landscape out there. The debate is necessary because breastfeeding needs to get parity with those other issues.

Like others, I have expressed an interest in the cashback for communities programme for some time, through making freedom of information requests and asking questions in the chamber, and through the work of the Health and Sport Committee in respect of the programme&#8217;s accountability and outcomes and the impact that it has on communities.</p><p>We will hear a lot of examples today. I could recite many of the good ideas and good causes in my community. I have supported efforts to get cashback money, which have allowed good initiatives to take place. However, what we are discussing today is the first national evaluation of the programme&#8217;s outcomes. We all agree that cashback is a good idea, but the issue is how it has been working and how it could be made to work better, particularly for those communities that are hard pressed because of deprivation, poverty and associated crime.</p><p>I give a qualified welcome to this long-overdue evaluation of the programme, which has been produced seven years after the programme began, with &#163;40 million already spent. The evaluation does not give us information about which children were reached, which communities were reached, where facilities have been set up and how that will transform that part of the community. It lumps together all the local authorities, when we know that within local authority boundaries there are extremes of crime and poverty; it does not give us any of that detail.

The concerns that I and others have raised regarding the lack of accountability, transparency and clear and consistent objectives in relation to the programme were confirmed in the evaluation. It was put in a very nice way, but the evaluation confirms that Inspiring Scotland had to tell organisations how to produce effective external evaluations of their programmes. Perhaps it would be useful to have some of that explanation here. It had to explain to organisations the difference between inputs, which is the money that goes in, outputs, which is the impact on communities, and outcomes. Goodness only knows what the evaluation found, given that all that had to be explained. The Government has not shared that information with us. I would like to see that information&#8212;in the first report to the Government&#8212;placed in the Scottish Parliament information centre for us all to see.</p><p>We need to learn lessons from the lack of financial accountability and strategy. I am not blaming the sports partners, because if an organisation is presented with money as a windfall and it is not asked to account for it very much, it will use that flexibility. I am not saying that the partners did anything criminal with the money, but did they use it to best effect to meet the objectives that have been set by reaching those communities?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Cashback for Communities"}, {"date": "2014-06-12", "body": "<p>We are saying that an evaluation should be able to show, right down to the postcodes, the communities and individuals who have benefited from the scheme.

There is no doubt that tackling those issues can improve the health and wellbeing of our country.</p><p>Perhaps the committees will have the opportunity to share and even take on some of that work.</p><p>I am interested in aspects of regeneration. The regeneration game has been played in Inverclyde for many years&#8212;Kevin Stewart mentioned 60 years, but it feels longer than that.</p><p>Regeneration has gone through phases. We remember that the private sector withdrew suddenly. At the heart of some of the failings there is the fact that we have not got the relationships right. Constant change will take place in industry, particularly when large numbers of people are employed, but there was no notification, planning, rundown or strategy at the beginning, so communities such as Greenock and Port Glasgow were left with a challenge.</p><p>In the past, there were better times. The private sector led regeneration, because house building was on the go and it could sell houses. The private sector rushed out of the heart of the community in Greenock and Port Glasgow and started to build in surrounding areas. That built up new communities and exaggerated the decline and deprivation in the central areas. The brownfield sites were left for many years.</p><p>Well-meaning Governments of all descriptions have come along and said that the lost jobs need to be replaced with other jobs. They replaced overdependency on shipbuilding jobs with overdependency on electronics jobs, and the cycle began again.</p><p>We have been there and done it. We have seen well-meaning Governments come along with quick fixes. We have seen successes&#8212;for instance, Greenock processes two thirds of RBS&#8217;s mortgages in the United Kingdom. That came from innovation, but too much has not been followed through.</p><p>Influences such as that brought about the urban regeneration company many years later. We can debate whether it succeeded, but in Inverclyde the urban regeneration company tried to avoid the mistakes that had been made in the past&#8212;an issue that Stewart Stevenson referred to earlier. It tried to get away from the quick fixes and establish secure funding over a long period. It tried to engage local authorities and the private sector. It had all those ambitions, but how can it survive when, 10 years into the project, we have pulled the funding? We are making judgments and comparing the declining population and all the past problems in Inverclyde with growth in Inverness.</p><p>The Scottish Government understands regeneration to be</p><p>&#8220;the holistic process of reversing the economic, physical and social decline of places where market forces alone won&#8217;t suffice&#8221;,</p><p>but how can we take seriously its objective of</p><p>&#8220;a Scotland where our most disadvantaged communities are supported and where all places are sustainable and promote well-being&#8221;?</p><p>If the Government believes in that and accepts, as John Swinney and other Government ministers accept, that we are more vulnerable to recession and decline, why has the funding been pulled from the urban regeneration company in Inverclyde? Why has our local college been facing cuts? Why has our housing budget faced cuts?</p><p>We need to get serious about regeneration. I say to Chic Brodie that physical reconstruction matters to those who voted in great numbers to get investment in the housing sector in order to transform their lives and where they live in Inverclyde. All those things were happening and were delivering. It is a different matter to say, when we examine the facts, whether the outcome has been good or bad. We should not have withdrawn the funding completely, but that is what has happened. We believed that we would eventually win the regeneration game only to find, now, that we are losers.</p><p>Notwithstanding that gripe, I think that the report is a serious piece of work that raises issues that need to be raised. We need to do things better. Empowering our communities through regeneration is the only way forward, but we must be consistent and, as Stewart Stevenson says, test it. We must learn from our mistakes but accept that in any project or regeneration there will be success and failure. Our ambition should be for success for communities such as Inverclyde.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, {"date": "2014-05-21", "body": "<p>The cabinet secretary mentioned asbestos cases.

Our day in Orkney was special because of the weather and because I saw a part of the country that I had never seen before. I even managed to photobomb an ancient monument when the convener Stewart Maxwell was taking a picture at the Ring of Brodgar; not many people can make that claim to fame.</p><p>While we were there, I was talking to Liam McArthur when we were walking down to Skara Brae. The centre shows the various time points as people walk towards the village, which was meant to have been started around 3100 BC. I was talking about how Paisley has an 850-year-old abbey but, when Liam McArthur showed me where 850 years ago is in the great scheme of things compared to Skara Brae, it did not look like a lot of time on the planet.</p><p>As Jayne Baxter mentioned, we all have historic things in our areas, and this is where it comes down to a definition of the historic environment. How do we define it? In my opinion, it is pretty fluid. What is part of the historic environment now might not have been 20 or 30 years ago.</p><p>In my town, there are former mill buildings that were just industrial buildings in their time but are now regarded as buildings of great beauty and architectural prowess. Such buildings have to be retained and used, because they are an integral part of who we are, what the town is and what makes us Paisley buddies. It is the same in every single community throughout Scotland.</p><p>That is the exciting part of the idea of the historic environment. Let us not contain it and box it in. Let us not just say, &#8220;That&#8217;s what it is and it doesn&#8217;t move from there.&#8221; The exciting part of the bill is that we can continue to move the historic environment on and find a way to ensure that we can save it for everyone in the future.</p><p>This bill is a good start for us all to work together.

In the first budget, we will provide 600 hours of childcare to approximately half of Scotland&#8217;s two-year-olds, and by the end of the first session of an independent Parliament we will ensure that all three-year-olds, four-year-olds and vulnerable two-year-olds are entitled to 1,140 hours of childcare</p><p>Those are the things that can&#8212;and will, we believe&#8212;make a difference in people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>Independence can give us the powers to invest back into childcare money that will be raised by enabling more women to get back into work.

Although 76 per cent of Scottish MPs voted against further austerity cuts in the 2010 budget, that made no difference and the cuts went ahead; indeed, 81 per cent of Scottish MPs voted against the welfare cuts and the change in the benefits uprating system.</p><p>An old SNP councillor in Renfrewshire for 35 years, Jim Mitchell, who was a friend of mine and has now left us, used to say, &#8220;You&#8217;re powerless if you remain within the Westminster system.&#8221; Indeed, Scotland is powerless if we remain in the Westminster system, because our ambition is bigger than that, and we want so much more.</p><p>The choice in front of us is quite simple.

During the election campaign in 2011, I met people from Gleniffer Thistle boys club, which had received a small grant to enable it to have a football park of its own. James Dornan has already mentioned difficulties in accessing football facilities. The club secured the park using a basket of funding measures, of which cashback was one. The First Minister attended the opening of the facility.</p><p>The club has produced footballers who have played at a senior level, including legends such as St Mirren&#8217;s own Barry Lavety, Steven Thomson and current Aberdeen manager and Paisley boy Derek McInnes, whose only unfortunate credential is that he played for Greenock Morton at one point&#8212;I will leave that for one of my colleagues to mention later.

That facility was not available to that football club in the past, so I think that I will stick to the positive nature of that.</p><p>Only last week, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice announced that one of six successful applicants was Castlehead high school&#8212;in Paisley, in Renfrewshire. That funding will build on funding that it got previously to create an SFA school of football excellence, which is also a great scheme. We have managed to get many young people involved in that, participating as referees and players and having healthy lifestyles. Those are all examples of the scheme working. Hopefully, the young men and women who are playing football in Castlehead high school can follow in the footsteps of another well-known Paisley buddie, Archie Gemmill, and score wonder goals in the world cup. Such schemes are all going to help.</p><p>I will make a suggestion&#8212;we could call it a pitch&#8212;to the cabinet secretary. St Mirren&#8217;s street stuff project has been mentioned by me and other members on numerous occasions. People from St Mirren go out and work in the community and are able to access areas that local authority services and third sector groups cannot access, because they have the credibility that comes from representing the football club. The cabinet secretary is aware of a lot of the work that the club has done in the community, because he has recently visited St Mirren. It goes out into the community and gets involved in street football and it has a gym bus. It also has a mobile venue called the box, which lets people get involved with dancing and DJ-ing&#8212;I am getting a bit old for some of that, although I might try football from time to time.</p><p>The club also runs other projects. It works with a lot of community groups, because it is based in Paisley&#8217;s Ferguslie Park, which is an area of multiple deprivation. It has helped young fathers who have not been able to cook a meal&#8212;the kids go out to play football and, when they come back, dad is in the corporate hospitality area and has made a meal for them. We could maybe take that idea forward. The cabinet secretary recently visited the Dome, which St Mirren financed itself. That shows that it is possible to retrofit what is almost an indoor facility very cheaply.</p><p>Here is the pitch, Presiding Officer. Why do we not take that idea and create a football club-based community hub, which would have credibility in the community? I have mentioned previously that the chairman of St Mirren, Stewart Gilmour, has said to the local authority, &#8220;Why do you not second some of your social workers to me? I will use them to make a difference in the community.&#8221; It is about credibility, becoming part of the community and using the community hub to make a difference to an area. I am sick of hearing that areas such as Ferguslie Park in Paisley are regarded as areas of multiple deprivation. We can use the local football club as an example.</p><p>The project would involve multiple sports. Kelburne Hockey Club&#8212;which, incidentally, has worked with Duncan McInnes, who is the brother of the Aberdeen manager and is involved in hockey&#8212;is one of the best clubs in Scotland. It has got to the stage at which it wants to be part of this and to have a water-based hockey pitch.</p><p>Why can we not use sport as a way not only to take kids off the street to ensure that they avoid antisocial behaviour on Friday nights but to push them so that they get the idea of accessing education, jobs and other things? I am not asking for cashback for communities to pay for all that, although if anybody wanted to do that, it would be fine by me.

The bill does not have any direct impact on Scottish Government policy; the Government is content that it will not have any direct consequences for the general law; and the Government does not have a view on the merits of the proposed site&#8212;that is a matter for the council. However, I recognise the widespread agreement that the current Portobello high school building is not fit for purpose and needs to be replaced. I also recognise that the council has identified land at Portobello park as its preferred site for a replacement building, as well as the concerns of those who do not wish to see the park being used for that purpose.</p><p>None of those issues is for the Scottish Government: they are local issues that should be resolved locally. The only reason why the matter was brought to the Parliament was that, following a decision by the Court of Session, the only way for the council to achieve its preferred option for the replacement Portobello high school was to secure the passage of a private bill.</p><p>An important part of the committee&#8217;s consideration was whether there had been sufficient consultation by the council on its proposals. In its preliminary stage report, the committee concluded that there had been adequate consultation, but also that a number of issues had been raised about the detail of the consultation process. It therefore encouraged the City of Edinburgh Council to reflect on those issues.</p><p>I share that sentiment. It is vital that local people are properly consulted about and able to influence decisions that affect them. I therefore encourage all local authorities&#8212;not just the City of Edinburgh Council&#8212;to consider the points that were made during consideration of the bill and to make any changes to their procedures that may be appropriate.</p><p>In that context, I will say something briefly about the Scottish Government&#8217;s Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill, which was introduced earlier this month. That bill&#8217;s core purpose is to help communities to achieve their own goals and aspirations through ownership of land and buildings and by having their voices heard in the decisions that affect their area. It includes a requirement for local authorities to publish their proposals and consult community bodies before they dispose of or change the use of common good assets. I do not propose a wider redefinition of common good assets.</p><p>There can often be uncertainty about what constitutes common good land or the purposes for which it can be used. The Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill would therefore place a statutory duty on local authorities to establish and maintain a register of all property that they hold for the common good. Taken together, the provisions in the bill would thus substantially improve transparency and accountability in relation to common good land.</p><p>In conclusion, the City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill Committee carefully considered the issues that were raised during the bill&#8217;s progress. In particular, I note that it sought to address concerns about the future of the site by passing an amendment that was aimed at securing that, if the land ceased to be used for educational purposes, it would revert to its original use and status. That is to be welcomed as being true to the core purpose of the bill. However, I look forward to hearing what other members will say this afternoon. I emphasise once again that the Government continues to take a neutral position on the bill.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill: Final Stage"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>Thank you, Presiding Officer&#8212;that is something of a challenge when one has to remain neutral, as is the case with these matters, but I will do my best.</p><p>The debate has been consensual and constructive, and it has focused on a number of areas. First and foremost, we must consider the pupils who are being educated in a building that is clearly no longer fit for purpose. Finding a solution to that problem has been central to everyone&#8217;s consideration.</p><p>It would be remiss of me not to remind members of the new moneys that were announced today to enable further investment in Scotland&#8217;s school estate in partnership with local authorities. The Portobello issue was not necessarily about resourcing, but about the options that were available for a new site.</p><p>In her excellent speech, Siobhan McMahon went into great depth about the factors involved. She talked about how we must separate out all the different considerations&#8212;what is relevant for a planning authority, how a council considers estate management, legal status and people&#8217;s objections and views, which must be in no way dismissed but balanced against the other considerations so that a decision can be taken.</p><p>There are calls to enhance the legislation around common good. We will do that through the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill, but there will be no wholesale revisiting of common good legislation, because I fear that if we tried to rewrite hundreds of years of legislation we would create many unintended consequences. However, greater transparency and community involvement will feature in the bill in the context of common good assets, which run to a value of hundreds of millions of pounds in Scotland.</p><p>There are people in local authorities, for example, who think that common good funds are overly bureaucratic and should be wound up and rolled up into mainstream council funding. I have decided that that is not the appropriate approach. Common good funds are communities&#8217; inheritance and should have a degree of protection.</p><p>For that reason, all members were right to point out that the bill will not set a legal precedent and open a new channel for adjusting common good funds. Any council would have to go through a process such as this one to achieve an outcome such as the City of Edinburgh Council is seeking&#8212;I must restate that from the Government&#8217;s point of view. Like Gavin Brown and other members, I see no great rush from local authorities to come to the Scottish Parliament for similar legislation, even if they aspire to conduct a similar exercise.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale made a number of points. A central point was about the quality of education; she also talked about the need for a thorough approach, which delves into the detail, provides robust consideration and shows determination to make the process work. She said that the Labour Party is not whipped, and Fiona McLeod reminded us that Scottish National Party members are not whipped either&#8212;I do not think that any party has whipped its members, including the Liberal Democrats and our two Greens. Members are free to vote with their heads and, of course, their hearts.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale also told us a very human story to remind us why the new school is so necessary.</p><p>Gavin Brown pointed out that the issue has been contentious and the committee has had a difficult task. As the planning system must do, the committee had to balance different interests in coming to its conclusions. It had to consider public benefit and overall benefit. Gavin Brown also talked about the timescales for the bill and the need to ensure that it received careful consideration.</p><p>Fiona McLeod said that the committee carefully considered all submissions, as we would expect a committee to do. She reminded us that conveners of private bill committees do not have an easy job. I can tell members that it is also difficult for a minister who has responsibility for decisions to do with local government and planning to balance all the different issues. At some point, we must reach a decision and then justify our decision.</p><p>Alison McInnes reminded us that the bill has attracted support as well as objections. She talked about how the planning process for any application sets necessary and relevant conditions, as does the bill. Section 2A, which was inserted by amendment, provides safeguards in relation to future use of the park, which was a key concern of many residents and objectors.</p><p>A number of members expressed hope that, whatever the outcome of today&#8217;s vote, the community and parties involved, including City of Edinburgh Council, can build bridges and reconnect.</p><p>Alison Johnstone talked about the condition of the school building and the need to get the best possible outcome. I have sometimes been a critic of City of Edinburgh Council, but I note what she said about the Greens&#8217; clear view on the outcome of the bill. I am sure that, given their credentials, the Greens will pursue the point about open space, which has been made loudly and clearly.</p><p>I talked about enhancing transparency and community involvement in relation to the common good, and about on-going investment in the school programme. It will be for members to decide what is the right thing to do, having heard the arguments that have been expressed not just today but throughout the past year.</p><p>Today is the day we make a decision, and then we will move on to focus on all the different issues that have been played out. All I can say about the correspondence that I have received is that we as constituency MSPs, Government ministers and members of the individual parties are contacted by very strong campaigns, but we have to decide and come to a conclusion not simply on the basis of numerical gain but on the basis of what is right after considering all the different factors.</p><p>Even if it is inappropriate for me to do so, I will say that having listened to the debate, heard the deliberations and considered the information that has been shared I believe that, whatever members choose to do today, every member who has spoken and expressed such a well-informed opinion has put our collective integrity beyond question on this matter.</p><p>First and foremost in our minds has been ensuring a fair process and an equitable hearing and that the rights and interests of individuals as well as the general public good are pursued. In that sense, I think that the debate has been very constructive and takes us to the conclusion of the bill&#8217;s passage and the vote in which members will make what they think is the right decision for Portobello high school and on the bill that has been presented to Parliament.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill: Final Stage"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>The national calculation methodology for non-domestic buildings currently includes flexibility for 24 types of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, which can be used to provide heating in all types of non-domestic building, including large public buildings.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Public Buildings (Heating Systems)"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>Yes, I will accede to that very reasonable request from Mr McArthur and I will explore all options.

Where there can be national consistency, we want to deliver that. I commit to working in partnership with local government to try to deliver that. I understand that there was a successful meeting with Cabinet Secretary Kenny MacAskill earlier today. We will take forward that consensual approach.</p><p>I hope that the same cross-party attitude that we have enjoyed in the chamber today will be replicated in local government when I have those discussions. I hope that I do not have the experience of finding that a party in Parliament says one thing and the same party in local government takes a different view. Mr Mason had a point in what he said about nimbyism and my planning remit.

It is absolutely at their discretion, so we will work on that regulatory agenda.</p><p>I was particularly interested in Mary Fee&#8217;s personal reflections because she will know my area well. I was raised in Ard Road in Kirklandneuk in Renfrew. Behind the houses on that street there is a playing field where the showmen come to put on the shows in one particular week of the year. I took a great interest in that, and I went to the shows unaccompanied&#8212;without an adult. Alex Johnstone made the point that we sometimes wrap our children up in cotton wool. However, the problem was that I was five at the time, and my family was wondering where I had gone. Such was the attraction of the shows and what was happening there that, while my family was looking for me, I was enjoying myself with the shows, and of course, the people were looking after me very well. That could have been a misdirection in my profession. I have found a happy home in politics, but we never know&#8212;I could have ended up in the Scottish Showmen&#8217;s Guild.</p><p>So, to the celebration. I commend and congratulate Richard Lyle on securing this debate in recognition of the 125th anniversary of the Scottish Showmen&#8217;s Guild. It is a celebration of many things that are good about our society; the guild has enriched Scottish society by contributing, evolving and changing and delivering fantastic events across the nation from village galas to festivals, enriching our culture and our history. It has a place for the future as well and it displays the economic, entrepreneurial, and business acumen that the First Minister has referenced.</p><p>I am also mindful that the First Minister, Alex Salmond, had the honour of being an honorary member of the guild, which was news to me but which is very welcome. I am also aware that the Scottish section of the Showmen&#8217;s Guild of Great Britain is the largest section, which shows the strength that it has in Scotland, with nearly 400 members building on the strong tradition of entertainment and contribution to local communities. I encourage the guild to continue its work of protecting the cultural heritage of showpeople, which helps bring communities together.</p><p>Close to my constituency is the Govan old parish church. I do not know how many people know this, but it is the recognised church for all show families in Scotland. That is manifested and evidenced by some of the artwork in the church windows, where we can see the show logo of a hobby-horse, which is celebrated in that church.</p><p>We will look at regulation and support, recognising the place that the guild plays in fairs and shows and what they do for Scotland. The history is well established. I enjoyed hearing about the Kirkcaldy links market as well, which was first established by Edward I in 1305 when he granted the burgh of Kirkcaldy the right to hold an annual fair at the Easter octave. That has grown to become the links market, which we have heard about.</p><p>This is a great celebration. The guild makes a great contribution to our communities, traditions, culture and society&#8212;all reasons to be positive about what it delivers. It contributes to the Government&#8217;s overarching objective of sustainable economic growth.</p><p>There are further opportunities ahead in 2014 and beyond, with the year of homecoming and events right across Scotland, to which showmen and women will of course contribute. They will make the year special as we mark it and show the potential that exists. There is also the celebration of the year of food and drink in 2015. I would encourage the guild to work with us to capitalise on that, too.</p><p>I am delighted to have been able to contribute to the debate and I support the motion, which has been supported in a cross-party way.

Those powers cover building regulations compliance notices under section 25; continuing requirement enforcement notices under section 26; and building warrant enforcement notices under section 27.</p><p>When a local authority takes enforcement action under sections 25 to 30 of the 2003 act, it can recover its reasonable expenses from the owner of the building. The exception to that is where it has served a building warrant enforcement notice under section 27, in situations in which work is being done without a building warrant or is not being done in accordance with the technical aspects of building regulations. In such a case, the local authority would serve a section 27 notice on the &#8220;relevant person&#8221;. Usually, the relevant person is the owner of the building, although that might not always be the case. For example, the relevant person could be a tenant who is doing the work themselves or employing a builder to carry out the work for them. In a situation in which the owner was not responsible for having the work carried out, it would be unreasonable for any liability of the tenant to be attached to the title of the building.</p><p>Amendments 1 and 2 expand new section 46B(1)(zc) of the 2003 act and clarify that the qualifying expenses recoverable by a local authority are only those expenses that relate to a building warrant enforcement notice that has been served on the owner of the building. The effect of the amendments is that the local authority can make a charging order under new section 46A only where the person liable for expenses in relation to enforcement under section 27 is the owner of the building.</p><p>Amendments 3 and 5 are consequential on amendments 1 and 2.

Over many generations, it was the members of the organised labour and trade union movement who decided that they were not going to stand for the kind of conditions that pertained in Britain in the early part of the 20th century. Having fought the second world war, they decided that, through their struggles, endeavours, agitation and action, they would change the country for the better. They wanted to ensure that their children and grandchildren had the opportunities that they never had.</p><p>It is because of those struggles&#8212;because of those people&#8217;s determination&#8212;that I, like many in others in this Parliament, was the first in my family who could go to university. It was because of their contributions and struggles that I and many others could take free healthcare for granted. It was through their struggles that, unlike my granny, who had to live in a room and kitchen with an outside toilet, her children and grandchildren could aspire to decent houses.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson mentioned comprehensive education, and there is a whole list of things that the labour and trade union movement delivered for this country. The movement helped to define Britain in the 20th century and into the 21st century. Because of that, we owe those people something. We should thank them, with not just words but our actions, for everything that they did to give us the best possible start in life.</p><p>Fiona McLeod said that all she has heard from the Opposition today is carping. Far from it. Labour members and the Lib Dems, when we were in coalition with them for a period, delivered a number of things in the Parliament when the money was flowing, such as free personal care and free transport, as others have said. It was right that we did that.</p><p>The challenge is not older people, because, as Nanette Milne and others have said, older people are not a burden but an asset to our society. The challenge is for our generation to find the means and the money to ensure that older people are able to live their retirement with dignity and pride. That will mean that we have to make choices as a society; there is no doubt about that, because everything cannot be delivered to everybody irrespective of the consequences.</p><p>As other members have said, the ageing population&#8212;the population&#8217;s changing demographic profile&#8212;means that more and more older people are relying on fewer and fewer younger people to pay for their retirement. How will we meet that challenge? If our aspiration is to repay the debt that we owe to that older generation, we should look at providing decent pensions&#8212;there is no doubt about that&#8212;and ensuring that the money is there to pay for those pensions. Therefore, it is right to debate how we pay for them and what we can afford. The last thing that we want to do is make irresponsible promises that, as older people are wise enough to know, can never be delivered.</p><p>We heard about housing and care, but it is not enough to say that people in later life who need care deserve it. We have to show that quality care is there for them in their time of need. Something that is apparent not just in Renfrewshire Council, in my constituency, but right across the country is that we are not building enough specialist homes and very sheltered and sheltered housing. We are not building enough houses that are appropriate to the needs of the older generation, if many of them, like Fiona McLeod&#8217;s father-in-law, are living to near enough 100.</p><p>That is a challenge for us. Up until now, we in this Parliament have made a choice: we have decided that money will not be available for all the homes that are necessary. That is the wrong choice, because older people need homes now. In the same way, they need care&#8212;flexible care. Ken Macintosh and others have mentioned what is happening in care, with people going in and out quickly, and the proper levels of care not being sustained.</p><p>The problem is most obvious for those with dementia. Although there are one or two initiatives in this country that deliver fantastic care, we are closing our eyes to the problem that is confronting our society with the growing numbers with dementia. They are not a burden and they are not a challenge; they are simply members of our families who need a particular type of care. Dementia services need to be reshaped, rejigged and retooled.</p><p>To Sandra White and others who talk about the Labour Party threatening to take things away, I say that nothing could be further from the truth.

We could have gone much further and specified a legal requirement that would have forced the Scottish Government to say to its contractors and subcontractors that one of the conditions of their winning contracts would be that they would have to pay the living wage.

In 1947, at the first Edinburgh international festival, my mother-in-law, Elizabeth Watson, was the soprano for the Orpheus choir and sang for the king and queen of the day. My family is very proud of that piece of history.</p><p>We are talking about festivals and culture. I was thinking about why we were having this debate and about why we all enjoy festivals. Are they not about us being able to indulge our passions and at the same time stretch our horizons? We almost have a cultural work-out when we attend festivals. They are about community as well, which we have heard about from other speakers; the cabinet secretary, Patricia Ferguson and Willie Coffey spoke about that.</p><p>A festival is a community of itself. It is a community of those who attend and those who perform, and very much a community of those who produce the festivals, especially when we are talking about small, local festivals. I was delighted that members such as Liam McArthur and Willie Coffey paid tribute to our many local volunteers who work so hard to produce our local festivals.</p><p>Members will not be surprised that I want to use a fair bit of my speech to talk about the festivals that we have in my constituency of Strathkelvin and Bearsden and those who work so hard to produce such fantastic events for our communities. Liam McArthur beat me, because his list of events and festivals for his Orkney Islands constituency covered every month of the year, I think. There are four festivals&#8212;out of a large number&#8212;in my constituency that I thought were important to highlight in this debate.</p><p>A festival that has been running for a few years in Bishopbriggs in my constituency is the festival for Thomas Muir. Many members will know that Thomas Muir has the title of the father of democracy&#8212;not just in Scotland but across the world. He was born and lived in Huntershill house in Bishopbriggs, where we have had a Thomas Muir festival for quite a few years. We now have a Thomas Muir trail. We do not just listen to the history and debate the philosophy; we actually walk the streets and byways that Thomas Muir walked. Next year will be the 250th anniversary of Thomas Muir&#8217;s birth. I hope that we will be able to have an event here in the Parliament to celebrate that most important of births in the democratic calendar.</p><p>A new festival that started just last year in my constituency is the Bearsden festival. It was held over one weekend in September last year and it was incredibly successful. Bearsden has about 9,000 households. For the craft festival over that weekend, 1,500 people turned up. Given the millions that we talked about earlier, that sounds insignificant, but 1,500 people out of Bearsden&#8217;s population represents quite a significant community turnout.</p><p>We have been spurred on to continue this year to have more festivals in Bearsden. It was decided to split the festival into three and we have already had the first. When the baton came through Bearsden, we had the Bearsden sport and Commonwealth food festival. I understand that everybody ate themselves to a standstill, despite the rain pouring down. Remember how the baton went all around Scotland in the sunshine? When it came to us, it poured all day.</p><p>East Dunbartonshire cycle festival in Bishopbriggs has been going for a number of years now. Two years ago, it became not only a festival of freewheeling cycling; we managed to add in fair trade as well, so it is now a fair trade cycle festival. Please look and learn&#8212;we can promote lots of things at the same time.</p><p>I will finish with the Kirkintilloch canal festival, which is to be held on Sunday 24 August. I invite everyone to join the 25,000 people who come through Kirkintilloch in one day. Kirkintilloch&#8212;a small town in the centre of Scotland&#8212;attracts 25,000 people. It is a fantastic day and so far&#8212;for the past few years&#8212;it has been sunny every Sunday.</p><p>Festivals are fun, educational and neighbourly, but they also boost the local economy&#8212;with 1,500 people through Bearsden Cross in one afternoon and 25,000 people through Kirkintilloch in one day.</p><p>As a librarian I have to mention quickly the festivals of reading that we have across Scotland.

My father-in-law was the oldest man in Scotland at the time&#8212;he was 89&#8212;to receive a certificate for learning in computer technology. He ran his local residents association and sheltered housing association until he was in his 90s. He was quite an amazing man.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Older People"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>I was content that my father-in-law was a silver surfer. I am not sure that I would have been happy with him being a silver flyer. Towards the end, we were not sure that he should have been silver driver, but there we are.</p><p>The demographics in Ken Macintosh&#8217;s constituency are very similar to the demographics in mine, so I was interested in the degree to which the structure of my speech was reflected in Ken&#8217;s contribution.</p><p>Although it cannot be denied that a growing elderly population can present challenges for services, I want to use the rest of my speech to talk about all the expertise that is provided by a growing older population.</p><p>For Strathkelvin and Bearsden, those older people represent an enormous number of volunteers. They represent carers, activists in the community and spenders. That is an important point, which Nanette Milne made in her speech. Research by the Scottish Government in 2009&#8212;and research by the RVS in 2011, which was referred to by Nanette Milne and is worth repeating&#8212;shows that older people make a net financial contribution to UK society of &#163;40&#160;billion per annum. We should remember that, whenever we talk about &#8220;demographic challenges&#8221; or the older people &#8220;time bomb&#8221;. They are a group who spend a lot; they spend more than they cost society.</p><p>On carers, 21 per cent of over 65s support their parents&#8212;their parents!&#8212;their partners and their children, and 65 per cent of older people help their elderly neighbours to remain safe in their homes and communities. Those are things that we need to acknowledge and celebrate. As has been mentioned by the cabinet secretary and others, older people are also the carers of the next generations. They brought up their own children, and 51 per cent of families in Scotland say that they have asked the grandparents to be child carers, which represents a saving of &#163;660&#160;million per annum throughout Scotland.</p><p>When I was looking at that statistic, which I think was from Age Scotland, it reminded me of when my son was young, 23 years ago. It was because my mum could look after my son that I was able to continue volunteering at the Marie Curie Cancer Care hospice where I had set up a library. I could not have done that if my mum had not been able to look after my son. There were many times, pushing my pram around Bearsden Cross and Milngavie town centre, when I felt like the only person pushing a pram who did not have grey hair because so many grandparents in my area supported their children to go out to work by looking after their grandchildren.</p><p>Older people are very much involved in volunteering. The figures show that 42 per cent of volunteers are aged over 50, which is a significant number that we should bear in mind when we discuss older people.</p><p>Ken Macintosh spoke about hosting an awards ceremony for volunteers. I was delighted to attend the East Dunbartonshire Voluntary Action &#8220;You&#8217;re our hero!&#8221; awards last Friday. I was invited along to give the award to the young volunteer of the year, which I was delighted to do, but our volunteer of the year was a man called Martin Brickley. He calls himself a retired teacher, but he has certainly not retired from life and from active commitment to his community. I will read out a wee list of what he has been up to in the past year. He is a board member of the local public partnership forum, a member of the change fund transformational group and the secretary of Kirkintilloch and district seniors forum.</p><p>It is important that I quote Martin Brickley&#8217;s own words after he had won the award. He said:</p><p>&#8220;The benefits I derive from volunteering are the enjoyment from actively participating in my local community, meeting new people and exposure to new experiences. Older people should volunteer because it makes a massive difference as to how they feel and to what they provide for the wider population. It also means they require less healthcare and general support by being active and feeling useful.&#8221;</p><p>Those are wise words from Martin.</p><p>Pat Brown volunteers as a telephone befriender, a member of the knitting group and as a volunteer officer for East Dunbartonshire Voluntary Action. Her quotation in the group&#8217;s brochure was lovely. She said:</p><p>&#8220;it&#8217;s not just a one way street, you get your own glow back.&#8221;</p><p>Perhaps the best quotation of all was from Winnie Findlay, who is 94 years old. She is part of the &#8220;Wool You Be Our Volunteer?&#8221; knitting project, and she has been knitting for the Samaritan&#8217;s Purse UK shoe-box appeal for many years. She went into a care home a few months ago, but vowed that she would keep on knitting and volunteering.</p><p>My community has an enormous number of older people who are actively volunteering. I will mention just two more: Nan Middleton, who runs Creative Care and last year won the Queen&#8217;s award for voluntary services, and the people in the Anand Bhavan cultural centre in Kirkintilloch.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Older People"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>I certainly will.</p><p>I want to make it clear that we recognise the many achievements of older people and that we celebrate and support them in all that they do.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s older people deserve better than the carping that we have heard from the Opposition during the debate.

I welcome its representatives to the gallery&#8212;I hope that they are there and not standing in a queue, waiting to get in.</p><p>Last week, I attempted to complete The Herald&#8217;s crossword. It had a clue for a three-letter word. The clue was &#8220;sunburn&#8221; and the answer was &#8220;tan&#8221;. I thought that that was quite helpful, because many of us still think that to have a tan is a good thing, but we recognise that sunburn is a bad thing. That clue put the issue into perspective: sunburn and a tan are the same thing; and sunburn can cause malignant melanoma.</p><p>Every year in Scotland, about 1,200 people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma. The main cause of that is UV light damaging the DNA in their skin cells&#8212;that is, sunburn. We can get sunburn from the sun and from sunbeds. From that, it is clear that this is an almost entirely preventable cancer.</p><p>Sadly, over at least the past four decades, the number of people who are diagnosed with malignant melanoma has been rising. In April 2014, we learned from Information Services Division figures that, in the past 10 years, the number of malignant melanoma diagnoses in Scotland has gone up by 43 per cent for men and 30 per cent for women. Given the rise in the figures and given the understanding that the cancer is almost entirely preventable, what can be done? I suggest that we should look at three areas: education, advice and behaviour change; early diagnosis and treatment; and research.</p><p>Education, advice and behaviour change should involve lifelong education. Nowadays, most parents of very small toddlers get the Australian message of slip, slop, slap. We would not think of letting our toddlers out into the sunlight without cream, a T-shirt and a hat on.</p><p>In our nursery schools, we spend a lot of time talking to three and four-year-olds and taking care of their skin when we take them out. However, the education process must become lifelong. When our primary school and secondary school pupils go outside to do physical education or take part in outdoor education trips, talking to all of them about putting on sunscreen and hats should be standard practice. If we have lifelong education, it will become routine for all of us to take care of our skin when we are out in the sun.</p><p>We know that the lifelong education approach works and we know that it produces behaviour change. We just need to look at the smoking cessation figures. Over the same 40-year period during which the rate of melanoma cancers has gone up, we have been stopping smoking and the percentage of lung cancers has gone down. That has been so much about education and behaviour change.</p><p>As the result of a grant from the Ian Sunter Charitable Trust, MASScot went into 28 schools across greater Glasgow last year and spoke to 8,000 pupils. We need to support such initiatives. I am delighted that MASScot will go into schools in my constituency this year&#8212;in Bishopbriggs, I think. We must support organisations in providing lifelong education.</p><p>For early diagnosis and treatment, we need to look at self-examination, so that we are more aware of our skin. Through the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland, MASScot has produced a self-examination pack that includes a DVD that teaches us how to do self-examination. If we do self-examination, we will present to our general practitioners earlier. I suggest that GPs need to be more aware, but perhaps we could also go to community pharmacies with concerns, if community pharmacists got the relevant training.</p><p>Early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is important because it is one of the best ways of treating and curing the cancer. If malignant melanoma is caught early, the five-year survival rate can be 100 per cent but, if it is caught late, the rate is 8 per cent. We must think about that, get self-examination and get our professionals prepared.</p><p>My last point is that we need to do more research. The research is probably a bit too difficult for me to explain. When my husband did his PhD way back in 1976, he looked at the function of ribosomal protein S6. I will have to read out the next bit carefully. He looked specifically at a protein complex called mTOR which is implicated in rapidly developing cancers such as melanoma. When my husband did the research way back in 1976, the hypothesis was that, if we could turn down mTOR activity, perhaps we could slow down the cancer. Thirty-eight years on from that research, two conferences in Europe this year will look at exactly that hypothesis and see whether we can take it further. That is a wee plug for my husband&#8217;s PhD from all those years ago. If we start small, we can perhaps get somewhere.</p><p>I wanted to have the debate to increase public understanding that a tan is not a good thing. We must take care of our skin. I also wanted the debate to be part of the process to change behaviour and change attitudes. I thank MASScot for the work that it does for many people in many ways by providing education, supporting research and helping people one to one after they have been diagnosed.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Skin Cancer"}, {"date": "2014-04-29", "body": "<p>I thank the members across the parties who signed my motion so that we could hold the debate. I also thank the members who will speak and who have stayed to listen to the opening speeches. I thank the minister for meeting volunteers from Action on Hearing Loss earlier this afternoon. I welcome to the public gallery many volunteers and their supporters&#8212;supporters who are human and canine.</p><p>I welcome Delia Henry, who is the director of Action on Hearing Loss Scotland, and her staff. I thank her and her staff for the effort that they put into producing the briefing for the debate, which was incredibly helpful for a lot of members. I think that I am right in saying that Paul Breckell, Action on Hearing Loss&#8217;s chief executive, is up from London. I welcome him and thank him for joining us. He did not need his passport to come here, and he still will not need it after September.</p><p>I first met volunteers for Action on Hearing Loss and its hear to help service at the Kilsyth Road sheltered housing complex in my constituency. On that day, Action on Hearing Loss was celebrating a birthday. The volunteers were there not only to help the people who live in the complex with their hearing aids but to celebrate, so we had birthday cake. That was a nice introduction to a very good group of volunteers; it was also the first time that I met Irene and Muffin, her hearing dog, who inspired me to do as much as I can to help the charity.</p><p>Along the way, I have hosted two Scottish National Party fringe meetings for the charity and attended its drop-in sessions at Kirkintilloch and Bishopbriggs libraries in my constituency. Indeed, I went to the Bishopbriggs library drop-in just before Christmas; there was no birthday cake this time, but there were sweeties and Santa hats. The group of volunteers really know what they are doing, and they also know how to welcome people along to their drop-in services. It would be remiss of me not to say that, in 2012, our Irene and Muffin were awarded the national health service volunteer of the year award in Scotland for all the work that they do. In the past 10 months, 145 people attended the drop-in sessions in my constituency, but we do not have just those sessions, as work is also done in the Campsie view care home and in two sheltered housing complexes.</p><p>This is such important work for a lot of reasons. Having local drop-in sessions for people who need to have their hearing aid retubed or batteries put in makes it so much easier for them to get along and make sure that everything is working okay. Having volunteers doing the work helps, too, because many of them are also hearing aid users, so they bring the personal touch. They are trained to do their job well, but they also bring the hints and tips that they know and give them to the people who attend the drop-in sessions.</p><p>Increasingly, the volunteers also work with other services. For example, just last week, Esther Rantzen from the Silver Line was in the Parliament, and she talked about the work that that organisation is doing with Action on Hearing Loss.</p><p>The biggest and most important thing is that, if someone&#8217;s hearing aid fits properly and performs to its maximum, they will use it. They will not be like my father-in-law, who kept his hearing aid in a drawer &#8220;to keep it good&#8221;. That does not work.</p><p>The issue is also important because deafness is a disability that is associated with ageing, and all of us in the Parliament know that we are looking at an ageing population, so we will have more and more people with a hearing loss, which can be incredibly socially isolating. We have to work on that. I know from my family&#8217;s personal experience that hearing loss can be masked by other problems. If someone has dementia, it is not always easy to know that they have a hearing loss. Local drop-in sessions with people who are trusted are incredibly important.</p><p>This work is about the voluntary sector working in partnership with the national health service&#8212;something that all of us in the Parliament support. It also helps to meet elements of the Scottish Government&#8217;s see hear strategy, which was launched, I think, just last week. I will give some statistics on the work that the hear to help service has done over the past few years. There have been 13,868 interventions to support hearing aid wearers, and drop-in sessions in 52 community venues. Hear to help volunteers have contributed 16,000 hours, which equates to &#163;122,400-worth of work. There are four projects across Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Tayside, Borders and Ayrshire and Arran.</p><p>Those statistics show that this is a valuable service, that it is used well and that it also saves the national health service money, so I conclude by asking why, for yet another year, some health boards are having to be chased for the funding for this incredibly useful service. My plea to the health boards would be that they know that the service makes sense financially, clinically and socially for hearing aid wearers, so they should please just sort the funding. Beyond that, I would say to the four health boards that are involved and are experiencing the benefits they should not just sort the funding but go out and spread the word to other health boards around the country.</p><p>I again thank members for being here and contributing to the debate and, most important, I thank the volunteers for the amazing work that they do across our communities. I finish with an invitation to the reception that I will hold for Action on Hearing Loss in Parliament on the evening of Tuesday 20 May in committee room 2. Everyone is welcome to come along and hear the volunteers&#8217; personal experiences.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Action on Hearing Loss (Hear to Help Service)"}, {"date": "2014-04-29", "body": "<p>It is 20 May.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Action on Hearing Loss (Hear to Help Service)"}, {"date": "2014-04-03", "body": "<p>Mary Scanlon, James Kelly and Willie Coffey, among others, have talked about digital exclusion and digital literacy, and I want to take the few minutes that I have to highlight what libraries are doing to address that issue. Unless we tackle the problems of the digital divide and ensure that people are digitally literate, our young people will simply not see the point of pursuing the fantastic careers that Clare Adamson and Willie Coffey have described. Of course, in making a speech about the role of libraries, I must refer members to my register of interests: I am a member of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals and the chair of the Scottish Library and Information Council.</p><p>If we are to address digital exclusion, we must secure physical access to the internet and to digital resources. I am proud that, to date, &#163;400 million of Scottish Government money has been invested in the rollout of broadband across Scotland. I know that we are still not reaching the country&#8217;s hardest to reach geographical areas and people, but we are making a good stab at doing so and plan to keep going in that direction. I also draw to the chamber&#8217;s attention the fact that 8.5 million hours per annum of free internet access are available in Scotland&#8217;s public libraries, which means that, until the broadband rollout has been completed, there will be a place where people can easily access these services.</p><p>However, as far as digital exclusion and efforts to involve folk in the digital world are concerned, the biggest issue is how we use, not how we access, this technology. That is all to do with digital literacy, which is what underpins ICT and digital technology skills&#8212;and all of that, in turn, is part of information literacy. These are core life skills. In this debate, members have mentioned many times the need for computing studies teachers in schools, but I make a pitch for the school librarian, who I believe is best placed to introduce the core skill of information literacy to every pupil in the country. After all, once pupils have such literacy, they can move along the line to digital literacy.</p><p>Increasingly, in the 21st century, information literacy and digital literacy are also lifelong skills. That is where public libraries have a great role to play. In Scotland, there are more than 500 public libraries&#8212;or, as I heard them referred to last night at a meeting of the cross-party group on digital participation, &#8220;information hubs&#8221;&#8212;which are freely accessible to everyone. Some 30 million visits are made to libraries every year&#8212;the majority of those visits are made by women&#8212;and 500,000 visits are made to learning centres in libraries. I say to the minister that one of the ways of increasing women&#8217;s participation in the digital skills agenda would be to catch those women when they are in the public library.</p><p>Through the Scottish Library and Information Council, we invest Scottish Government money in the public library improvement fund. The projects have changed phenomenally in the past few years. For example, in North Ayrshire, we have mums and tots working with iPads, to get them used to being part of the digital world. However, in the short time that I have today, I want to bring the attention of the chamber to the coding sessions that are being held in libraries in Dundee and Edinburgh. That is where we are moving young people from being digital consumers to digital creators. They are learning&#8212;especially in Dundee, with the help of volunteer students from Abertay University&#8212;how to do the coding to make the games that they want to play. I should also mention that, last night, I heard that 3D printing is coming to schools in the very far north of Scotland.</p><p>We must overcome the digital divide by providing access and, above all, the skills and motivation to use the technology. I am proud of the comprehensive and inclusive role that libraries are playing, and will continue to play, in this area, and of the fact that they are funded by the Scottish Government to do so.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Developing Skills for Scotland&#8217;s Digital Economy"}, {"date": "2014-04-03", "body": "<p>I agree with Ms Marra&#8217;s comments about digital exclusion in relation to hardware.

It is just a shame that we do not have more time to explore the issue in more depth. I thought that George Adam&#8217;s impassioned explanation of the benefits of fair trade, which go beyond commerce and into supporting communities, was an important message to take from the debate.</p><p>I remember my own journey in fair trade beginning back in the 1980s, when I&#8212;and, I am sure, many others in the chamber&#8212;would not buy oranges from South Africa. That very small political but also commercial act has now, through the Fairtrade standard, become a coherent worldwide movement for social justice, rather than just an attempt at protest.</p><p>George Adam explained how important it is for communities abroad to be involved in fair trade. I will concentrate on some of the initiatives in my constituency of Strathkelvin and Bearsden, where we see the value of working in our community to support communities all round the world.</p><p>I am short of time, but this morning I was, off the top of my head, able to identify nine fair trade initiatives that are happening across Strathkelvin and Bearsden. East Dunbartonshire became a fair trade zone in 2007. Lenzie became a fair trade town in April 2013. Bearsden and Milngavie have a working group that was started in 2012. We are nearly there; we are about to put our application in. Last year, ED&#8217;s Cycle Co-op held a fair trade festival. Lenzie fair trade town is holding a fair trade baking competition this Saturday. Guess who is going there to judge it? I am not a baker&#8212;as my mum would be one of the first to say&#8212;but I am good at eating baking.</p><p>George Adam and Patricia Ferguson told us about the women who came from Nepal, from Get Paper Industry, to talk to the cross-party group last night. For international women&#8217;s day, those women are coming to talk to women in Kirkintilloch to explain to us how important it is that my community support their community in Nepal.</p><p>George Adam has referred to Paisley&#8217;s Just Trading Scotland, which of course is in partnership with the Coach House in Balmore in my constituency. I am not saying that just to boast; more than &#163;1&#160;million has been raised through fair trading, and that money can be put back into the communities.</p><p>One thing that I want to concentrate on is the fact that between 2012 and 2013 nurseries in East Dunbartonshire piloted being fair trade nurseries. That was so successful that the Scottish Fair Trade Forum is going to roll out that programme across Scotland. I think that at least eight other local authorities are looking to be involved.</p><p>That is so important, because one is never&#8212;even at 3 or 4 years of age&#8212;too young to be a responsible citizen. When a child of 3 or 4 is learning about fair trade, they take that home to their parents and their grandparents, so they are taking the message forward.</p><p>Procurement is an important element. I know that George Adam did not have enough time to go into it. We talked about it in the debate on the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Bill last week. In response to John Mason&#8217;s intervention, I point out that one of my constituents, Angela Oakley, has been looking at fairly traded and fairly procured school clothing and protective clothing. It is so interesting that we all accept that the next step forward is to look at fairly traded and ethically traded procurement.</p><p>We have come a long way from the days when I was refusing to buy South African oranges.

In true librarian fashion, I was going to go through section 8 point by point, but there is not enough time. I refer members to paragraph 53 of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee report, which summarises what I was going to talk about. Alison Johnstone also very helpfully covered a number of the points that I was going to make.</p><p>It has become clear to me that if we want to make sure that sustainable procurement helps to promote fair trade, which many members have mentioned, it will come down to guidance and monitoring. I asked the cabinet secretary questions on both those issues at the end of last year, and the answers made me more convinced about that.</p><p>The committee convener talked about how important guidance will be. I thought that James Kelly was rather dismissive of guidance by insisting that everything has to be stated in the bill, as was Neil Findlay, who asked what happens when people ignore guidance.</p><p>What I would say in favour of guidance is that it comes from the bill and so has a statutory underpinning, but it allows us to be more flexible. If we put something on the face of a bill, it is fixed. If we do it through guidance, we can be more flexible and adapt to the needs of different times.</p><p>The committee convener also talked about how important monitoring will be with regard to section 14, which is on the annual procurement reports. She talked about how important those reports would be for monitoring community benefit aspects. Monitoring will be crucial in finding out whether fair trade is part of the sustainable procurement duty. The annual reports will be incredibly important.</p><p>Alison Johnstone talked about putting the words &#8220;fair trade&#8221; on the face of the bill. I know that the Scottish Fair Trade Forum has talked about that. Initially, that was very appealing to me, especially given that I am a member of the cross-party group on fair trade. There are very active fair trade movements in my constituency. Lenzie is a Fairtrade nation&#8212;[Laughter.] Sorry&#8212;it is a Fairtrade town; Scotland is a Fairtrade nation. I do not have ambitions beyond independence for Scotland. I also have constituents who are working very hard on fair trade. Therefore, putting the words &#8220;fair trade&#8221; in the bill appeared to be quite appealing. However, when Alison Johnstone suggested it in her speech, I wondered whether that was too fixed and whether putting the words &#8220;fair trade&#8221; in the bill would tie us to the Fairtrade brand in sustainable procurement.

However, the games were about more than just 11 days of sport, and I am sure that there will be a long-term and lasting legacy from the games. As we have seen from other major sporting events, a legacy does not come about automatically. Manchester&#8217;s hosting of the Commonwealth games in 2002 can be held up as a good example of a successful legacy because it accelerated regeneration in the city. I can testify to that; I worked for the Royal Bank of Scotland and regularly visited our office in Manchester. The city changed dramatically, as Elaine Murray said.</p><p>The legacy for Glasgow 2014 was a major focus throughout the planning stages of the games. In order for Scotland to benefit from the games, the legacy has focused on boosting participation in sport, increasing physical activity, maximising economic benefit, promoting business growth and increasing employability and skills, urban regeneration and sustainable development, and promoting Glasgow and Scotland&#8217;s image internationally.</p><p>Roughly 70 per cent of the games venues were already in place, but they have been joined by world-class sporting facilities such as the Emirates arena, including the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome. I remember visiting the building with members of the Health and Sport Committee, and we also visited the athletes village, which contains homes for the 21st century. Alongside the new venues, some existing venues have been upgraded, including Strathclyde Park in my region, which hosted the triathlon events. Some &#163;1.2&#160;million was spent on the park to upgrade the facilities for the event, and local residents are delighted, because now that the games have finished, the upgrades are benefiting the whole community. I take this opportunity to thank North Lanarkshire Council for working closely with the games organisers and the Scottish Government to ensure that the enhancements to the park were carried out for the benefit for all.</p><p>With Strathclyde Park being a satellite venue, transport to and from the venue was critical. In that regard, the games have seen a lasting improvement to our rail network, which has shown itself to be capable of coping with the large crowds that were seen at the games. In preparation for the games, more than &#163;2&#160;million was spent on upgrading key stations in order to enhance the experience of visitors to the games. It is clear that railway transport is a significant asset to Scotland that can contribute to the economic legacy of the Commonwealth games.</p><p>As has already been said, Scotland had its most successful games ever, with 53 medals. However, the true success of the games will be the legacy that is felt from them. In order to ensure a viable and long-term legacy, more than 50 legacy 2014 national programmes are in place across Scotland. Those programmes are generating jobs and training opportunities, and are investing in new or upgraded community facilities, which are in turn helping people to become more active.</p><p>Holding a major sporting event brings with it responsibilities in promoting human rights. In this case, I was pleased to note that the Scottish Government is working to strengthen and empower communities across the Commonwealth, including in South Africa, Uganda and Malawi, which has a special place in our hearts and where Scottish Government funding is providing improved infrastructure and sanitation for more than 100,000 people.</p><p>As Bob Doris said, independence for Scotland would mean that more Scottish sportsmen and sportswomen will have the opportunity to compete at the highest levels against the best competition in the world, with a view to an independent Scotland having a Scottish Olympic and Paralympic team in Rio in 2016.</p><p>The values of the Commonwealth games of humanity, equality and destiny are cherished in Scotland and have been right at the heart of our games and I am sure that that will continue in our legacy vision for the future. I pay tribute to the work that was done by the cabinet secretary, by sportscotland, and by all the people who were associated with the games, especially the people of Glasgow, the workers in Glasgow, North and South Lanarkshire, and not forgetting Edinburgh City Council, and all the officials who worked tirelessly to make the games such a resounding success.</p><p>I am sure that Scotland will benefit and has shown the world that we can be independent and that we can run a tremendous games. As my friend Colin Keir said, if we vote yes on 18 September, we will show the world that Scotland is a country to be proud of.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>As a member of the Health and Sport Committee I welcome today&#8217;s statement and I compliment the cabinet secretary on his action.

I am sure that further local improvement will be welcomed by the exceptionally good people of Royston, some of whom are in the gallery today&#8212;I welcome them to their Parliament this afternoon. This Parliament should, indeed, recognise the good work that is being carried out in the Royston area by the local community groups and associations to regenerate their local area. As Cameron Buchanan said, community groups can do something for their area by coming together. I have previous experience of that in my area, but I will not talk about that because you have ruled on that, Presiding Officer.</p><p>The work that is being done needs to be recognised. It can help to inspire other areas and show them what can be done when a community is united in improving its area by creating an environment that is attractive to business. On the point that Patricia Ferguson made earlier, vibrant businesses have to be encouraged to stay or to return to the area. This afternoon, I had a meeting with the Scottish Grocers Federation and it was pointed out that little shops and local businesses are the heart of the community. We do not need all these other shops&#8212;most of the time, they are bookmakers. There has to be a plan that people can get behind, that is attractive and which can help business to grow and can help to continue to reduce the unemployment rate in Royston.</p><p>In a previous life, I was involved in a regeneration area. Basically, all the community groups got together and promoted what they did to the council and the MP. The work that such people do is amazing. They do it for no pay. They do it for their area&#8212;for their people and for their children. We should be getting behind them and helping them to do that. That is why I think that today&#8217;s motion is one that we can support. We have to work with local people&#8212;local councillors and local politicians. I take the point that Patricia Ferguson made about the backing that the leader of Glasgow City Council has given. The council should listen to local people and MSPs to get the situation correct.</p><p>The character of the area must be maintained. We must use all the tools at our disposal to make sure that that is done to the benefit of all, while listening to the local community&#8212;that is the main thing&#8212;and adapting the regeneration policy to its needs and requirements.</p><p>What is being done and going to be done in Royston is commendable and should be supported by all politicians, of whatever political party or persuasion. I complement Bob Doris on bringing the debate and on his work&#8212;and the work of Patricia Ferguson, whose area Royston is in, too&#8212;to ensure that all the organisations involved are given the opportunity to do what they can to improve the area.</p><p>I am pleased that this debate has been held, so that individuals who have given up their valuable time&#8212;people sitting up in the gallery&#8212;for the benefit of others can be recognised, and rightly so. I hope that the debate will lend credence to the call for Glasgow City Council to implement the suggestions of the Royston strategy group to deliver a fitting lasting legacy for Royston&#8212;Patricia Ferguson said that the council leader has given a commitment to do that. I wish all involved success in their venture.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Royston (Regeneration)"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>First, I thank all the members who have supported the debate. I also thank all the members of the Showmen&#8217;s Guild who are in the gallery. In particular, I thank Mr Alex James Colquhoun, who is chairman of the Scottish Showmen&#8217;s Guild, Mr David Wallis, who is president of the Showmen&#8217;s Guild of Great Britain, Philip Paris, who is junior vice-president, and Councillor John Culine MBE, who is senior vice-president, who have all worked tirelessly for years to advance the position of the Showmen&#8217;s Guild in today&#8217;s society. I am pleased to say that the motion received cross-party support within one day, which shows the high regard in which the Showmen&#8217;s Guild is held by members of the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>The Showmen&#8217;s Guild of Great Britain is the trade association for travelling showmen, who gain their livelihoods by attending funfairs. This year marks the guild&#8217;s 125th anniversary. It is by far the oldest and largest organisation that represents the industry and its community.</p><p>On the guild&#8217;s history, it was created largely thanks to the evangelical efforts of George Smith of Coalville, who was a preacher from Leicestershire. He was a self-appointed guardian of public morals who first sought to have his Moveable Dwellings Bill accepted by the House of Commons in 1889. By that point, George Smith had already been successful in persuading members of Parliament to pass legislation that restricted the lives of those who operated and lived in canal boats, and he sought to have similar measures imposed on caravan dwellers. The bill implied that those who lived in moveable dwellings were of an immoral nature, that they lived in unsanitary conditions and that children of van dwellers did not receive any education, all of which was totally untrue.</p><p>As well as being an insult to the community of travelling showmen, the accusations were a serious threat to the way of life of its members. Once the showmen realised that George Smith&#8217;s proposed measures would have severe effects on their lives, the leading travelling showmen of the day met to discuss how they might oppose the bill. Their meeting resulted in collaboration, and they decided to join together as the United Kingdom Van Dwellers&#8217; Association. It was under that banner that they enlisted the support of members of Parliament and other civil society and civil liberty groups.</p><p>Their campaign lasted four years and finally resulted in victory when George Smith&#8217;s bill was rejected by the UK Parliament. The showmen decided that the Van Dwellers&#8217; Association should be kept in place to represent and advocate their interests. Its initial success as an association instilled confidence and led to a series of voluntary regional committees being established in order to maintain contact with members.</p><p>By 1911, the name of the Van Dwellers&#8217; Association had changed to the now recognisable Showmen&#8217;s Guild. The change came as the result of the appointment of the Rev Thomas Horne as the first full-time general secretary. Under the Rev Thomas Horne, the guild transformed to a well-organised and influential national body. By the end of the Rev Thomas Horne&#8217;s life, the Showmen&#8217;s Guild resembled much of its current shape. Regional committees existed on firmer footing and became the 10 sections through which the guild is administered today. Members were also required to observe a strict set of rules with a strong ethical grounding originally called for by the Rev Thomas Horne.</p><p>Throughout the guild&#8217;s 125-year existence, its role has remained unchanged. The Showmen&#8217;s Guild serves the purpose of promoting and protecting the interest of its members, the travelling showmen who provide and uphold the nation&#8217;s funfairs. It is with that purpose that the Showmen&#8217;s Guild has remained strong.</p><p>However, the members of the Showmen&#8217;s Guild are characterised not only by their choice of work; those men and women are contributing citizens to the nation, and many of them were and are veterans. During the first and second world wars, more than 3,000 showmen volunteered to fight on behalf of Great Britain. Of those brave men and women, almost 25 per cent were killed in the line of duty.</p><p>Showpeople at home raised money to pay for a fleet of 19 ambulances and the Showmen&#8217;s Guild started the fun of the fair Spitfire fund, which raised &#163;5,000 to pay for a Spitfire. Today, the guild has a memorial in the National Memorial Arboretum remembering the fallen showmen who died in service to their country. Their dedication to their country extends beyond their ability to provide safe, enjoyable experiences for children and their families. They have a rich history of standing up to protect the civil liberties and freedom of their fellow countrymen, and that deserves our respect.</p><p>The Showmen&#8217;s Guild also deserves our respect for its dedication to ensuring that all funfairs are run with the highest standards of safety. The Showmen&#8217;s Guild places a very high value on the maintenance of all rides, as well as proper safety precautions and protocols. It has played a large role in drafting the code of safe practice at fairs. It is the most comprehensive safety manual for the industry ever produced and, since its introduction, has been expanded by the guild to include specific regulations for individual types of fairground rides. All members owning rides must submit their equipment for thorough examination each year, and annual inspections are conducted by independent engineers to avoid a conflict of interest. The scope of inspections is wide and, without adherence to high standards, the rides are banned.</p><p>With such a rich history and so many contributions to our society, I am very pleased to have the debate, to have members of the Showmen&#8217;s Guild in the public gallery and to celebrate the guild&#8217;s 125th anniversary. The guild and this Parliament have a strong relationship. I hope that, through ministers, that will continue to thrive and grow. I hope that, throughout the debate, we will all come to learn a bit more about the guild, the showmen&#8217;s way of life and the challenges that they face, including the everyday economic challenges.</p><p>I am pleased for the opportunity to speak in the debate and I look forward to members&#8217; speeches.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Showmen&#8217;s Guild (125th Anniversary)"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p></p><p>10.

It was in Orbiston Bellshill; I was eventually elected in 1976, and then won 10 local council elections in a row, mostly under the old system. In 1976, when I was first elected, more than 3,000 people&#8212;two thirds of the electorate&#8212;voted in my local Orbiston ward, but that number has been falling steadily ever since. Indeed, in the most recent local elections in 2012, the poll in the Bellshill ward was only 36.36 per cent. In other words, 36 years on, voting has fallen by nearly half. Turnout in North Lanarkshire was only 37.7 per cent, while turnout across the whole of Scotland was over 39 per cent. There might well have been extenuating circumstances&#8212;it was, for example, the first time that council elections had been decoupled from the Scottish Parliament elections&#8212;but that does not change the fact that something must be done to improve the figures and re-engage the public.</p><p>We must remember that elections are for the people, not for politicians. They are the cornerstone of our democracy. It is clear from both the low turnout for the recent European elections and the projected 80 per cent turnout for the upcoming referendum that the people of Scotland are happy to vote for something that they see as important. We must therefore ensure that the interest, engagement and enthusiasm that the current referendum debate has produced are capitalised on and not lost after 18 September.</p><p>I am not the most technologically savvy person, but it is clear to me that electoral processes have not kept up with recent technological developments. It is my belief that technology must be embraced in elections and that people must be allowed to vote via text, email or the internet by means of an election app or a mobile phone election app&#8212;or even while shopping.</p><p>We already allow postal votes, and postal voting applications in North Lanarkshire have risen from just over 2,000 to more than 10,000 in the past few years. The procedure for applying for a postal vote has changed over the years&#8212;people no longer need a doctor&#8217;s line or signature to confirm that they are too unwell to vote at a polling station. They can now fill in a simple application form, date and sign it, and put down the elections for which they want a postal vote. I therefore see few difficulties in implementing safeguards to allow an electronic type of voting, which will help to encourage many people to vote from their armchairs.</p><p>Many young people vote for their favourite hit tune in the top 100 every Sunday by downloading it online. Why should we not allow them to download their favourite political party at election time? Are political parties scared of losing control of the way in which people vote? Political parties like to control voting intentions by various means such as polls, canvassing, targeted leaflets and doorstep canvassing to get their vote out.</p><p>Wherever possible, young people should be encouraged to engage in the political process. That is already being done to a great extent by allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the independence referendum on 18 September, and I am encouraged to hear that the Scottish Government is seeking views on a general extension of the vote to that age group.</p><p>However, technology alone will not solve the problem. As studies have shown, internet voting simply means that those who would have voted anyway vote by a different method. I find it hard to believe that, in this day and age, it is not possible for a member of the public to turn up at a polling station, legally register and vote all at the same time. That system is being implemented in some areas of America, and the evidence suggests that same-day registration increases voting turnout significantly.</p><p>Ordinary people have many things going on in their lives. They are not politicians, and they are not committed to the political process as we are. We must bring back the old saying, &#8220;Power to the people&#8221;. I welcome&#8212;as members of all parties should&#8212;the Scottish Government&#8217;s consultation document, &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Electoral Future: Delivering Improvement in Participation and Administration&#8221;, and its commitment to improving the quality of democracy. As with all consultations, it is important that everyone supports what is being done.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-05-27", "body": "<p>Follow that, George.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, {"date": "2014-05-27", "body": "<p>I, too, am not a member of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee. I believe that the report sets out a vision of a Scotland in which the most disadvantaged communities will be supported. I am sure that the report is intended to respond to the challenges that are faced by disadvantaged communities, to help to create a Scotland in which all communities are sustainable places in which people want to live, work and invest.</p><p>In order for the vision to be implemented successfully, regeneration must be approached holistically and address the economic, physical and social needs of our communities. Those elements cannot be tackled individually. Each of them is connected and vital to the success of the strategy.</p><p>Further, the delivery of regeneration relies on the achievement of a wide range of support outcomes. Those are in no way unique to this policy and cross over into other Government policies including, but not limited to, economic development, planning, public health and housing. Those outcomes apply to every community in Scotland and not just to those that are disadvantaged. In light of that, there is a need for a co-ordinated approach across the public, private and third sectors, alongside community-led action. In order for those outcomes to be achieved in vulnerable communities, a concerted effort is needed across Government and all mainstream services to deliver the required results. Successful and sustainable communities should therefore be at the heart of the delivery of services at national and local level.</p><p>In my experience, from a previous project in Bellshill town centre, a number of key elements need to be in place in order to deliver successful regeneration so that it puts communities first; involves local residents effectively in the regeneration process; empowers communities; incorporates a holistic process to make connections between the physical, social and economic dimensions of the strategy; and adopts a long-term vision that focuses on the safety and quality of places.</p><p>The strategy applies to all of Scotland&#8217;s communities, but some of our communities will need additional support in order to become economically, physically and socially sustainable. Most often, that extra help will be required in places that are in need of physical renewal and which underperform economically. As a result, the nature and scale of regeneration interventions will be different in different areas and the type of intervention will vary depending on local circumstances. The interventions will vary from large-scale development, focused on economic opportunity, to more localised activity that is intended to address the community&#8217;s needs by tackling ingrained issues.</p><p>We should be aware of where extra support is needed, but it is important that our focus is on the assets that our communities have and not on the deficits of the area. Those assets may be economic, physical and social, and they should be used to deliver sustainable positive change. That is important, because it is generally recognised that applying a label such as &#8220;deprived&#8221; or &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; to a community can have a negative and stigmatising effect. If we focus on the positive aspects of our communities, that will help to overcome the perceived stigma. We should always ask ourselves what makes an area good and what the opportunities are, rather than viewing it as a problem area.</p><p>Focusing on regeneration plays a key role in ensuring that our communities are resilient and that they tackle deprivation and stave off decline. That in turn will reduce the need for regeneration in the future and help to support sustainable economic growth for the whole of Scotland.</p><p>Investment in regeneration will see a knock-on effect on associated budgets such as health, tackling crime and other social issues. A higher proportion of those budgets is usually spent in disadvantaged areas, as the budgets deal with the effects of deprivation across a wide range of negative outcomes. By tackling those negative outcomes, we should see a reduction in spend on mainstream budgets.</p><p>As previously said by Mr Stevenson, lessons should be learned from previous regeneration work. Yes, think small. The town centre regeneration that I was involved in took five years. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. I was convener of the Bellshill local area partnership when the council promoted a major regeneration project in Bellshill. We incorporated new pavements and a town centre to be proud of, with a one-way system and customer parking lay-bys. That was to encourage shoppers back to the town of Bellshill, but it caused problems when people wrongly parked all day in designated areas. With hindsight, I can say that we should have reversed the one-way system and I could make many further comments on that. I will say that there should be full consideration of any work to address any future problems.</p><p>Gordon MacDonald spoke of area regeneration. My best regeneration project was in Bellshill, in the council ward that I represented in the 1990s. It dealt with Bison-type houses in the Jewel scheme: damp, pre-fab houses and flats. We demolished five blocks&#8212;at that time I was called demolition Dick. I ensured that the land was sold for private housing and social rented housing, and was also used for council housing. That whole area, in the Jewel scheme in my former ward of Orbiston, has been totally transformed in terms of flat roofs, back and front doors and reclad flats.</p><p>We can improve areas if we take the time do so. That is why I think that the committee&#8217;s report is excellent. I compliment all the members of the committee for their work on it.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, {"date": "2014-05-14", "body": "<p>I, too, am very pleased to speak in the debate, to highlight the excellent opportunities that are being provided to the young people of Scotland to meet their artistic goals&#8212;whether that is to be on the stage or the screen, behind the scenes or in one of Scotland&#8217;s world-leading creative industries. &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; comprehensively yet practically states strategic aims to enrich young people&#8217;s lives through the arts and creativity by focusing on three key themes: creating and sustaining engagement; nurturing potential and talent; and developing infrastructure and support.</p><p>It is important to instil in our youth a love of and curiosity for culture, regardless of their class, background or where they live, as Willie Coffey said. It has been shown that immersion in cultural activity can help to bolster the resilience and wellbeing of communities and individuals. That is important to Scotland&#8217;s children, and I am proud to support investment in the area.</p><p>In order to carry out the strategy, we will have to invest time and money. However, I am pleased to say that we will not be starting from scratch, as the strategy builds on the strong foundations of a well-established, forward-thinking youth arts sector. Scotland is already remarkable, in that we have a range of national youth arts companies for theatre, dance and music. Clare Adamson mentioned Reeltime Music, which is located in Newarthill in my region and is working hard to include and expand youth provision and encourage youths in the area to come into the basic forms of the arts.</p><p>The curriculum for excellence heavily features the arts and recognises that expressive arts provide opportunities to underpin and enrich learning in all other curriculum areas.</p><p>Despite having the strong bases on which to build, it is important that we do not grow complacent but instead look for new ways to improve provision in every community across Scotland, so that every young person can benefit from culture.</p><p>In my region, the North Lanarkshire creative residency provides opportunities to all secondary 4 and 5 pupils across all 24 of North Lanarkshire Council&#8217;s secondary schools. The programme begins at the start of the calendar year and enables pupils to attend a series of taster sessions that highlight the various disciplines on offer. Following that, pupils can submit applications to participate in a week-long arts residency at Kilbowie outdoor centre in June&#8212;as we all know, Kilbowie is set in one of the most picturesque sites in Scotland. The same pupils are then given the opportunity to participate in a master-class that allows them to hone the skills that they learnt at the outdoor centre. Finally, their work is showcased in an exhibition and event at Summerlee museum of Scottish industrial life in Coatbridge.</p><p>That is just one example of the excellent infrastructure that &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; has to build on, so I am confident that it will be a success and will enrich the lives of the young people of Scotland. &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; aims to be as inclusive as possible. It recognises the different needs of those in the large zero to 25 age group; it also recognises that the term &#8220;the arts&#8221; means different things to different people and can refer to activities well beyond the traditional definitions.</p><p>&#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; is a long-term strategy that is committed to developing opportunities for at least the next generation of young people. The consultation identified three main themes that should be incorporated into the programme so that it can achieve its full potential. Participation is all important, whether as an active participant or as a member of the audience. Both are of equal importance and each individual should determine how they want to engage with the arts. Many factors impact on how young people engage with the arts: where they live; their family environment; their peers; cost; and transport. &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; will work to remove the barriers, so that young people can engage with the arts how they see fit.</p><p>Those involved, or those who wish to get involved, in the arts must be able to progress through their chosen field. For some, that means developing their skills to a recognised standard. For others, progression may mean that the arts help them to recognise personal qualities that let them grow in confidence and assist them in other areas of their lives.</p><p>Scotland is fortunate to have a pool of highly talented and dedicated artists, practitioners and organisations, who work hard to deliver high-quality activities for people who are interested in the arts. I pay tribute to those dedicated people, who seek to achieve the twin goals of engaging as many young people as possible and supporting the development of people who have a particular talent. The &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; strategy encourages such work and proposes ways of sharing information and best practice, to foster collaborative working and sustainability.</p><p>I am sure that this Government recognises the positive impact that art and creativity can have. I pay tribute to the cabinet secretary, who has shown her commitment to widening opportunities for everyone to access and benefit from cultural activity, so that Scotland can be an international leader in youth arts. I thank her for all her hard work on behalf of the people of Scotland. This is her time, and she certainly shines with enthusiasm for the arts and for promoting Scotland&#8217;s culture.

With independence, Scotland will have many new powers&#8212;powers that we have long sought and that I have long fought for in my years as a member of the SNP.</p><p>As my good friend Jim Eadie said, we will not try to be a global superpower, but all countries are interdependent and we can be a good global citizen through partnership with other nations. In &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221;, three overlapping ideas were set out for international relations: first, our partnership with the other nations of these islands; secondly, our regional role as an active member of the EU, with strong links to the Nordic countries and the Arctic; and thirdly, our independent role in international organisations.</p><p>Scotland will continue to be a good global citizen through our commitment to international law and our respect for human rights and good governance. I support the motion and the situation that has been set out by the minister. I compliment the minister on the good work that he is doing to promote Scotland as we go forward as a nation in the world.

I take this opportunity to thank the organisations and individuals who provided evidence during that investigation, which allowed us to draw up our report.</p><p>We made a number of recommendations for the Scottish Government on change and, more important, improvement to the election process. The committee supported advances in voting methods&#8212;the minister outlined some of those today&#8212;while recognising the need for thorough security to be in place in any voting system that is introduced.</p><p>As has been mentioned, a voter turnout figure of 39.8 per cent was recorded in the 2012 local government elections. That was the lowest voter turnout since unitary authorities were created, but the elections were the first decoupled elections since 1995. The committee endorsed the Electoral Commission&#8217;s position that discussions should take place between local authorities, political parties and the Electoral Management Board for Scotland regarding local restrictions on the display of election posters. We heard in evidence that there may be issues about the lack of publicity around election day, particularly in relation to the banning of electoral material on lamp posts and billboards.</p><p>Furthermore, the Electoral Commission has commissioned research on an alternative voting day, which it has been suggested could be on a Saturday. Research conducted by ICM on behalf of the Electoral Commission highlights the many reasons for people not voting, with 24 per cent identifying a lack of time and/or being too busy to vote. Those reasons were found to be top of that poll.</p><p>At the 2012 Scottish local government elections, 16,742 postal votes were rejected. As they accounted for 4 per cent of the total return, the high level of rejection of postal votes is clearly a matter of concern. Furthermore, voters were not notified that their ballot paper had been rejected. That matter needs to be addressed as a priority, especially in respect of ensuring best practice in the verification process.</p><p>Good examples of engagement with the wider public are being applied. In written evidence to the committee&#8217;s inquiry, Dr James Gilmour from the Electoral Reform Society mentioned the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland visiting secondary schools to get pupils to register on the electoral roll. That has already been mentioned in this debate, and perhaps it should be taken forward to ensure that we get young people on the electoral register.</p><p>There are also significant aspects when it comes to voting itself. In particular, the ordering of ballot papers is an issue. There is considerable evidence of alphabetical voting, with about 60 per cent of voters in the 2007 local government elections giving their first preference to a candidate who was higher up the paper, as identified by Curtice and Marsh in their report in 2008. The committee&#8217;s report recommended that some form of ordering should be looked at in time for the 2017 Scottish local government elections. I cite Ron Gould&#8217;s suggestion that ordering for each ward should be determined by a ballot of all candidates. I always find that the publication &#8220;Scottish Council Elections 2012: Results and Statistics&#8221; by Bochel, Denver and Steven, published by the University of Lincoln in 2012, offers useful context and analysis of the turnout.</p><p>When we discuss local government elections, we should be aware of a number of other issues that need to be taken forward. I welcome the work that the Scottish Government is doing in relation to its consultation. We must get the right message to the electorate. We must ensure that all the systems that can be put in place are used to maximise the vote, whether that is in local government elections, Scottish Parliament elections or any other elections in Scotland. We must look to the future and find systems that will actively engage with voters and ensure that they turn out.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-05-27", "body": "<p>I, too, declare an interest as a member of Unite the union, which organises in the Devro plants.

Uniquely for any committee of the Parliament, we started our inquiry with five committee members who were former councillors. The experience of the convener and other committee members as councillors meant that they understood the issues that existed around community engagement. We also wanted to look at the proposition from the bottom up, not from the top down; hence, the report has been written as it has, and some of the conclusions have been influenced by that approach.</p><p>I welcome the mainly consensual nature of the speeches that we have heard in the debate.</p><p>Kevin Stewart talked about what is almost an Aladdin&#8217;s cave of funding schemes that groups have to tap into.</p><p>The minister referred to her visit to the Glenboig Neighbourhood House life centre on 1 April to announce a funding programme, which is where my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests is relevant. I happen to be the chair of one of the organisations that is receiving funding. We very much welcome that funding from the Scottish Government, which will allow us to move forward.</p><p>Cameron Buchanan spoke about how money should be spent wisely and he said that we should monitor closely how it is spent.</p><p>Sarah Boyack referred to the committee&#8217;s view that communities should be involved at every step of the way, which is made quite clear in the report. A number of members referred to communities being engaged, involved and part of the decision-making process.</p><p>Unfortunately, the committee heard that communities often feel that they are the last to be consulted about the developments that go ahead. As a committee member who also had experience of working in urban regeneration a number of years ago, I understood the point. As the committee&#8217;s report highlights, some communities feel that things are being done to them instead of their being involved in doing things for themselves.</p><p>Stuart McMillan talked about urban regeneration companies. There is a further question that we need to consider around the future of URCs and what they deliver for communities. Duncan McNeil also alluded to that and to the work that is required.</p><p>Alex Rowley mentioned the Carnegie UK Trust&#8217;s work in Dunfermline and the work that many voluntary, third sector and charitable organisations do. Other organisations that we could mention include Oxfam, Children 1st and Save the Children. Sarah Boyack referred to SURF. Clearly, a number of organisations are working with communities, but the resources that are available to them are limited. Communities are trying to work with the best that they can get, but it can be difficult for them to tap into the resources, particularly when someone else over and above them makes the final decision about where the funding should go.</p><p>Mark McDonald cited the example of what may happen with the Haudagain roundabout and the impact that that will have on local communities. The private sector investment that is taking place in such areas should benefit the communities and ensure that they see genuine benefits from the developments instead of&#8212;as has happened all too often in the past&#8212;things being done to communities with the private sector moving in and then moving back out, leaving those communities behind.</p><p>Chic Brodie talked about the need to give real local power to our communities. He also referred to change within, and the reinvigoration of, local government. That debate is for another day, but it is an interesting one for us to have.</p><p>Interestingly, the convener of the Health and Sport Committee, Duncan McNeil, recognised that many of the issues that our report raises are reflected in the work of many of the other committees in the Parliament. Our committee will give close consideration to his suggestion that other committees should come together to draw some common conclusions on the work.</p><p>As other members said, regeneration does not affect just communities; it is about economic, social, health and other outcomes that might be achieved if we get the policies right and we engage with people at the right level. If we take people in deprived communities out of deprivation, we will see real benefits across many funding streams. That could have an impact not just on local government funding and Scottish Government funding but on many other funding streams. Genuine benefits could come from communities engaging with all the funders through the community planning process.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson again made some interesting comments. He mentioned the Olympic medal winner Kip Keino to highlight some of the things that might happen if people receive the correct support to engage on issues that they are enthusiastic about and want to engage on. That was an interesting analogy, which many communities should think about.</p><p>George Adam mentioned the great work that is done in Paisley. Interestingly, he referred to the Paisley common good fund. Many communities in Scotland do not know that a common good fund exists and, if they know that it exists, they cannot get their hands on it to do the projects that they want to do.</p><p>Anne McTaggart mentioned the cuts to local government funding. In my intervention on Sarah Boyack, I sought to raise the issue of what was done on regeneration prior to 2008. Where was all the regeneration funding then?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, {"date": "2014-05-27", "body": "<p>I welcome that intervention. Perhaps the Scottish Government and the local authorities should take account of that. The purpose of common good funds is to allow communities in towns to benefit from them. Unfortunately, common good funds are not always used in that way.</p><p>John Mason highlighted issues to do with the Commonwealth games and the work that is being done in the east end of Glasgow, Gordon MacDonald mentioned the work that is being done in Broomhouse, and Richard Lyle talked about his experience in Bellshill and other areas; I will not repeat the comment that he made.</p><p>The report tried to stimulate debate not just in the Parliament; indeed, it tried to stimulate debate mainly outwith the Parliament. We must get everyone to understand that regeneration is not the preserve of officials or bureaucrats, as someone described them. Regeneration is about genuinely working together to ensure that communities benefit from the investment that takes place. We need to ensure that communities understand that they have a vital role to play in the regeneration process.</p><p>The committee will now take forward its report. In doing so, it will take on board the Government&#8217;s recommendations, which it will discuss as part of our further work in examining the community empowerment bill as it goes through the Parliament. From the report and the Government&#8217;s response, I hope that we will get a clear idea of how regeneration can be advanced, so that we can genuinely engage with communities and they can be directly involved in decisions, particularly on funding.</p><p>I thank all those who gave evidence to the committee, whether written or oral, which allowed us to produce our report. In particular, I thank the communities that engaged with us during the course of our inquiry. It was important that the committee heard the voices of communities. From reading the report that we have presented to Parliament, many communities throughout Scotland, particularly those that engaged with us, will realise that we have listened to their voices and have reflected their views, aspirations and hopes for the future. I hope that, as a Parliament, we can work together to engage communities fully in the process and to get regeneration started once again.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, {"date": "2014-05-27", "body": "<p>I thank the members across the political parties who signed my motion and particularly those who are staying on tonight to speak in the debate. I declare an interest in that I have been a member of the Scottish Wildlife Trust for almost 20 years. I will explain later some of the reasons why I joined the SWT.</p><p>This is an important debate in a number of ways, because it emphasises the contribution of the Scottish Wildlife Trust and celebrates its 50th anniversary, especially by acknowledging the important role that the SWT has played in sustaining the vital ecology of Scotland&#8217;s ecosystem. The scale and scope of the SWT speaks for itself, given that the trust manages a network of 120 wildlife reserves across Scotland, with 12 located in the Central Scotland area that I represent. The trust now has in excess of 35,000 members, of whom I am one.</p><p>The trust&#8217;s achievements have been vast in number, and since April 2012 it has raised more than &#163;4.2 million to protect Scotland&#8217;s precious wildlife and wild places. It has also successfully hosted an international conference on national ecological networks and has played a significant role in projects such as the saving Scotland&#8217;s red squirrels project and the Scottish beaver trial.</p><p>The SWT displays a great deal of energy in making a meaningful contribution to supporting and promoting Scotland&#8217;s natural heritage. Equally, it is critical that people realise that, although the trust puts a lot of effort into aspects of conservation, it is not purely involved in conserving the past. Protecting living landscapes is an issue that the trust quite rightly takes satisfaction from, and it is of some interest to me.</p><p>For example, I am aware that the trust has now established planning volunteers in Glasgow and South Lanarkshire, thereby extending coverage to 28 of the 32 local authorities in Scotland, and that it has played a significant role in 20 major planning applications. I also know from my role in the Local Government and Regeneration Committee that the trust has provided useful contributions to the development of national planning framework 3 and that it continues to campaign in the Scottish Parliament on a wide range of issues affecting Scotland&#8217;s ecological environment and wildlife.</p><p>The development and protection of Scotland&#8217;s natural environment is down to the part played by organisations such as the SWT. That highlights the role of charitable organisations in developments at local and national levels.</p><p>In many ways, I come to this debate from the background that I mentioned earlier, as a member of the Scottish Wildlife Trust, and I have witnessed at first hand the work that the organisation does in Central Scotland. I have been a member of the trust for almost 20 years. Part of my reason for joining related to activities for my daughter at the weekends, and I will mention two places that we used to visit quite regularly.</p><p>The Falls of Clyde are not in my regional area, but I have some stories to tell about our experiences there, including the peregrine falcons and the pigeon fanciers who did not like them. We also used to visit the Jupiter urban wildlife centre in Grangemouth, which is on reclaimed land that was formerly an industrial chemical plant. I remember my daughter&#8217;s enjoyment in going pond dipping and being handed a net to fish out whatever she could find in the water, from pond skaters to the various other creepy crawlies and beasties that were reinhabiting the area.</p><p>I also made informative visits to one of the sites in the SWT&#8217;s Cumbernauld living landscape programme not long ago, and I was impressed by the progress that has been made so far. As part of the programme, the SWT will work alongside North Lanarkshire Council on a forthcoming project to celebrate the return of pine martens to the town. That is a unique project. The SWT could not believe its ears when it heard that a pine marten was raiding a local resident&#8217;s chicken coops, but when it did DNA testing it found that it was definitely a pine marten. We can see wildlife reinhabiting areas over which the SWT has stewardship, and other wildlife is coming in as well. Programmes such as that, which look to restore the Scottish landscape and preserve wildlife, are of real value to current and future generations.</p><p>One of the trust&#8217;s real achievements is that it gets out into local communities and makes people aware of their wildlife surroundings and how they can contribute. Members and volunteers throughout Central Scotland have contributed a huge amount to conservation in the area through activities from tree planting to the building of boardwalks to improve access, and I am sure that that is replicated by members and volunteers throughout Scotland.</p><p>By reaching out to schools and local groups, the SWT is particularly sparking an interest in wildlife among young people, and communities are being given tools to explore and cultivate their local areas. I note that, since 2012, the trust has established eight new wildlife watch groups, and a total of 28 groups are now engaging young people throughout the country.</p><p>Scotland has been blessed with some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, and the role that the SWT has played in the past 50 years has been crucial to its protection and development. I look forward to the on-going success of projects including the Cumbernauld living landscape programme and the saving Scotland&#8217;s red squirrel project.</p><p>This debate is important as it highlights that the efforts of the staff&#8212;some of whom are in the public gallery today&#8212;the members and the volunteers who work alongside the Scottish Wildlife Trust do not go unnoticed. Their success over the past 50 years is a testament to the time and energy that all those who are involved put in to make Scotland&#8217;s wildlife and landscape the best that they can be.</p><p>I wish the Scottish Wildlife Trust every success in the future in its campaigns and its work with other agencies to ensure that the hard work that has been done continues to be done.

I therefore have some knowledge of the issues that are presented in Dennis Robertson&#8217;s bill.</p><p>Although legislation already exists for many parts of the blue badge scheme, anyone with even basic knowledge of the subject knows that there are on-going problems with the scheme, particularly in relation to its abuse. Dennis Robertson&#8217;s bill seeks to enhance the rights of blue badge holders. We must recognise that that is what it is about.</p><p>The Local Government and Regeneration Committee&#8217;s stage 1 report, which was published this month, is supportive in principle of the bill and its general intentions. That is not to say that the evidence presented to the committee showed that organisations did not have some concerns about the bill. For example, we heard concerns from the Law Society of Scotland and Inclusion Scotland about its implementation.</p><p>The blue badge scheme is, in essence, about assisting disabled people to live independent lives. During the committee&#8217;s evidence-taking sessions, it was suggested that blue badge abuse tends to occur most frequently in supermarket car parks. We have no legislation on such areas, and people must be aware that private car parks such as supermarket car parks are not covered by the bill. We need to examine that area further.</p><p>The committee also heard evidence about the levels of abuse of blue badges. Gordon Catchlove of the City of Edinburgh Council gave detailed figures, and said that 52 to 70 per cent of the blue badges that are on display in Edinburgh at any one time are being misused. However, we must recognise that even disabled people can hold down jobs and that they depend on the blue badge scheme to get to and from work, so some of the badges that are on display may belong to genuine blue badge holders who are carrying out full-time employment to their benefit.</p><p>That leads me to the area of enforcement. On-street parking is the responsibility of the police or local authorities, as other members have said. I hope that we have resolved that issue, given the evidence that we received at committee.

In the section on &#8220;Gains from Independence&#8221;, the white paper states:</p><p>&#8220;Public services can be kept in public hands. The Scottish Parliament has the power to keep the NHS in public hands but it could not stop other services such as the Royal Mail being privatised by Westminster&#8221;.</p><p>The direction of Westminster is a reduced public service and a reduced civil service.

The white paper gives a commitment to work with the Scottish Trades Union Congress and companies for employee representation on boards. In 13 years of a Labour Government, we had a failure to repeal any of the anti-trade union laws that Margaret Thatcher brought in. Had we had a real Labour Government, that might have been different.

Scotland is simply one of the most exciting places in the world to be this year. As someone who enjoyed the ydance youth festival during the Commonwealth games and George R R Martin at the book festival, I pay tribute to the tremendous work that has been done across Scotland to make 2014 one of the most exciting and successful years in Scotland&#8217;s festivals history.</p><p>I was lucky to be an observer at the second Edinburgh international culture summit that was held in the Parliament at the weekend and earlier this week. It was an incredibly interesting and informative summit attended by delegates from more than 20 countries around the globe. They examined some of the cultural challenges that face us.</p><p>The summit was brought together by the Parliament and the United Kingdom and Scottish Governments with support from the British Council, and it was a fitting swansong for Jonathan Mills, who was part of the culture summit&#8217;s steering group. There were some compelling and interesting presentations that examined the key themes of advocacy and identity in culture, cities and culture, and, controversially, the value and measurement of culture.</p><p>Jordi Savall performed with a collective of international medieval musicians and spoke about how his music had informed his peace work across the world. Ea Sola, a French Vietnamese choreographer, talked about how her work in Vietnam had helped to heal the elderly population and allow them to deal with some of the traumatic experiences that they had had during their lifetimes. Perhaps one of the most compelling presentations was from Nandi Mandela, who talked about cultural identity and a source for positive change in the global environment. As she spoke her grandfather&#8217;s words, it had a profound effect on me and made me think about how important cultural identity is to nation shaping and to our understanding of one another.</p><p>A Polish delegate summed up the measuring and values discussion by saying that not everything that can be measured counts and not everything that counts can be measured. The cabinet secretary summed that up in the Talbot Rice lecture last year when she said:</p><p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t discuss the economic benefits of culture without also acknowledging the contribution that our cultural work makes to help build long-term relationships and trust overseas. As a country, we continue to punch well above our weight internationally, using heritage, culture and creativity to attract other nationals to live, work, study, travel and do business in Scotland&#8212;all of which contributes to growth. Culture helps support engagement with the priority countries and regions identified in the Government&#8217;s International Framework and we have some good stories to tell.&#8221;</p><p>I hope to enlighten members with a good story from this afternoon in this very Parliament. On Tuesday, we had a compelling debate about Gaza, which began with a moving opening speech by Drew Smith. That debate and all the deliberations during the international cultural summit could have been summed up by a few minutes of sublime singing in the Parliament&#8217;s Robert Burns room this afternoon. We had the absolute delight of listening to one of the most emotionally powerful shows at the fringe, courtesy of the Dloko high school choir, who come from the Umlazi township in South Africa. That 30-strong choir of incredibly talented young people who sang and danced for us is all the more remarkable because they hail from a desperately poor township outside Durban in an area where violence and sexual crimes are all-too commonplace.</p><p>The choir is making its international debut at Edinburgh&#8217;s festival, funded by crowd sourcing through an online campaign by the Scottish charity the Iris Initiative. It was fitting that, in the room named after Robert Burns&#8212;the man who penned the words</p><p>&#8220;That Man to Man, the world o&#8217;er,</p><p>Shall brothers be for a&#8217; that&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>the choir included in its repertoire a stunningly beautiful tribute to Nelson Mandela. One young man stepped forward to speak about what their beloved Madiba means to them. In doing so, without blame or accusation and despite their own struggles and experiences of life, they expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine.</p><p>The choir was accompanied by Mr Wallace, a retired teacher from Edinburgh who has been involved in the Jabulani Project for eight years. Jabulani has taken the John Byrne award&#8212;a Scottish award that is aimed at young people in Edinburgh&#8212;out to Durban and has been using it to work with schools there. It is an incredibly important prize, because it involves young people expressing their reactions to other works of culture. Just as in Edinburgh, the aim in South Africa is to stimulate discussion of values and ethics. What a wonderful example of cultural exchange and understanding and of how festivals can contribute to a greater understanding of other cultures and in so doing create a more peaceful and prosperous world.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>On 18 September, the Scottish people will be given a chance to vote and to answer the question: should Scotland be an independent nation?

I especially mention the warm welcome that the committee received on its visit to Orkney this year.</p><p>When speaking to stakeholders in Orkney, I was struck by how much co-operation and partnership working was evident and by how important that was when it came to the unique challenge of the islands, with their ancient historic landscape. There were also capacity issues and sometimes conflicting priorities regarding tourism and conservation.</p><p>The whole idea of partnership working and co-operation is key to the bill and to the strategy, no more so than on pages 10 and 11 of the strategy, which deal with the Government&#8217;s cross-cutting strategic priorities&#8212;its whole priorities for Scotland. The bill is central when it comes to the Scottish Government&#8217;s policy mainstreaming in this area.</p><p>I mention in particular the SNH rangers we met while we were in Orkney. Their praises were sung by everyone we met on the island, including those representing the RSPB, the local authority and Historic Scotland.

I am sure that MSPs from across the Parliament give many answers to that but, for me, it is the 2007 decision to extend the education rights that are enjoyed by Scotland-domiciled students to the children of asylum seekers.</p><p>A Government press release from the time stated:</p><p>&#8220;Children of asylum families are to have the same access to full time further and higher education as Scottish children under plans announced today.&#8221;</p><p>The then education secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said that the changes would give</p><p>&#8220;asylum children who have spent at least three years in Scottish schools the same access as Scottish children to full time further and higher education&#8221;,</p><p>and that the Government would work with councils</p><p>&#8220;to implement HMIE recommendations on providing nursery places for 3 and 4 year-old children of asylum families.&#8221;</p><p>She also said:</p><p>&#8220;This government believes that regardless of where they come from and why any child living in Scotland should receive care, protection and education.</p><p>We recognise our responsibility for all children in Scotland&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;our obligations under the UN Convention on the rights of the child&#8221;.</p><p>I choose that commitment because it was important as it established Scotland as a country of compassion, of fairness and that takes its international obligations to asylum seekers and refugees very seriously indeed.</p><p>In the debate about independence, we often say that Scotland has a unique set of values, one that distinguishes our choices from those made elsewhere in the UK. No area more easily demonstrates that than immigration and asylum.</p><p>From those values, campaigns like the Glasgow girls&#8217; flourished. That campaign against dawn raids was an inspiration to our country. Those young women took their protest to the door of the Home Office to say that dawn raids were not wanted and not expected in Scotland.</p><p>Our values have developed policies such as the Scottish guardianship service, which is highly important for unaccompanied young people, many of whom have been trafficked. It is held up as a model of excellence to the rest of the UK, as the BBC reported in 2013.</p><p>However, independence can make a huge change in the policy area. Evidence given to the European and External Relations Committee on 15 May, when we discussed independence, citizenship and immigration, is informative in the debate. Gary Christie of the Scottish Refugee Council said, talking about the proposals in the white paper:</p><p>&#8220;We welcomed the proposal in the white paper to create a separate asylum agency; it is what we suggested should happen if Scotland voted yes. The rationale behind the proposal was about creating specialism and expertise and trying to move away from the culture of disbelief in respect of which we would criticise quite a lot of Home Office decision making, to a culture of protection.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, European and External Relations Committee, 15 May 2014; c 2036.]</p><p>What a great ambition and what a damning indictment of the current UK settlement that that is how asylum seekers are treated in our country.</p><p>It was welcome that the minister mentioned that asylum seekers could contribute much more to our communities if some of the legislation that prevents them from working and taking a full part in our economy could be removed.</p><p>I was taught in my degree course by a refugee. I have fond memories of Dr Jose Menoz, who was a Chilean refugee. He was a fantastic lecturer and a world expert on data modelling and databases.</p><p>With great interest and pride, I read the reports last year about the Chileans giving thanks to Scotland for the welcome that they received when they came to this country.

All colleges have risen to the challenge of delivering the aspirations of the regionalisation model, which is why we are in a much better position to meet the requirements of young people, women returners and men returners in colleges, and businesses in those areas, than we ever have been since the incorporation of colleges by the Tories&#8212;which Ms Marra seems to support.</p><p>It has been recognised across the chamber that we have an endemic problem, which has to be challenged in all areas: there is a lack of women entrepreneurs and young entrepreneurs. The same barriers exist for women who want to be entrepreneurs as exist for most women in the workplace. We must challenge those barriers if we are going to increase the number of women in all areas of business&#8212;especially entrepreneurs.</p><p>Anyone who visits my parliamentary office will see a prominent display of something that I believe delivers one of the most powerful messages about women: a poster from Close the Gap that shows a scowling young girl sitting beside a smiling young boy. The caption reads:</p><p>&#8220;Prepare your daughter for working life. Give her less pocket money than your son.&#8221;</p><p>That is a very powerful message. Young people who visit my office often challenge me about the poster and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s so unfair.&#8221; It is unfair. There is something about us that means that, as we get into business and grow older, that unfairness sometimes becomes invisible to us.</p><p>It is true that that is still the case for women in Scotland. It is shocking that, more than 40 years since the passing of the Equal Pay Act 1970, women are still paid less on average than their male counterparts. A report from the UK&#8217;s Office for National Statistics in December 2013 makes for alarming reading. According to the ONS, in 2012 the gender pay gap for full-time workers widened from 9.5 to 10 per cent. For part-time employees, many of whom are women, the gap is even wider, and it grew from 19.6 to 19.7 per cent. Those figures should worry us.</p><p>The pay gap is just one example of inequality. There are many others, including women&#8217;s representation in politics and STEM professions. The number of women in senior positions in the workplace and in our boardrooms demonstrates that we are a long way from achieving gender equality. That situation affects women in every sector and area of employment. The current system serves scientists and technologists no better than other women workers.</p><p>I listened carefully to what my co-convener of the cross-party group on video games technology said about that sector, but I have to say that I am somewhat concerned about Jenny&#8217;s summing up of what the sector has been saying to her. This should be much more than a consumer-driven necessity, and if the sector is looking at women only to sell more games, it will be missing out on the same thing that society is losing out on by not having women involved in every area of working life.</p><p>I was therefore very glad that Willie Rennie highlighted the Royal Society of Edinburgh&#8217;s 2012 paper, &#8220;Tapping all our Talents&#8221;. Of course, the RSE is dealing with sectors that are more mature than the games industry, but the industry could learn a lot from that report about women in the workplace who are qualified in STEM subjects. The report says:</p><p>&#8220;Women who ... remain in the STEM workforce are still segregated by occupation ... and grade ... . These forms of segregation significantly impact on both a woman&#8217;s ability to achieve her potential and her earning capacity. The number of women who advance to the most senior positions in STEM remains proportionately much smaller than that of their male counterparts.&#8221;</p><p>Our society has to examine what message we are sending out to women if in all areas of our working life women are not achieving equality.</p><p>As we know, some of the outcomes from such messages can be dangerous. It was only very recently that South Lanarkshire Council agreed to settle its equal pay claim for 3,000 individuals, many of whom were women. The failure to implement the Equal Pay Act 1970 led to women being denied a proper wage for the work that they had been undertaking; the situation had 20 years in the making, and the council now faces a &#163;75 million bill as a result. I ask my colleagues to listen carefully to Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s comment about gender equality being a human right. What message are we sending the young women of North Lanarkshire, where Labour has failed to settle its equal pay claims? We are telling mums and sisters&#8212;and indeed brothers, because men, too, are involved in these claims&#8212;that they are somehow of less worth in their own communities.</p><p>I urge everyone to tackle inequality in all areas of working life.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Improving Entrepreneurship among Women and Young People"}, {"date": "2014-06-05", "body": "<p>As I said in my speech, Audit Scotland said that guidance to colleges was that they should</p><p>&#8220;reduce the number of courses that did not lead to a recognised qualification or that lasted less than ten hours.&#8221;</p><p>Will the cabinet secretary say which courses that do not lead to a recognised qualification or that last less than 10 hours help women into employment?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Improving Entrepreneurship among Women and Young People"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/25073.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "image_width": 99, "person_id": "25073", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Clare Adamson", "member_id": "80485", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Central Scotland"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Siobhan", "last_name": "McMahon", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>I have spoken in nearly all the welfare debates that the Parliament has held since my election in 2011.

Did it work when we needed it to, or did it fail us in our time of need? For too many people across the UK today, the answer will be that the system has failed them.

Instead, we are debating what an independent Scotland&#8217;s welfare system might look like. That would be okay if the Scottish Government actually had a vision of the welfare state that it wants. However, as we know, we are presented with a list of things that the Government does not like about the current welfare state and so-called reforms and things that it would not do, such as work capability assessments and sanctions, but we get little or no information about what would replace such things.</p><p>In our briefings for today&#8217;s debate, the stark figure of 60,000 people in Scotland being sanctioned between October 2012 and December 2013 stands out. It is a horrific number, and not something that can easily be explained away. It represents not only 60,000 individuals, but also their families and dependents. That is an atrocious figure, and the UK Government should be ashamed of it.</p><p>As I have previously stated, I understand that the Scottish Government would not impose sanctions on disabled people who have been found fit for work. I welcome that. However I am unclear as to what would take the policy&#8217;s place. In its own words, the Scottish Government stated that sanctions would be replaced with a system that is</p><p>&#8220;more proportionate, personal and positive.&#8221;</p><p>That is as clear as mud. The Scottish Government has also said that it will abolish work capability assessments. Again, we do not know what would take their place. The Scottish Government&#8217;s own expert group has made it clear that assessment for incapacity benefits is necessary, but the SNP will not formulate any alternative to the work capability assessment before the referendum.</p><p>In contrast, the Labour Party asked a group of people for ideas on how to make things easier for people with disabilities. As a result of that task force, 28 recommendations were made, including recommendations about the work capability assessments.</p><p>Labour has said that we will transform the work capability assessment to make it more effective at helping disabled people into employment. The assessment that is presently carried out does not take into consideration the disabled person&#8217;s ability to work. Therefore, we have pledged to end the tick-box assessment and replace it with one that would include a detailed analysis of the jobs that each person could carry out and which could provide them with a successful career. Further to that, we would ensure that the person undergoing the assessment would receive a copy of the assessor&#8217;s report on how their disability or health condition might affect their ability to work and be told what support is available to them in order that they can work in their local area. Perhaps most important, Labour has committed to making sure that disabled people are given the central role in monitoring how the tests are conducted. They will also be asked for suggestions on how the assessments can be improved.</p><p>As our shadow minister for disabled people, Kate Green MP, said:</p><p>&#8220;We want the assessment to be part of the process of ensuring disabled people who can work get the support they need to do so, not to threaten or punish them. The test should be a gateway to identifying and assembling that support. We also recognise that not everyone can work and we&#8217;re committed to ensuring the support&#8217;s in place for those who can&#8217;t&#8221;.</p><p>The opposite benches might not agree with the vision that we in the Labour Party have put forward, but one thing is clear: we have a vision and we will talk openly about it.</p><p>Of course, the hardship that many people are experiencing is not simply down to work capability assessments. Although it is true that disabled people are nine times more likely to be affected by the austerity agenda, they are not alone. As Oxfam Scotland said in its briefing for today&#8217;s debate,</p><p>&#8220;the evidence clearly shows that changes to the welfare system are a significant driver of rising foodbank use.&#8221;</p><p>Research that was published in June shows that more than 20 million meals were distributed by UK food banks in the past year&#8212;an increase of 54 per cent on the previous year. Those statistics are stomach-churning, but what the people who are using services like these need is a solution to their problems&#8212;problems that have been inflicted on them. They need that now, not in five weeks or five months, but now. This Parliament is letting down every person who has used a food bank by simply talking about the problem and using it as a football for a debate on the constitution. That is something that I will not be part of.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>Finally, the general election next year will mark 70 years since Clement Attlee, the founder of the welfare state, became Prime Minister.

As he knows, however, I have had reservations about the allocation of previous moneys by the Scottish Government, and I know that he appreciates my concerns in that respect. I hope that those concerns will not be an issue this time round and that all applications will be treated on their individual merits.</p><p>The debate has been a good one that has allowed us, once again, to talk about the special relationship that we Scots have with our friends in Malawi. It has allowed some of us who have visited Malawi to talk about our experiences and the memories that have shaped our vision of the country. The debate has also allowed members to talk about the local projects that are running in their areas through church groups, schools or the many spheres of the voluntary sector. By sharing such examples, we begin to understand just how strong our relationship with Malawi is.</p><p>On Sunday, I attended my local parish, St Bernadette&#8217;s in Motherwell, for mass. It was not unusual that the mass was about Malawi given that our parish has designated the first Sunday of every month as Malawi Sunday, meaning that there is always a display in the porch and that prayers are offered for the country. However, it was unusual that a Malawian priest was taking the service&#8212;the mass was said by the parish priest of St Anne&#8217;s in Namulenga, Malawi.</p><p>The parishes have a formal partnership that was established last September, following a visit to St Anne&#8217;s parish that was undertaken by my parish priest, Father Stephen Reilly, as part of a classrooms for Malawi project. My parish has now established a partnership team within our community, and it runs a parish 50/50 club with a monthly draw to provide a stable income for that project. The local primary school of St Bernadette&#8217;s has also established a link with St Anne&#8217;s primary school, and the schools continue to learn from each other. That is another example of the tremendous work that ordinary people are doing on a daily basis to ensure that the relationship that our country has with Malawi continues to go from strength to strength.</p><p>In the previous debate on Malawi, which took place a few short months ago, I spoke about the conditions that many female prisoners experience in the country. I spoke about Amnesty International&#8217;s concerns about the country&#8217;s human rights record, and I asked that the Scottish Government impress upon the Malawian Government that it has a lot more work to do on its human rights and equalities records. As I stated in the previous debate, it is to be welcomed that both the Scottish and UK Governments give large amounts of funding to Malawi. However, with that money should come responsibility, and I can think of no more important an area than this.</p><p>Recently, St Margaret&#8217;s high school in Airdrie was visited by a woman who had been freed from prison as a result of the actions of one of the school&#8217;s pupils. During a visit to Malawi last June, Lauren Strain paid for a lawyer for an unjustly convicted woman, which resulted in the woman&#8217;s release from prison. The Malawian woman had been jailed after her son died from an infected wound that was received during a fight with his brother. Locked up in a run-down prison for her son&#8217;s death, the woman gave birth to a girl on Christmas day. After hearing her story, Lauren paid &#163;40 for a lawyer and within a few days the Malawian mother was released along with her newborn child.</p><p>Lauren Strain carried out that act not for praise but because she could see the injustice of what is currently taking place in prisons across Malawi. That small act by Lauren has made a huge difference to that woman and her family, and we should be able to build on that. The elections in May of this year provide us with this opportunity to start afresh in many areas and to re-establish some of the work that we may not have been getting right previously. I hope that the Scottish Government will seize the opportunity.</p><p>Members have also heard me speak previously about the fantastic work that the Coatbridge charity Aiming Higher in Malawi does. I will not reiterate many of the points that I have made previously in relation to the charity, but I want to let members know of two projects that the charity is currently undertaking in the hope that it will receive the Scottish Government&#8217;s support for its endeavours.</p><p>Aiming Higher in Malawi and St Margaret&#8217;s high school have set up a Catholic women&#8217;s co-operative in Makhoza as a result of a meeting with a young HIV-positive woman, Ruth Samson, who was being sponsored by St Margaret&#8217;s pupils. Ruth was an outcast in her village but, through her relationship with the generous Scottish pupils who visited Malawi several times over the years, her community was saved. Thanks to the fundraising efforts, Ruth now has a new house with a painting by a local Malawian artist on the side of it and, as a result of the co-operative, the villagers have managed to grow enough crops to feed themselves, with a surplus to sell.</p><p>The Scottish Catholic Observer has reported that, at the start of the project, when the Makhoza women were asked what their greatest need was, they asked for a shrine in which to praise God and decided to pray for their friends in Scotland every day for a year. They said that their faith had encouraged them to produce wonders, and they extended their thanks and prayers to all their Scottish friends.</p><p>The second project that Aiming Higher in Malawi has been working on, with the help of North Lanarkshire Council&#8217;s provost, Jim Robertson, is helping disabled children in Malawi. In my previous speech, I spoke about the disadvantages that disabled children face while growing up in Malawi. The wheelchairs for Malawi programme supports children from the poorest rural areas by providing proper medical assessment, by purchasing and fitting wheelchairs, prosthetics, footwear and crutches, and by giving them the tools that will help them to achieve their life goals. In May, Jim Robertson held a gala dinner that raised over &#163;20,000 for the project, but we can do more. I have passed an information DVD about the project to the minister, and I hope that he will look to throw his support behind it.</p><p>The global millennium development goals are due to expire next year, and the United Nations is negotiating the new framework. Although much progress has been made in recent years, the fact remains that one in eight people around the world continues to go hungry each and every day. We must ensure that the new framework tackles that statistic and makes it one that we never have to mention again.</p><p>SCIAF has called for the new framework to involve co-ordinated international action, with each and every state&#8212;not just those in the global south&#8212;playing its part. I hope that the Scottish Government will support such a framework and that it will work with our colleagues in the UK Government finally to eradicate food poverty once and for all.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland and Malawi"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>As convener of the City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill Committee, I am pleased to open this final stage debate.</p><p>I thank all who have assisted the committee in its scrutiny of the bill, including the objectors to the bill and the promoter of the bill. The contributions from both sides on this issue have assisted the committee in reaching decisions on what has been a complex and highly controversial piece of legislation.</p><p>I also thank my colleagues on the committee, James Dornan, Fiona McLeod and Alison McInnes for their diligence and hard work in scrutinising the bill and for their support throughout this entire process. I greatly appreciate it.</p><p>I also thank the Parliament staff who have assisted the committee in our deliberations, in particular Mary Dinsdale, Stephen Fricker, Lynda Towers and David McGill, for their guidance and dedication throughout the process. Not only were they with us every step of the way, I know that they have given up their personal time to assist us in this lengthy process. For that, I and the other members of the committee are truly grateful.</p><p>Finally I would like to thank Richard Welsh, in my own office, who has had the unenviable task of putting up with me throughout the process.</p><p>Today represents the culmination of more than a year of hard work since the bill was introduced on 25 April 2013. In total, the committee undertook around 15 hours of scrutiny and evidence taking at consideration stage alone, which resulted in the publication of our consideration stage report on 22 May.</p><p>By way of background, for anyone who may not be familiar with it, the purpose of the bill is to remove a legal obstacle that prevents the City of Edinburgh Council from changing the use of Portobello park so that it might become the site of the new Portobello high school. In effect, the bill would change the legal status of Portobello park from inalienable to alienable common good land for the purposes of part VI of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, to allow the council to appropriate it to its education function and build the school on the park. The bill does not itself authorise the building of the school, that being subject to the local authority planning process.</p><p>At preliminary stage, the promoter provided details of the alternative legal approaches that had been considered to achieve the promoter&#8217;s objective, none of which was as attractive to the promoter as pursuing a private bill. In that context, the committee, at preliminary stage, was aware of the apparent legal anomaly whereby councils can dispose of local authority land to third parties, with the consent of the courts, but are unable to appropriate common good land for other uses, and considered whether one way of addressing that might be by a change to the general law, which applies throughout Scotland.</p><p>We therefore wrote to the Minister for Local Government and Planning at that stage and were advised on 21 November 2013 that</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government has not reached any decisions on the subject&#8221;.</p><p>The minister acknowledged the &#8220;importance of the issue&#8221; and referred to the consultation on the draft community empowerment bill, which would include</p><p>&#8220;provisions on greater transparency in the management and disposal of the Common Good&#8221;.</p><p>The committee concluded at that time that it appeared that, even if the Scottish Government decided to legislate in this area, no such legislation was imminent.</p><p>I am aware that the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill was subsequently introduced on 11 June and that the provisions of the bill place a statutory duty on local authorities to establish and maintain a publicly available register of all property that is held by them for the common good, and to notify and receive any representations from community bodies or other persons in respect of the list of property that they intend to include on the register. They are also under a duty to publish their proposals and consult community bodies before disposing of or changing the use of common good property. It is clear therefore that the proposals included in the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill would not address the wider specific legal anomaly that is addressed in this bill, so the committee&#8217;s decision at the preliminary stage that the private bill procedure was suitable for this bill remains appropriate.</p><p>With regard to our deliberations at consideration stage, the committee&#8217;s task was to consider all remaining objections, which was phase 1, and to lodge any amendments that it felt were necessary as an outcome of those deliberations, which was phase 2.</p><p>The committee was very aware that its role included acting and complying with the Parliament&#8217;s obligations in terms of human rights. The procedures that were followed by the committee therefore ensured that the parties involved had a fair opportunity to present their respective cases. That was achieved through the extensive evidence that we had before us&#8212;the objections themselves, supplementary written submissions and the oral evidence sessions, which ran from 12 March to 7 May 2014. Once we had considered all the evidence, our task was to assess each objection and consider whether the private interests of those adversely affected by the bill outweighed the wider public interest in what the bill seeks to deliver.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill: Final Stage"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>I am sorry; I do not have time to take interventions.</p><p>The committee had before it 59 objections to the bill. Consideration of those objections was not an easy task. We considered a diverse range of subject matters during the course of this phase: the promoter&#8217;s pre-introduction consultation process; the possibility of the bill setting a precedent for other local authorities to use as a mechanism to bypass the protection of common good land which, it was argued, would occur if the bill proceeded; and issues that are also subject to the planning process.</p><p>In determining the approach to assessing objections, the committee was also keenly conscious, as it had been from the start of the scrutiny process, that its role was not to carry out a planning inquiry. Planning matters had already been addressed during two planning application processes. The committee&#8217;s consideration of objections under the standing orders was in the context of determining the extent to which an adverse effect of the bill, which might also be a planning matter, would impact on an individual&#8217;s private interests and the extent to which that would be balanced by the overall benefit to the community from the bill.</p><p>In relation to the practicalities of our approach to the consideration of objections, the objections were provisionally divided into a number of groups on a geographical basis. For example, objectors who live adjacent to the park were identified as one group and those who live in the surrounding area to the north of the park were identified as another group. We put the main group opposed to the school being built on the park&#8212;Portobello park action group&#8212;and known associated objectors in a group on their own, as we did the golfers, who we considered to be a special interest group.</p><p>We consulted all objectors in each of the six groups regarding the selection of lead objectors who, when that was agreed, were invited to co-ordinate oral evidence on behalf of their respective groups. All 59 objectors were also given the opportunity to provide supplementary written evidence in support of their original objection. In the event, only six objectors took up that invitation.</p><p>All groups of objectors were represented at oral evidence sessions at the committee. The promoter also attended those sessions. That was intended to allow each party the opportunity to present its case on specific issues and cross-examine the other side.</p><p>Before commenting on our views on other issues related to objections, I want to refer briefly to matters that the committee had also considered at preliminary stage. Those included the Parliament legislating after a Court of Session decision; the possibility of the bill setting a precedent; and alternative sites for the school. We set out our views on those issues at the preliminary stage and the committee was not convinced that there was any substantive reason to change those views as a result of the further evidence produced at consideration stage.</p><p>At preliminary stage, the committee had encouraged the promoter to reflect on the lessons learned from each aspect of the process in relation to the consultation. We were reassured to learn that the promoter intended to take into account a number of actions for future consultation exercises, such as ensuring that for any public meetings that involve non-council representatives, all participants should be able to comment on the proposed format of the meeting.</p><p>Although we did not consider that any shortcomings identified in the consultation process were sufficient to sustain any objections regarding the consultation&#8217;s adequacy, the committee noted that the continued reference by objectors to their concerns in this area illustrated a lack of trust between objectors and the promoter.</p><p>We continued to be concerned about adequate protection for the site to ensure that it could not be used for any purpose other than the proposed educational function. At consideration stage, therefore, an amendment was lodged by Alison McInnes whose intention was to ensure that, if the park is appropriated under the terms of the bill and then ceases to be used for educational purposes, it will revert to its legal status and be subject to the title restriction on its use at the time of cessation of use. The amendment has also allowed for circumstances where the appropriation occurs but, for whatever reason, the park is not used for educational purposes. In such a case, if the park were not used for that purpose within a period of 10 years&#8212;if, for example, school premises were not provided&#8212;the legal and title restrictions would once again apply to the park when that period expired. The bill has now been amended to include the terms of that amendment.</p><p>In relation to the replacement of open space promised by the council, which would be formed from part of the existing combined site of Portobello high school and St John&#8217;s primary school, objectors voiced concerns about the site being outwith the local vicinity, being smaller than the space that would be lost and being beside an existing park.</p><p>The council&#8217;s commitment to the provision of open space was also questioned, as was the protection that would be provided by Fields in Trust status, which the council intends to seek for the replacement site. The committee had previously urged the council to consider whether there are any other additional measures that could be taken to allay concerns about the security of the replacement open space&#8217;s future. In response, the promoter provided details of the other possible measures that it had considered and concluded that none of those measures would provide additional protection at this stage. The preferred solution remained the designation of the land as having Fields in Trust status. The council stated at the committee meeting on 7 May:</p><p>&#8220;in the circumstances, Fields in Trust protection is the best proposal for allaying any concerns that objectors might have.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill Committee 7 May 2014; c 361.]</p><p>We are content that that designation should provide a satisfactory additional safeguard for the future of the site.</p><p>The committee took account of each objection on its own merits and circumstances, but a number of clear themes featured consistently. The main issues that arose included the loss of amenity and green space; road safety, traffic and congestion issues; the visual impact of the proposed development, including the loss of views, the height of the building and lighting; and a number of environmental issues, such as noise pollution, operational disturbances and the loss of wildlife and biodiversity.</p><p>In relation to the mitigation measures that might be sought to alleviate concerns in connection with those issues, I highlight that the promoter asked objectors, including in evidence sessions, what proposals they had that might mitigate their concerns in the context of the bill being passed and the school being constructed on the park. Objectors argued that the only mitigation measure would be the school being built on another site.</p><p>In conclusion, the committee has spent over 12 months considering the issues pertaining to this divisive bill and is disappointed that there has not been a greater degree of constructive resolution and engagement between the parties. We acknowledge the objectors&#8217; concerns on various fronts. For example, there will inevitably be adverse impacts due to noise and operational disturbance; there will be a visual impact from the construction of the building and some loss of views to Arthur&#8217;s Seat; and there are indeed health benefits to be derived from open space, which the park provides. However, the committee also recognises that compensatory and mitigation measures will be implemented as required by the planning process; that there are other green and open spaces in the vicinity; and that there will be other benefits to the community from the new sporting facilities.</p><p>Overall, we are satisfied that an appropriate balance has been struck between the private interests of those who would be adversely affected by the proposal and its benefits to the wider community.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill be passed.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill: Final Stage"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>I congratulate Richard Lyle on securing the debate and thank him for making sure that the tremendous achievements of the Scottish Showmen&#8217;s Guild are recognised in Parliament in this fitting way. To my shame, I knew very little, if anything, of the Showmen&#8217;s Guild before I entered Parliament, but I am pleased to say that, in the past three years, I have learned a great deal about this fantastic organisation and the work that it does in our communities throughout Scotland. That is not to say that I was completely ignorant of its work, but I would not have recognised that work as being anything formal and I was not aware of the substantial effect that the work that the showmen do throughout Scotland has on our economy.</p><p>I grew up in Lanarkshire and enjoyed many of the fairs that have been established over the years by members of the guild. I have particular memories of the fair that was held near my grandparents&#8217; home in Newarthill. When the shows arrived, my brother and sister and I knew that the start of summer had arrived, too. We are only one of the many families who have had great experiences and who have such memories. That is all down to the hard work and determination of the showmen to continue to entertain our communities for such a sustained period.</p><p>Members have mentioned the fairs in their communities and their memories of visiting fairs in other parts of Scotland. My colleague Claire Baker, who cannot be with us this afternoon due to other commitments, asked me to pass on her apologies to the chamber and to the Showmen&#8217;s Guild. She also wanted me to convey her thanks to those who made her feel so welcome at the Kirkcaldy links market. Claire has spoken to me many times before about the fair, as it is the one that she takes her daughter to each year. I hope that, one year, she will extend the invite to me, too.</p><p>Members have spoken of some of the challenges for the showmen and the importance of the guild in helping its members to face them. It is simply not good enough that financial barriers are put in place by local authorities and the police. In a recent newspaper article, the chairman of the guild said:</p><p>&#8220;there is more red tape and it is more expensive to run shows in Scotland than any other country in Europe. It&#8217;s become more and more difficult to get a licence every year.&#8221;</p><p>It is time that that was met with a challenge from the Government and I encourage the minister to respond to that.</p><p>I also invite the Government to respond on the matter of registering showmen&#8217;s families at school. Under the current arrangements, there is no place where the families can indicate that their children are from a showman&#8217;s background, so their culture is not only not recorded but not recognised. The closest category into which the children fall is Gypsy Traveller, which is clearly not their ethnic or cultural group. If that happened to any other group of people, we would read about it in newspaper headlines day after day, but this matter does not seem to be getting acknowledged, never mind resolved. I hope that that will change after today&#8217;s debate.</p><p>As I said, I have gained a lot more knowledge about the Scottish Showmen&#8217;s Guild in the past few years. I now know about the Scottish section of the UK guild, the history of its establishment, who hosts the longest street fair in Europe, and how many education liaison officers the Scottish section has. I also know that showmen have their own international football tournament. My knowledge is entirely down to the hard work and determination of the guild&#8217;s chairman, Alex James Colquhoun, and his staff&#8212;in particular, Jane Rodgers. I thank them for taking the time to speak to me and keep me updated on developments, not just in Central Scotland but throughout Scotland.

She sent her best wishes for the debate and to Bobath Scotland. Patricia Ferguson is no stranger to Bobath. She is the constituency member who represents the charity and she has led a number of members&#8217; business debates that recognise the invaluable contribution that Bobath makes to young people throughout Scotland and their families.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate is about recognising the great work of not just Bobath Scotland but the Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments, particularly in relation to education and therapy services for children and young people throughout Scotland.</p><p>Last November, I took part in the HemiHelp professionals conference at the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh. As some members will know, I am one of the patrons of HemiHelp, which is a charity that aims to use specialist knowledge and supportive networks of families and professionals to create awareness and understanding in order to empower children and young people who are affected by hemiplegia across the United Kingdom to reach their full potential. I was asked to speak at the conference about my own experience as someone who grew up with hemiplegia and about what that means to me. As I spoke about my journey, I was not aware that there were representatives of both Bobath Scotland and the Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments in the audience. However, following my speech, they contacted me to tell me that, somewhat worryingly, some of the things that I had spoken about happening 20 years ago are still happening. They requested that I visit each of their centres to find out more, which I was delighted to do.</p><p>The Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments was established in 1991 and is one of Scotland&#8217;s grant-aided special schools. It is based in Cumbernauld, in the Central Scotland region that I have great pleasure in representing. The centre helps mainly children and young people who have cerebral palsy and related conditions. When the centre was opened 23 years ago, the aim was to provide education for children with motor impairments based on the principles of conductive education and other progressive education methods. In doing that, the centre allows children and young people to achieve their potential, which, in turn, allows them to develop their independence and gain key life skills. All the staff who work at the centre have a background in either health or education, which allows for a holistic approach that involves teachers, physiotherapists and other staff working in close partnership. That leads to greater integration of educational and physical activities, resulting in each child&#8217;s needs being met as they require them to be met.</p><p>Bobath Scotland is a Scottish charity that, I am sure, all members are aware of already as a result of the fantastic work that the organisation does not only in Glasgow, where it is based, but throughout Scotland. The Scottish wing of the charity has been devoted to improving quality of life for children and adults with cerebral palsy since 1996. Bobath also provides a holistic approach to therapy, recognising that each person with cerebral palsy is an individual and will, therefore, have different needs and abilities. The therapy that is offered by Bobath Scotland is a transdisciplinary approach involving occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. Bobath Scotland believes that, by taking that approach, it can give people with cerebral palsy the skills that they require to explore the world, communicate their needs and participate as much as possible in all aspects of their lives.</p><p>As I mentioned, the conditions that both the Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments and Bobath Scotland deal with are something that I know a lot about. Having been born with hemiplegia, I know of the difficulties that people face when trying to access vital services such as occupational therapy and physiotherapy. I started attending the out-patient department at Monklands hospital in Airdrie when I was three weeks old. My frequent visits there ended in my early 20s, when I was transferred to hospitals in Glasgow. Monklands hospital was a place that I would come to know very well, and it will always have a special place in my heart. The friendly and dedicated staff that I dealt with throughout my time at the hospital made a massive contribution to the person I am today. Put simply, it is because of them that I have the ability to walk.</p><p>Given that I was in the health system from such a young age, it is somewhat surprising that I was not allocated a physiotherapist until I was around seven. My mum carried out some exercises on me that she had been given by the consultant at that time, but I do not think that it is appropriate to give that responsibility to a parent. The reason for that is simple&#8212;the guilt factor. Despite knowing that if she had not carried out those painful exercises on me I would not be able to do most of the things that I do today, my mum still feels immeasurable guilt at being the person who carried them out on me. Why that burden should be placed on parents when we have trained and capable medical staff available to us I really do not know.</p><p>That is, ultimately, where my frustration lies. It is not good enough that, in the 21st century, we have not achieved a more joined-up approach to healthcare. It angers me that hospital is treated differently from a GP, who is treated differently from an OT, a physio or a social worker. We need a far more joined-up approach that will help not only the patients but all the partners that I have mentioned. Given that there are already centres, such as the two that I have mentioned, doing such work, we should use their expertise as the model and roll it out to every part of our country.</p><p>One of the most important principles of both the Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments and Bobath Scotland is their family-centred approach. Too often, siblings of children with disabilities do not receive the attention and focus that they deserve. I did not realise until a couple of years ago the impact that my disability has had on my younger brother and sister. They were not asked how they felt when they had to spend another endless night at the accident and emergency unit with me or when our holidays were shifted around to fit in with yet another operation for me. Indeed, they were not asked how they felt when other children said insulting things to me in the playground, yet, of course, they were affected.</p><p>That is why the work that is done with siblings at the centres is vital. It helps to maintain a close family bond, not because of the disability but in spite of it. The Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments employs a dedicated family support co-ordinator, which I think is a fantastic idea. To be clear, the support co-ordinator is for the family&#8212;not the parents or the child with the disability but all the family. The co-ordinator assists families in a variety of ways, which include providing information, helping them to secure appropriate services for their children and ensuring that all the family members&#8217; views and feelings are listened to when important decisions are made.</p><p>As members may know, the core services of the Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments are funded by the Scottish Government. However, some vital services, such as those for children under the age of two, the siblings group or the operation and maintenance of the hydrotherapy pool&#8212;at a cost of over &#163;30,000 a year&#8212;are exclusively funded through donations. It costs about &#163;650,000 to keep the Bobath Scotland centre open each year. I understand that 75 per cent of that comes from voluntary sources, although some national health service boards make contributions to the cost of therapy.</p><p>I have had the great pleasure of visiting both centres and I have seen for myself the incredible difference that the individuals at those centres can make in a young person&#8217;s life. I therefore urge the Scottish Government to do all that it can to continue to fund both centres and others like them so that other young people can benefit from those vital services.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments and Bobath Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-05-15", "body": "<p>I am pleased to be able to take part in this afternoon&#8217;s debate on homecoming Scotland 2014. This will be a unique year for many reasons, and it will live long in all our memories for one reason or another. I am very much looking forward to the many celebrations that will take place during the next few months to recognise this unique year, not least of which is my 30th birthday celebrations. However, I understand that they will not be paramount in all members&#8217; minds and that the Commonwealth games and the Ryder cup will be just two of the main events that will receive more attention.</p><p>It is a real shame that the Commonwealth games ticket fiasco has dominated the headlines this week. I have been thoroughly impressed by the way in which the organising committee has engaged with the public throughout the year in the lead-up to the games and I would hate for what has happened in recent days to overshadow that. However, there are still questions to be answered.</p><p>Like many people, I joined the queue for tickets on Monday morning. As members will know, it was one lengthy queue. The website informed me that I would be served on a first-come-first-served basis, but after more than 24 hours in the queue, with very little movement, I was informed by other people that they had received tickets despite only being in the queue for three hours. I and others who were in the same position would like to know why that was the case. Many questions remain unanswered and I hope that the responses will be forthcoming. However, as I have said, the situation should not overshadow the event itself, and I look forward to the games in Glasgow and Motherwell later in the summer.</p><p>As other members have reflected, homecoming Scotland 2014 will host 837 events over the year. I understand that 265 events have already taken place, including the opening of the Kelpies at the Helix park in Falkirk. Whatever view we take of the Kelpies, it is certainly true that they provide a talking point.</p><p>That was only one of the many events that will take place across central Scotland with the help of VisitScotland in the coming months. This weekend, your adventure starts here, a festival of museums, will run at Callendar house and park in Falkirk. On 7 June, Shotts will again host its highland games. That event started in 1950. It attracts more than 2,000 people and it includes events such as tossing the caber. If members have not had the chance to experience it yet, I recommend that they do. It is always enjoyable, no matter what the weather conditions.</p><p>Those are some of the enjoyable social events that homecoming Scotland brings with it, but a year-long event such as this should bring economic benefits to all communities across Scotland. I wonder how we will measure the success or otherwise of this year-long event. Will the measure be the numbers of people who are attracted to each individual event from home and abroad, the number of successful events held, or the long-term job opportunities that individuals are afforded as part of the legacy?</p><p>Many will say that its success will be down to all those things, and more, and I agree with that to a certain extent. However, we will miss a great opportunity if we do not use homecoming Scotland to bring economic benefit to individuals who are trying to secure employment in the current economic climate. As members might be aware, homecoming Scotland 2009 gave us 1,500 full-time equivalent employment opportunities. That was a substantial number, but I hope that we can see an increase on that five years later, and that employment opportunities will be sustainable.</p><p>I am sure that we all agree that tourism has a large role to play in job opportunities. We know that the food and drink industry is seen as a key economic growth area and is vital to the success of homecoming Scotland 2014. However, it might surprise members to know that, according to the Audit Scotland report on modern apprenticeships of March 2014, just over 1,000 apprenticeships were granted in that sector, which is fewer than were granted in the automotive and administration and related sectors, which have not been identified as key sectors. From that report, I also understand that those people who secure a hospitality or tourism apprenticeship are more likely to do so at level 2 than at level 3. The reason that has been given for that is that employers consider that to be more appropriate for the job role. I understand that 60 per cent of apprentices in the hospitality sector are doing a level 2 apprenticeship.</p><p>Given that, historically, the hospitality sector has been dominated by the female population, we need to do more to encourage employers to see the value in awarding higher level apprenticeships. We need to challenge the gender stereotypes that exist in certain sectors of employment, and I believe that we can do that through the apprenticeship programme. Given that, as the Audit Scotland report makes clear,</p><p>&#8220;females accounted for 43 per cent of apprenticeship starts but only a third of apprenticeship spending&#8221;</p><p>of &#163;25.6 million, and given the facts that I have outlined in relation to the hospitality and tourism sector, which according to the Scottish Government is a key growth sector for the Scottish economy, it is imperative that we use homecoming Scotland 2014 as the driving force to challenge that anomaly and to give us a legacy that we can all be proud of.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Homecoming Scotland 2014"}, {"date": "2014-05-15", "body": "<p>I do not know whether I would use the word &#8220;outstanding&#8221;. I appreciate that the situation is better than it was&#8212;I always appreciate improvements&#8212;but the figures for female employment opportunities were not as good as the others and it is clear that more needs to be done in that respect. I am sure that the member will agree.</p><p>As the minister has mentioned, the Barclays report that was published earlier this month shows that Scotland is in line for a tourism boom, with the number of overseas visitors rising faster than in the rest of the UK. We must capitalise on that. The study predicted that spending by overseas visitors will rise by 40 per cent by 2017 and that Scotland could earn a total of &#163;2.3 billion a year from overseas tourism alone. However, I am deeply concerned by the 22.5 per cent fall in domestic tourism last quarter. We need to address that issue, because we should be attracting people from within our own borders, as Ireland managed to do with its successful homecoming.</p><p>To achieve the figures mentioned in the Barclays report, we must begin to remove some of the barriers to tourism in Scotland. I have spoken about the issue before in the chamber, but the problem remains. We cannot begin to take tourism seriously until we have an industry that is open for business when we need and want it to be open. Many of the attractions that people might wish to visit in Scotland, particularly those in Lanarkshire, are not open beyond 5 pm, which means that many people who work during the day will not get to enjoy some of the events that will be showcased this year. I hope that that issue can be challenged and addressed for future events.</p><p>As I said at the start, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this afternoon&#8217;s debate and I look forward to the many events that are still to come to celebrate homecoming Scotland 2014.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Homecoming Scotland 2014"}, {"date": "2014-05-07", "body": "<p></p><p>5.

How will the Scottish Government take a proactive role in promoting human rights and responsible behaviour from Scottish businesses?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: International Development Expenditure"}, {"date": "2014-05-06", "body": "<p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the national youth work strategy 2014 to 2019. Although the strategy has many good examples of youth work in practice and many warm and friendly ambitions for the future&#8212;incidentally, I agree with them all&#8212;there is very little in it that sets out clear objectives for those ambitions. It does not set out a clear strategy for how they will be achieved and there is no mention of how we will measure the implementation of the strategy or, indeed, success against the ambitions.</p><p>For instance, I was surprised that there is not one reference in the 36-page document to the strategy&#8217;s financial implications. I am not the only one to be surprised, as YouthLink Scotland stated in its briefing for the debate that there has been some movement on the funding front and that it is working hard with the Scottish Government to make funding more sustainable. YouthLink Scotland wants core funding, as opposed to short-term project funding, to be made available so that the plan&#8217;s ambitions and those of other services that meet local needs over the long term can be achieved. I ask the minister in her closing speech to comment on what funding will be available or whether it is already up to local authorities and their partners to deliver the funding to enable the strategy&#8217;s ambitions to be achieved.</p><p>The minister will be aware that the first national youth strategy was published in 2007 and the financial package to support it was published at the same time. The money that accompanied that strategy helped to support its ambitions, particularly by supporting those who were in charge of the vision, volunteers and the capital investment projects that were needed for the strategy to be implemented.</p><p>The report &#8220;Youth Work Sector: Distance Travelled&#8221;, which commented on what was done between 2007 and 2011, said that all targets had been met and many of them surpassed. I do not doubt that many of the targets were met due to the hard work and determination of the individuals leading the projects, the volunteers and the communities that wished for the projects to succeed. However, I also do not doubt that the funding that was made available at the start of the process played a major part. Therefore, I repeat my request for the Scottish Government to come up with a financial package and plan to support the ambitions of the current strategy.</p><p>The strategy sets out five ambitions with which I agree entirely. However, it does not give a lot of detail on how the ambitions will be achieved. Will the Scottish Government publish an accompanying document that sets out a more detailed plan for how the five key ambitions will be achieved? I understand that some of them will be implemented through curriculum for excellence and getting it right for every child. However, no further details have been given on how that will happen. Who will be responsible for the implementation of the ambitions through those policy areas? Will it be the Government, local authorities, teachers, social workers or all of them, or will a lead person be appointed?</p><p>Will Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People have a role in the development of the strategy? I presume that that will be the case but I seek clarification, as there is no mention of him in the document.</p><p>I also ask that a more detailed timeframe that measures the strategy&#8217;s ambitions be published. There is already a timeframe in the strategy, but it only sets out what the partners aim to do over the next few years. It does not say how the strategy will be measured or how we will know whether the ambitions will be achieved in the timeframe given.</p><p>I understand that 2018 will be the year of young people in Scotland. Like many members, I would like the ambitions contained in the strategy to be achieved and surpassed by then. We all want our young people to achieve their potential and want to remove all the barriers that might be in their way at present. The strategy that we are debating will go some way towards achieving that vision, but we should go further than that. I hope that the Scottish Government will address the real concerns that I and others have about the strategy so that we can all work together to achieve the ambitions that are set out before us.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: National Youth Work Strategy"}, {"date": "2014-04-23", "body": "<p></p><p>7.

Without those people, we would not have made as much difference.</p><p>Last week, Sarah Boyack and I hosted a Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund event, entitled, &#8220;Taking care of business&#8221;. It was a chance for MSPs and guests to meet SCIAF and its partners from Colombia and hear about the impact of big business on the country&#8217;s Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities. It included presentations from representatives of the indigenous Embera community and Caritas Colombiana. We heard from Monsignor H&#233;ctor Fabio, who co-ordinates a network of offices throughout Colombia that work on peace building, human rights and assisting victims of the Colombian conflict. In December 2003, he led the negotiations that resulted in the release of foreign tourists who were held hostage by ELN guerrillas. In 2012, he received the liberty medal from the Mexican embassy in Colombia in recognition of his work to strengthen democracy and human rights in Colombia.</p><p>At the Parliament event, Monsignor H&#233;ctor Fabio was joined by Father Sterlin and Criseria Chamy, who belongs to the Embera community. Her community has experienced the negative impact of various external actors encroaching on its territory, including illegal armed actors and rich landowners who are keen to expand their cattle ranches. Criseria and her family are featured on SCIAF&#8217;s wee box this year. This is the first time that someone who is featured on the wee box has visited Scotland during Lent.</p><p>Those of us who attended the event could not fail to be moved by the personal testimonies of the three speakers, who told us about the impacts of big business on their community. I make it clear that the businesses that they spoke about were registered in the UK and Scotland and were not specifically registered in Colombia.</p><p>That is why I agree with SCIAF&#8217;s call for a coherent approach to tackling global poverty&#8212;the type of poverty that Criseria Chamy and her community have experienced. To tackle such examples, we cannot rely simply on the aid agreements that we have in place. As SCIAF stated in its briefing for the debate,</p><p>&#8220;a &#8216;policy coherence&#8217; approach must be at the heart of Scotland&#8217;s role as a global citizen; with policy decisions across the whole of Government being made coherently through a development lens&#8221;.</p><p>I could not agree more. The Procurement Reform (Scotland) Bill that is making its way through Parliament gives us an excellent opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to that proposal. I hope that the Scottish Government can support that.</p><p>It will come as no surprise to the minister that I will speak about Malawi. I have spoken about many aspects of my visit there on a number of occasions in the chamber, but I have never addressed the human rights issues that are apparent in the country. I am extremely concerned about those and I believe that Scotland and the Scottish Government could do more on that.</p><p>During my time in Malawi, I visited Chichiri and Zomba prisons. Although the conditions for all prisoners are horrendous, for female prisoners they are inhumane. Despite the efforts of charities and individuals&#8212;none more so than Sister Anna Tommasi&#8212;conditions are only getting worse for women. I witnessed 40 women and children sharing one cell. They had to sleep on the floor with no bedding and had to take a shower three at a time.</p><p>I spoke to a woman who was 74 and had been in prison for more than 20 years without trial. She was not a one-off; that is the norm. As members can imagine, living in such conditions has had a considerable effect on her health, but the females of the prison have no access to the prison hospital, which is reserved for the males.</p><p>An Amnesty International review of Malawi in 2011 showed that prisons there were overcrowded&#8212;the prison system has a capacity of 6,000 but was holding about 13,000 prisoners. Prison congestion was exacerbated by prolonged pre-trial detention. Overcrowding, poor nutrition, poor sanitation and inadequate health facilities contributed to the spread of infections, including tuberculosis and measles. Many prisoners relied on families and charities for supplementary food.</p><p>In June 2010, prisoners in Chichiri prison were locked in overcrowded communal cells with poor ventilation and had to sleep sitting up. Up to 200 prisoners shared one toilet. One inmate had been held for nine years without trial; he was later released on bail. The female section of Chichiri prison was similarly congested. Eight of the 55 female prisoners were mothers with babies. Further to that, a report on monitoring of the prisons in Malawi by the Malawi Human Rights Commission in the period between December 2011 and March 2012 revealed that 79 prisoners had died.</p><p>It is clear that human rights are continuously being breached in Malawi. I know that many organisations, including churches and schools throughout Scotland, continue to carry out important work in the country and I would never wish that to stop. We should not underestimate how invaluable the aid that the Scottish Government has sent to the country is and it must continue, but I wonder whether our agreement with the country could be stronger. We cannot allow the conditions that I have just outlined to persist. We must do more&#8212;not to the detriment of others, but to the benefit of all citizens of Malawi. That is our duty as an international partner and would truly support the laudable aim of Scotland being a good global citizen.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland: A Good Global Citizen"}, {"date": "2014-03-27", "body": "<p>As the Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland briefing states,</p><p>&#8220;All parties in the Parliament share a commitment to making Scotland the best place in the world for children to grow up.&#8221;</p><p>For many children in Scotland, the biggest challenge to that will come from growing up in poverty. The briefing goes on to state:</p><p>&#8220;With over one in five children in Scotland growing up in poverty, there is still a long way to go to achieve the vision of making Scotland the best place in the world to grow up.&#8221;</p><p>Research shows us that families that contain a disabled person are at a higher risk of poverty. That is acknowledged in the child poverty strategy for Scotland, which states that the employment rate for adults with a disability is nearly half that for those who do not have a disability. That has to be addressed, and urgently.</p><p>Members will already know my views about the so-called welfare reforms that are being carried out on the most vulnerable members of our society. Nothing that I say today will depart from those views, as I still believe the practice to be abhorrent, but that does not mean that we cannot do more here in Scotland to mitigate the so-called reforms and indeed to prove that there is a better way. We can do that by removing some of the barriers that disabled people face in trying to gain employment.</p><p>The child poverty strategy states:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government&#8217;s Purpose is to create a more successful country with opportunities for all in Scotland to flourish through sustainable economic growth. To achieve this, we need to break the cycles of poverty, deprivation, unemployment, health inequalities and poor educational attainment which have become deeply embedded in our society, particularly in our disadvantaged communities.&#8221;</p><p>If the Government is to fulfil that, it needs to tackle the inherent disadvantages that are contained in the modern apprenticeship programme. Disabled people take up less than 0.5 per cent of apprenticeship places, yet the Scottish Government has no policy to address this fundamental flaw in the scheme. We have the powers today to change the employment opportunities for disabled people in order to give them and their children the future that they deserve. It would be wrong to hide behind the welfare debate and use it an excuse to do nothing. That is why I call on the Government to put in place an employment strategy now that will fulfil the statement that I read out.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s strategy also states:</p><p>&#8220;The availability of employment opportunities remains at the root of tackling child poverty in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>It is not only disabled people who do not receive the full benefits of the modern apprenticeship scheme.

Combined, they will go a long way towards making our towns and cities much more accessible to people who have a disability.</p><p>The proposed powers in the bill will be a welcome addition to local authorities&#8217; powers in tackling blue badge misuse and its impact on genuine users, as long as they are supported financially to enforce the powers. In particular, local authorities will have the power to cancel a badge that is no longer held by the person to whom it was issued to combat badges being passed on to other people. As the minister said, that seems to be quite a lucrative trade. The savings that someone could make by parking in Glasgow city centre, for example, run into thousands of pounds. Local authorities will welcome that power.</p><p>As I said at the outset, we support the bill.

Mine will not be quite so short.</p><p>The debate has been consensual, and there have been no amendments to consider at stage 3, which reflects the general support from witnesses and from the Local Government and Regeneration Committee. All that is testament to the hard work that Dennis Robertson has carried out with the steering groups that were set up, and to the work that has been done with local authorities, the police and Transport Scotland.</p><p>In my opening speech, I outlined why we support the bill, which will bring much-needed improvement to administration of the blue badge scheme. During the stage 1 debate, the minister pointed out that a particularly determined individual could save about &#163;6,000 a year in parking charges by fraudulently using a blue badge in one of our city centres. In itself, that is a shocking misuse, but it is compounded by the fact that the parking spaces are no longer available to genuine badge holders.</p><p>We have concerns about the financial impact on local authorities. We have been reassured that they can cope with the additional costs of review, but we still have questions about their ability to resource the enforcement aspect meaningfully. Regardless of that question, the bill should, we hope, result in increased revenue to councils, as misuse of blue badges is reduced from the current level.</p><p>I mentioned in my opening speech that there is a great deal of synergy between the bill, other legislation that has been enacted&#8212;Jackie Baillie&#8217;s Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Places (Scotland) Bill&#8212;and a bill that is in the pipeline: Sandra White&#8217;s proposed responsible parking bill. Those three combine well to improve the situation for disabled people and will go a long way towards making our towns and cities much more accessible to people who have a disability.</p><p>Section 1 of the bill sets out how the badge will be improved. That should address the issue with people tampering with an expired badge to extend the expiry date or by changing the photo. Some of the evidence that has been given indicates that the tampering and misuse of badges in that way can be fairly lucrative, with free parking on offer in many areas where it is expensive to park without the badge. Section 1 should reduce the costs of that lost revenue to local authorities and open up spaces for use by genuine badge holders.</p><p>The measures in the bill will be a welcome addition to local authorities&#8217; powers to tackle blue badge misuse and the impact that it has on genuine users, as long as they are supported financially to enforce the measures.</p><p>Although we have always been supportive of the bill, we seek assurances that there will be an education campaign to inform genuine blue badge users of exactly what they can and cannot do with their badges.

I would like to acknowledge, as the Government motion does, the debt of gratitude that Scotland owes to those who have served in the defence of freedom and to put on record the continued support that we, on this side of the chamber, give to our armed forces personnel and the 400,000 veterans in Scotland. I also echo and support the minister&#8217;s comments on the support that there was on the ground for the veterans who returned to celebrate 70 years on from D day.</p><p>We are committed to continuing to work on a cross-party basis to ensure that our veterans and their families receive the support that they need and deserve. In particular, we recognise that our service personnel often need help with the transition to civilian life&#8212;particularly in finding housing and employment&#8212;and we recognise that those who leave the service can bear physical and psychological scars for many years after their service ends.</p><p>Being a member of the armed forces, particularly during times of conflict, is immensely stressful&#8212;stressful beyond anything that we can imagine. However, that stressful situation creates a level of commitment and an intense bond among service personnel that is unique to our armed forces.</p><p>I could only listen and try to take it on board when I heard from a soldier who had served in Afghanistan what it was like to come under fire, and what the impact on their battalion or regiment was when it lost a member of its own, who was as close as any family member.</p><p>I can only imagine how isolated someone must feel if they are discharged from the armed forces into society alone, with no family support, having had such a close bond with the comrades they fought with and possibly lost in combat&#8212;going from living in such close quarters with people they considered family, and eating, sleeping, working and socialising with the same close group, to being discharged into a community of strangers who tend not to understand military life and the bond between people that it creates.</p><p>As the minister said, the majority of servicemen and women make a successful transition to civilian life. The veterans we have in Scotland are not a problem; they are an asset to communities. The minister was quite right to flag up that a lot of veterans have transferable skills that they do not realise they have, which become assets to companies and communities.</p><p>For the reasons that I mentioned earlier, it really is not hard to see why some veterans struggle to adapt and reintegrate, which can put a massive strain on family life as well as on those without family.</p><p>It is vital that the advice and support services are in place for former service personnel to adjust to living in mainstream society. We must support plans to co-ordinate and deliver support and advice services from the public, private and voluntary sectors for ex-service personnel, their partners and their children.</p><p>There are too many fantastic organisations providing support and advice to ex-service personnel and their families to mention and do justice to, but I want to mention some. The first is Supporting Britain&#8217;s Reservists and Employers, which I have spoken about before, which gives people experience of what being an armed forces reservist involves. SaBRE gives advice and information on the extra skills that a reservist can bring to an organisation or company, to try to boost the likelihood of companies employing reservists. It provides weekend training courses for employers so that they can see exactly what skills a reservist picks up in their training and what they can bring back to their organisations. There is an open invitation from SaBRE to any MSP who would like to go on any of those training weekends. I would be happy to pass on the details.</p><p>We must continue to support organisations that do tremendous work in the community for former service personnel across Scotland, including the Royal British Legion. The legion provides practical care, advice and support to armed forces personnel, ex-servicemen and women of all ages and their families. It runs the poppy appeal annually. Recent appeals have emphasised the increasing need to help the men and women who are serving today, as well as ex-service people and their dependents. The legion also assists any serviceman or woman to pursue their entitlement to a war disablement pension. Every year, up to 200 ex-service people in Scotland are represented at war pensions tribunals.</p><p>Just across the road from the Parliament we have Scottish Veterans Residences, which provides residential accommodation to more than 300 ex-service people and their partners and has helped more than 60,000 veterans throughout Scotland since it was established.</p><p>The Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association Forces Help, whose Lanarkshire branch covers my region of Central Scotland, offers financial, practical and much-needed emotional support to current and previous members of the armed forces and their families through services such as forcesline&#8212;a support service independent from the chain of command, which serving members of the armed forces can go to in confidence that they will receive the support and advice that they need. It also runs a forces additional needs disability support group and organises children&#8217;s holidays run by volunteers that offer experiences and activities to which some of the children would not normally have access.</p><p>Erskine is the leading provider of care for veterans in the country. I am happy to be wearing my Erskine tie for today&#8217;s debate. Helpfully, it came through to the office about a week ago. Erskine provides fantastic services within the community.</p><p>There are things that individual members of the Scottish Parliament can do to assist armed forces veterans and their families. We could take up that offer to go on one of SaBRE&#8217;s training weekends. On Friday, with the support of the Royal British Legion, Citizens Advice Scotland, Erskine, North Lanarkshire Council and Lanarkshire armed forces associations, I am holding a veterans surgery in Cumbernauld to mark armed forces day and to bring those groups together to give advice and support to any veterans in the Lanarkshire area.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Armed Forces and Veteran Communities"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>I would certainly be happy to come together with the minister to see whether we can add cross-party support for the extension of that scheme.</p><p>I know that the interviews for the new veterans commissioner were held recently and I hope that whoever is appointed will be able to build on the tremendous work that is already being done by the Government in our veteran community.</p><p>I will close as I opened by acknowledging the debt of gratitude that Scotland owes to those who have served in our armed forces in defence of freedom.

That came over loud and clear in the speeches that we heard from Christina McKelvie and Graeme Dey, who spoke about their families&#8217; military background, as have other members in previous debates. I do not think that that is the exception, as almost everyone in Scotland can point to some military experience or history in their family.</p><p>That is the foundation of the support that we give to our armed forces personnel and veterans. We owe them a debt of gratitude, and we will be able to mark some of the key events from world war one over the next few years. I met Norman Drummond, the chair of the Scottish commemorations panel, who was able to outline the key dates and events to commemorate the ones with a strongly Scottish dimension, and I look forward to attending as many of those events as possible over the next few years.</p><p>Those who serve in our armed forces are asked to make massive personal sacrifices in their human rights and, ultimately, to give up their right to life in the service of the nation. It is only right that, in return, Governments and we as a nation value, respect and support our armed forces. That culminates in the annual commemoration of armistice day, when we stop to remember those who gave their lives in action so that we can enjoy the freedom that we experience today.</p><p>Members will know that I spent some time in the Territorial Army, and I have not had the same experience in any other situation in life. However, although I went through all the training that a reservist can, I did not deploy because of other commitments. I cannot begin to imagine the level of intensity and commitment to their fellow soldiers that those on the front line will have experienced.</p><p>It is hard to listen to people who have served in front-line action when they speak about some of their experiences but, having done so, it is easier to understand the sort of conditions that people often come home with. We can only imagine how isolated someone must feel when they are discharged from the armed forces after being in such stressful situations. It must be difficult for them to find themselves alone, perhaps without family, and they will miss the close bond that they had with the people they fought beside.</p><p>It is of vital importance that the advice and support services are in place for former service personnel, so that they can adjust to living in mainstream society, and that Governments continue to plan, co-ordinate and deliver support and advice services from the private, public and voluntary sectors for ex-service personnel and their families. I hope that the appointment of the veterans commissioner will achieve that and will pull together the work of Government and those voluntary organisations and charities across Scotland.</p><p>I welcome the appointment of veterans champions by local authorities. That approach is starting to deliver positive changes, as in North Lanarkshire, which has amended its housing policy to recognise the priority needs of homeless ex-service personnel and their families when they have just been discharged. I take the point that Alex Fergusson made that there is no point in having a champion if no one is able to access them, if the role is not publicised and if veterans or members of the armed forces community do not know who it is or find it difficult to make contact with them.</p><p>We should continue to support the work that is done by many charities and organisations across Scotland. We have heard many examples of that work today.</p><p>We are committed to working on a cross-party basis to ensure that our veterans and their families receive the support that they need and deserve. In particular, we recognise that our service personnel often need support with the transition to civilian life, particularly with regard to the need to find housing and employment, and that there must be a recognition of the impact that their tour of duty can sometimes have.</p><p>Another important issue that was raised repeatedly concerns the skills that ex-service personnel can bring to communities. Alex Johnstone pointed out the skills that are in demand by companies, and Linda Fabiani pointed out the contribution that ex-RAF personnel are able to make with regard to international development and aid after their tour of duty. That is not to be forgotten.</p><p>I have spoken about what MSPs can do with regard to supporting the organisations and charities that operate in our areas. I hold a veterans surgery. Kenneth Macintosh flagged up the Parliament football team&#8217;s match against the RAF. I know that the trophy is no longer in the Scottish Parliament. I do not really think that that is because the minister and I were not there. I think that it is because also absent were a couple of members of Kilsyth Amateur Football Club, who would have shored up the leaky defence on the Parliament side.</p><p>This has been another good, consensual debate on the need to support our armed forces and veteran community in Scotland. I will close as I opened, by acknowledging the debt of gratitude that Scotland owes to those who have served in our armed forces in defence of freedom.

Those two parties propose devolution of air passenger duty, resulting in tax competition across the UK, with the benefits going to big airlines and the costs being borne by the public purse and the environment.

I will not predict what the level of voter participation might be but, like most people, I expect turnout to surpass the previous general election&#8217;s figures, even if it does not match the most optimistic estimates.</p><p>The operation that we are expecting on the day and overnight, as well as the operation that we are seeing to get people registered and to manage postal votes in all Scotland&#8217;s 32 local authorities is unprecedented. The size of the operation, the scale of the decision and the nationwide effort to ensure that the people of Scotland have their say reinforces that basic point.</p><p>It is not a majority in this Parliament that will determine the outcome of the referendum; rather, that will be determined by a majority in the country. On 18 September, the future of Scotland is in the hands of Scotland&#8217;s people. We have a choice. Much of the debate has, understandably, been an attempt by politicians to frame that choice for people. The purpose of a political campaign&#8212;this is also part of politicians&#8217; unwritten job description&#8212;is to persuade and convince, to make people see how our beliefs and priorities lead us to approach decisions in different ways and come to different conclusions.</p><p>As others have done, I will set out what the choice is about on 18 September. We could vote as the Scottish Government wishes, but what we would gain from independence must be balanced against the new pressures that we would face, the uncertainties that would remain and what we would lose from leaving the UK. Alternatively, we could democratically decide as a nation to share power with the UK&#8212;a union in which we have representation; a union that is becoming less centralised and more flexible while still retaining its essential strength.</p><p>We have a strong Parliament in Scotland&#8212;it is growing stronger&#8212;and we are part of something bigger. We have a resilient economy with oil and gas, whisky and renewables, and we have an integrated market with the rest of the UK, where we sell more goods and services than we do in the rest of the world. We have sweeping powers over economic development and planning and we are part of one of the world&#8217;s largest economies with a stable currency and the Bank of England behind us.</p><p>What we have is not perfect; neither is what is on offer in the white paper. However, in constitutional terms, we have the best of both worlds and the best of both worlds is best for Scotland.</p><p>Most people who are making their minds up about the referendum next month want to do what is best for their community, their family and the country. The Labour amendment makes clear what we believe is best for Scotland, but that is for the people to decide. I trust the people&#8217;s judgment; whatever the decision&#8212;yes or no&#8212;when Parliament reconvenes next month, we must respect that decision and make it work.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>The Parliament is most united when showing solidarity with parts of the world in poverty or distress.

As the second largest aid donor on the planet, we have a powerful voice in the world, which we use best when making rich countries confront poverty and sustainability.

The Scottish Refugee Council has tried to challenge those assumptions by setting out simple and clearly referenced facts about the realities of asylum. I want to put some of those facts on the record today.</p><p>Eighty per cent of the world&#8217;s refugees live in the developing world, many of them in refugee camps having been forcibly displaced. Africa, Asia and the Middle East host three quarters of the world&#8217;s refugees, Europe hosts 16 per cent and the United Kingdom hosts just over 1 per cent.</p><p>It is true that asylum applications peaked in 2002 but by 2010 they were down to a record low. In 2012 in the UK, less than a third of refugees who applied for asylum were successful. We are no soft touch.</p><p>Asylum seekers are not automatically entitled to council homes. There are asylum seekers in &#8220;dispersed accommodation&#8221; but that is allocated by the Home Office; it is nearly always in hard-to-let properties and the number of asylum seekers in dispersed accommodation is equivalent to just 0.05 per cent of the population of Scotland.</p><p>Home Office rules prevent asylum seekers from working, so they are dependent on state support, which can be as little as &#163;5 per day. According to Refugee Council research, asylum seekers do not come to the UK to claim benefits. In fact, most know nothing about our welfare system and have no expectation of receiving any financial support when they arrive.</p><p>I worked with asylum seekers before coming to the Parliament. I helped them to get into training, once their applications had been granted and they were able to look for work. They were not scroungers or chancers, and they were not here to take advantage of or abuse our hospitality. They were child soldiers who escaped African war lords, and people who were looking for a home because their own home had been taken from them.</p><p>They were grateful for the assistance that they received in Scotland, and they were thankful for the opportunities that they found in a country where they were safe and could make a new life for themselves, and where they could put destitution and persecution behind them. Those are the stories that the public need to hear, and those are the facts that the Official Report must record.</p><p>I draw members&#8217; attention to the position of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender refugees and asylum seekers. The Kaleidoscope Trust&#8217;s recent report reminded us that homosexuality is illegal in 41 of the Commonwealth&#8217;s 53 member states, and documented just how pernicious and malign the inequalities in some of those countries really are.</p><p>Next month, athletes and visitors from around the world&#8212;including from those 41 countries&#8212;will come to Glasgow to celebrate the Commonwealth games. We can send out a powerful message of hope by showing that gay athletes and LGBT people are welcome here in Scotland. We can also make a practical difference by ensuring that our asylum system treats LGBT people with dignity and respect. The review into the intrusive questioning of gay asylum seekers is welcome, but we must ask searching questions about a system in which LGBT people have been deported back to countries in which they face persecution.</p><p>The aspiration that the Scottish Government sets out in its motion&#8212;the desire for a more humane asylum system&#8212;is one that my Labour colleagues and I share.

One article that I read tells the story of a young girl called Emily and her great-grandmother. They both make the same journey to the same place every week, but while Emily goes to the Salzgitter childcare centre, her great-grandmother receives treatment for dementia at a day centre across the hall in the same building. There is an open-door policy between the two.</p><p>Salzgitter was the model for the multigenerational house. It is a model that is now growing and developing all across Germany. Pensioners can volunteer to get involved in the kindergarten by looking after the children, reading books, playing and singing, thereby bridging the gap between the generations. In a world in which families increasingly live further and further apart, children who might not see their own grandparents can learn from other older people, who act as positive role models.</p><p>As the model is spread out in Germany, common public places&#8212;bistros, cafeterias, libraries and lounges&#8212;are emerging where the different generations can socialise and interact. The knowledge and experience of the older generations does not have to be lost to the next generation. Likewise, the knowledge and experience of the young does not have to remain alien to older people. That is the lesson from Germany, and it is one that we would do well to learn here in Scotland.</p><p>Of course, we cannot debate the future of older people in our society without dealing with the choice that we will all have to make on 18 September, to which the clear and comprehensive Labour amendment alludes. When it comes to dealing with health inequalities, life expectancy, the stability of our pensions system and the resourcing of our public services, devolution provides the best way forward.

It is therefore perhaps not surprising that, as the motion confirms, 600 people are employed at Abercrombie house in East Kilbride, almost 60 per cent of whom live within 10 miles of the office. That means that many local businesses not only benefit from but have&#8212;especially in these difficult times&#8212;come to rely on DFID&#8217;s headquarters being in East Kilbride.</p><p>At present, as part of the UK, Scotland can be proud that the international aid budget is a staggering &#163;11.4 billion and that the UK, with a population of 60 million, is the first country to honour the commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its gross national income on overseas development obligations.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Department for International Development"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>I would like to make some progress first.</p><p>In an independent Scotland with a population of just 5 million, that vital work in global development in some of the world&#8217;s poorest countries with some of its most vulnerable people would be adversely affected by a fall of around &#163;1 billion in the DFID aid budget.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Department for International Development"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>I will take the minister&#8217;s word for that, but the UK was certainly the first of the G8 nations to meet the target&#8212;that was confirmed earlier.</p><p>Worse still, if Scotland chose to separate from the rest of the UK, it is inevitable that the DFID headquarters would relocate south of the border, which, in turn, would have a devastating impact on the local economy. The Scottish Government's assertion that an independent Scotland would be able to protect and maintain those 600 jobs is simply not credible. Furthermore, the future of the lesser-known work that DFID supports, such as the international citizen service, would also be affected.</p><p>Earlier this year, I had the privilege of meeting two young people who had volunteered with the ICS when it held a photography exhibition in the Parliament building. The ICS programme helps 18 to 25-year-olds from throughout the UK to volunteer overseas and gives them the opportunity to gain valuable skills and experience, regardless of their income, qualifications or work history.</p><p>The ICS is led by VSO but funded through DFID, which recognises the positive impact that volunteering overseas can have not only on the communities in which the organisers are involved but on those who volunteer.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s white paper is silent on whether such a programme would continue to be funded. There is therefore a legitimate concern that, in the event of Scotland choosing to leave the UK, young Scots would lose out on what is sometimes a life-changing experience and the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to fighting poverty overseas.</p><p>The UK is a force for good in the world, with a disproportionate amount of influence overseas for a nation its size.

That is clearly to be welcomed, especially as the programme involves proceeds of crime being targeted at young people who are most at risk of turning to crime and antisocial behaviour. The sport, cultural, mentoring and early years projects that the scheme funds provide a choice for young people who previously may have felt that they had no choice other than to gravitate to criminal activity.</p><p>In practice, the programme has resulted in projects and facilities being delivered in Scotland&#8217;s 32 local authority areas. In Central Scotland, projects in Lanarkshire include badminton courses for 10 to 19-year-olds that are organised by North Lanarkshire Leisure and run by local coaches. The course starts on 7 August at the Tryst sports centre in Cumbernauld and the project continues for a block of 10 weeks, with sessions in Airdrie, Wishaw, Bellshill and Shotts.</p><p>In addition, a new third-generation synthetic turf football pitch has been established at Dalziel park in Motherwell and, in 2012, the East Kilbride Pirates American football team gained funding thanks to the cashback for communities small grants scheme, which covered transport costs and additional kit, with the aim of getting more kids in the East Kilbride area playing American football. Meanwhile, in Falkirk, young offenders at HM Prison and Young Offenders Institution Polmont are being encouraged to build self-esteem and confidence through a dance programme, which will result in an opportunity to perform at the Go Dance 14 event in Glasgow&#8217;s Theatre Royal. Self-evidently, a variety of worthwhile projects are being funded through the cashback programme.</p><p>Turning to the mechanics of how the money for cashback for communities is collected, both criminal and civil recovery powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 are employed by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, working in conjunction with relevant agencies such as Police Scotland and Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs. Two units in the Crown Office&#8212;the proceeds of crime unit and the civil recovery unit&#8212;carry out the work. The vast majority of the recovered proceeds are used to fund the cashback for communities programme.</p><p>The criteria for the allocation of money that has been seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 were agreed by the serious organised crime task force and are:</p><p>&#8220;(1) additional funding for CashBack for Communities; (2) funding to Police Scotland and the Crown Office for enhanced recovery of Proceeds of Crime Act receipts; and (3) other projects, which may include community projects.&#8221;</p><p>It is worth noting that, according to a paper that the Scottish Police Authority issued in December, serious organised crime</p><p>&#8220;costs the Scottish economy approximately &#163;2 billion per annum&#8221;,</p><p>and the harm that it does to local communities</p><p>&#8220;extends far beyond financial implications.&#8221;</p><p>However, even in the peak year 2012-13, only &#163;10 million was seized under the 2002 act. Although good work is certainly being done, more could be done to disrupt crime and, in the process, collect more money.</p><p>The need to tackle that aspect is the basis of the amendment in my name, which calls for</p><p>&#8220;more analysis ... to identify and follow up on crimes in which the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 could be implemented in order to maximise the amount of money seized&#8221;,</p><p>and disrupt crime, of course.</p><p>It is worth stressing that police services must be sufficiently funded and must not rely on criminal money for their core activities. Nonetheless, there is a case to be made for enabling Police Scotland and the Crown Office to bid for money from the proceeds of crime for specific projects.</p><p>Let me be clear that I am talking about projects to identify crimes that could be actively pursued in the context of the 2002 act, such as targeted organised shoplifting by criminal gangs, which is a much bigger issue than shoplifting by individuals. Such an approach would have two positive effects: it would disrupt organised crime and it would generate even more funds for cashback schemes.</p><p>It is essential that we ensure that collection rates are as good as they can be. It is therefore encouraging that further steps have been taken in Scotland to increase the take under the 2002 act, through the Crown Office&#8217;s commitment to pursue court expenses. That will be done through the civil recovery unit, which has pledged to pursue sequestration if necessary, when a challenge to recovery has been made and has failed. Quite simply, if an individual is sequestrated it is much harder for them to get a house or use the proceeds of crime for their benefit. In addition, tens of thousands of pounds will be recovered from court expenses.</p><p>It is to be hoped that the suggestions that I have made in my speech and in the amendment in my name will improve and increase the funding for the cashback for communities scheme, by ensuring that proceeds of crime legislation is applied as effectively as possible in recovering funding from people who benefit from organised crime. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s confirmation that he will consider the points that I have made, although I am a little disappointed that he is not able to support the amendment in my name.</p><p>I have much pleasure in moving amendment S4M-10278.2, to leave out from &#8220;, and believes&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;; believes that much more analysis could be done to identify and follow up on crimes in which the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 could be implemented in order to maximise the amount of money seized; considers that Police Scotland and the Crown Office must always receive the core funding necessary for them to discharge their responsibilities, but believes that there may be merit in looking at the option of enabling Police Scotland and the Crown Office to make specific bids for money obtained from the proceeds of crime for identified projects while ensuring that funds obtained from the proceeds of crime continue to be focused on projects in communities across Scotland as well as those particularly affected by crime and antisocial behaviour and, in so doing, continue to tackle breaking the cycle of youth offending in communities.&#8221;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Cashback for Communities"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p></p><p>4.

Crucially, it is intended to improve access to justice and the court system&#8217;s efficiency and effectiveness. As such, the Scottish Conservatives will support the bill&#8217;s general principles, but the criterion of improving access to justice is the key measure by which the bill&#8217;s provisions must be assessed.</p><p>To start with the positives, the creation of the new judicial appointment of summary sheriff is good news, as are the proposals to increase sheriff specialisation and to create the new simple procedure.</p><p>In relation to judicial review, the three-month time limit and the introduction of a permission stage with the section 85 test of a real prospect of success were the subject of conflicting evidence. Those provisions could reduce access to justice, so the Government and the committee need to revisit the issue, to ensure that the bill adequately balances the importance of judicial review as a remedy for individuals and community groups with the need to ensure that it is not misused.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s sheriff appeal court provisions radically depart from the Gill review&#8217;s recommendation by proposing that the majority of cases before that court should be heard by a single sheriff, instead of a sheriff principal or, when appropriate, a bench of three sheriffs principal. As a consequence, appeals would merely substitute one sheriff&#8217;s opinion for that of another. Worse still, the appeal sheriff&#8212;who might or might not be a senior sheriff&#8212;would in effect be writing the law for the whole of Scotland.</p><p>The financial memorandum clearly states that, if a significant number of appeal cases required a bench of three, that would have an impact on the costs associated with appeals. It would be a grave mistake for the Scottish Government to depart from the Gill recommendations merely to save money.</p><p>The proposal to raise the threshold below which most actions must be raised in the sheriff court from &#163;5,000 to a staggering &#163;150,000 is the most contentious. The Government has now indicated that it is open to considering a lower threshold and it is worth assessing why that change of view is welcome and necessary.</p><p>The current threshold needs to be revised to ensure that low-value cases are not routinely heard in the Court of Session, but the bill&#8217;s &#163;150,000 threshold would result in the transfer of thousands of cases to the sheriff court at a time when 10 courts are closing. That is unsustainable, especially given the evidence that some of our courts are already suffering unacceptable delays.</p><p>Only last week, it was reported that cases in Hamilton justice of the peace court, which has absorbed business from the closed Motherwell court, are suffering a nine-month delay and that fiscals are so pressured and underresourced that they do not have time to speak to defence agents at intermediate diets. Consequently, numerous cases are unnecessarily proceeding to trial. In addition, East Lothian faculty of procurators has highlighted delays at Edinburgh JP court, where trials are being set down for as late as March 2015. Access to justice is self-evidently not being served. In those circumstances, approving the transfer of thousands of cases more to the sheriff court would be an act of absolute folly.</p><p>The threshold would also compromise access to justice, particularly for victims of complex but less costly personal injury cases, as the bill makes no provision for individuals to employ counsel regardless of the fact that their opponents can and will employ counsel. As a result of that inequality, the number of cases that settle will decrease if business is transferred to the sheriff court, and costs are likely to increase as more civil business proceeds to trial.</p><p>Astoundingly, the evidence relied upon to propose the &#163;150,000 limit was weak, being anecdotal rather than empirical. The Scottish Government has not produced any further evidence to support the contention that such a massive increase is in the interests of justice.</p><p>Therefore, it is not surprising that the Justice Committee and Finance Committee questioned the robustness of the financial memorandum, especially as it asserts that the bill can be implemented with no new resources. That is simply not credible, which is why the Scottish Conservatives will vote against the financial memorandum.</p><p>In light of those concerns, a further evidence-taking session on the effect of court closures, the bill&#8217;s proposals and resources should be held with those at the coalface, namely the Crown and Scottish Court Service staff.</p><p>Although Eric McQueen, chief executive of the Scottish Court Service, assured the committee that everything would be fine because sheriff courts were running 2,500 fewer sitting days a year compared to four years ago, he failed to mention that the court closures that are currently going through will result in the loss of nearly 2,000 sitting days. The Government has now accepted that further court closures need the approval of the Parliament, rather than only committee scrutiny so, surely, if our justice system is to be able to cope with the changes that the bill introduces, the Parliament must now be given the chance to vote on the court closures that were forced through last year.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Courts Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-05-20", "body": "<p>Will the cabinet secretary confirm whether the Scottish Police Authority was briefed about the new Scotland-wide firearms policy under the single police force one year ago or as soon as the policy was decided?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Police (Carrying of Firearms)"}, {"date": "2014-05-13", "body": "<p>In February 2007, a constituent of mine was one of the first people to have a mesh implant.

I thank James Dornan for lodging the motion to celebrate the 15th birthday of the charity Glasgow the Caring City. I also thank the Rev Neil Galbraith, whom I have known for many years. James Dornan informed us that the charity is based in his constituency, and it is in my region of Glasgow.</p><p>I have had the privilege of travelling with Neil Galbraith in a number of countries as he carried out charitable work. The charity has supported a range of health, education and security programmes worldwide. Among the prominent examples of the charity&#8217;s influence is its funding of schools around the world. I will cite one or two examples that will show how Glasgow the Caring City has carried out that work.</p><p>It is indeed a charity that cares. It works in many countries throughout the world. To give members a flavour, the countries that, to my knowledge, the charity has engaged with include Cuba, India, Pakistan, South Sudan, Uganda and Scotland.</p><p>Let me give two examples of the charity&#8217;s work in Scotland. When the factory in Firhill in Glasgow exploded and when Glasgow airport was attacked, it provided blankets and water instantaneously, and a lot of hard work was done by its volunteers.</p><p>The charity has also helped schools in Glasgow, including in Hillhead, where I was a councillor. The charity assisted the secondary school there with funding and support for its twin school in Lahore in Pakistan. The charity has also supported countries such as Malawi and Sri Lanka, particularly following the tsunami in Sri Lanka.</p><p>We can see the practical results of that work around the world. For example, I had the privilege of going to Sri Lanka during the Commonwealth games, and I know that the Sri Lankan community was very proud to say that they knew of Scotland and Glasgow because of the charity work that we had done for them. They did not know of Nigeria, because it was nowhere to be seen. I am sure that the Nigerian people supported the Sri Lankan community, but I am not sure to what extent. However, the Sri Lankan community certainly remembered the work that Glasgow the Caring City did. That is a tribute to Neil Galbraith, because he was very active in Sri Lanka and worked very hard. In fact, I was concerned about his health when I saw him&#8212;I felt that he was overdoing it, but that is the nature of the business that he is in.</p><p>One of the other charities in Glasgow that do a tremendous amount of work around the world is the Ucare Foundation, which funds schools around the world. Another is Islamic Relief, which is renowned for its work around the world and which has been supported by the Scottish Government on occasion in rebuilding and refurbishing schools and stocking them with equipment to provide children with the quality of education that they deserve, for which it is to be congratulated. Most recently, Islamic Relief has worked in Afghanistan and Iraq, which are in a very troubled part of the world. I believe that our charities do a tremendous amount of work, and I am really proud of that.</p><p>Glasgow the Caring City has also worked with Rescue 1122, which provides fire and rescue services in Punjab. Rescue 1122 was twinned with the Strathclyde Fire and Rescue. Fire engines from Glasgow were delivered to Lahore, contributing immensely to the saving of life and limb and property. Such small measures go a very long way in supporting people, who appreciate the help and support that they get from other people around the world.</p><p>When I first realised that it was the 15th birthday of Glasgow the Caring City and that a parliamentary motion was to be lodged, I was pleased. It brought a smile to my face because I genuinely feel that we do not say thank you enough to the volunteers and donors who make it possible to support people at very short notice. I take this opportunity to say a huge public thank you to industry and all the private businesses, volunteers and individuals who make an immense contribution to charity and the charity movement in Scotland. That helps to make our charities matter and succeed around the world, which is very important.</p><p>I congratulate Glasgow the Caring City, and I congratulate Neil Galbraith on all his hard work. I hope and pray that he will continue it in the future.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow the Caring City"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p></p><p>2.

These events, which enrich us on a daily basis, take place all over the country throughout the year.</p><p>I have seen it time and again that when these small groups apply for funding in councils and various other places they are written off because they are too small and are not important enough. Believe me, those events are where it all starts. They are where people find their niche. They then want to continue to do these things all their life and support other activities throughout the country. Sometimes we underestimate their value. I particularly want to thank all those people who make such a huge effort on a weekly basis to support their young people to engage in community events and festivals up and down Scotland.</p><p>Over the past year I have been involved in many events where the community gets together and celebrates all that Glasgow has to offer. The quality of the gigs encourages visitors to keep coming all year round, every year. That is important. It is not just about small events in communities; we also want to share our festivals with other people.</p><p>On the face of it, getting people to come to Glasgow in January to listen to traditional music sounds like a big ask, but Celtic Connections continues to go from strength to strength. That is a huge achievement.</p><p>A festival that is close to my heart is the Glasgow mela, which has been happening since the early 1990s. Glasgow Life plays a key role in the organisation of the mela every year. The mela celebrates Glasgow and Scotland&#8217;s diverse communities and multicultural society, and it has become so popular that there is a waiting list for people who want to participate, who come from all over the UK&#8212;despite the fact that it gets rained off every second year.</p><p>The mela could not have become so successful without the tremendous support of Glasgow City Council over the past 20 or so years, which I witnessed when I was a councillor in Glasgow. It is also supported by many other organisations, which is wonderful, because I like to see such things eventually become self-sufficient. It started as an ethnic minority mela, but it is now Glasgow mela and it attracts a rich and diverse group of participants. It is a fantastic event.</p><p>People sometimes wonder whether all that activity happens because we are part of the UK or because of local spirit. I know that the minority community has copied many events from down south and adapted them to Scottish design and culture. That shows the spirit among Scottish communities; we might import things from other parts of the world but we tend to adapt them to our culture. That is wonderful, because it shows how we celebrate diversity, taking up what other communities do and creating a brand new cultural activity.</p><p>The Indian Bollywood industry frequently comes to Scotland to make films, as do the Lollywood film companies, from Lahore in Pakistan. When the film makers come, they tap into the talents of the local community, which can offer something different from what is available in their home towns. We can offer something unique, even though it might be similar to the traditions elsewhere. The expertise and skill of our young people is amazing, and what they can offer is fantastic. Perhaps that is why people from many countries come to make films in Glasgow and in Scotland&#8217;s countryside.</p><p>Festivals are important, because they add so much richness to people&#8217;s lives. I ask the cabinet secretary to make a commitment to the people of Scotland that the Government will not cut funding for such activities but strive to find resources to support them. That would be fantastic. I do not expect the cabinet secretary to give me figures just now&#8212;I would not dare put her on the spot. I simply echo the wishes of all the people who put on festivals on a shoestring. They really need support from councils and the Government, so I am sure that support would be very welcome.</p><p>I have had the privilege of travelling around the world and I assure members that no one can match our festivals in Scotland. We should be proud of that. That is why I always thank all those relatives who do so much to develop children&#8217;s skills.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>I welcome the opportunity to talk about the legacy of the 20th Commonwealth games in Glasgow. I think everyone here will agree that the games have been a tremendous success.</p><p>I thank the minister for her announcement with regard to facilities for para-sports and the additional money. She will be a bit disappointed that I am not criticising her today, but this is a special day.</p><p>As someone who has had the privilege of watching and playing a part in the long journey from the original bid to the closing ceremony, I have a few observations to make.</p><p>One of the things that struck me most was the spirit of working together by all, which made me very proud. That was shown once again, as it always is, in the hospitality and friendship that the people of Glasgow offered people from right across Scotland and around the world.</p><p>From the start of bidding for the games, Glasgow City Council was given a substantial amount of support from a broad network of embassies, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British Council, as well as friends all over the world. That was not only unique, but made the games inclusive. It was very clear that by coming together and working as a team we could make the games a success, as we have demonstrated.</p><p>In this day and age, every time there is an international sporting event the hosts are often challenged by resources and in terms of co-operation from others. We have been extremely lucky in that regard. We have not had an opportunity to thank some of the agencies that worked internationally for us, for their hard work.</p><p>Another important aspect was the role that was played by Glasgow City Council and, indeed, by councillors, officials and businesspeople&#8212;not only in Glasgow, but across Scotland and in other parts of the UK, as well as by the previous First Minister, Jack McConnell, whose vision and leadership ensured that all the relevant funds were in place, regardless of which Government would be in power when the games happened. I want to thank him personally for what he did. I know that people including him, Patricia Ferguson, Archie Graham, council leaders and the council itself put in a lot of work; I think that we sometimes underestimate the value of the contribution that is made by people behind closed doors, and I pay tribute to them this afternoon.</p><p>While watching the gymnastics, I was not only impressed by the excellent performance of the athletes, but was struck by the friendship between the gymnasts of the home countries and the support that they were giving each other. After all, many of the young men had trained together in team GB. I certainly would not want to undervalue the support that team GB gave our athletes; in fact, I welcome it, and I hope that we will continue to receive it.</p><p>The efforts of the people of Glasgow in general and the volunteers in particular were amazing in welcoming visitors and other volunteers from around the UK. I particularly want to thank the athletes&#8217; parents.</p><p>Parents make a huge personal effort and contribution that we cannot pay for or even comprehend. They get up day in, day out, seven days a week, to give their young people every opportunity to be successful, and they incur great expense in paying for travel, clothing, fees and the other costs that are associated with clubs. What they do is tremendous, and I take my hat off to them. I also want to thank the schools and colleges for their role in supporting the athletes&#8217; success.</p><p>There was a very positive mood to the games that not even the rain could wash away. It was fantastic. I have to say that we were very lucky that God also gave us some good weather so that everyone could appreciate that it does not only rain in Scotland and that we sometimes get the sun.</p><p>If we are to secure a lasting legacy for the games, we need to harness that positive strength and not waste it waiting for whatever else might come along. The skills that Glasgow has learned should allow it to bid for other national and international events, such as the European football championship.</p><p>We must be proud of our athletes&#8217; fantastic achievement in the Commonwealth games. The home countries won 20 per cent of the medals, while Australia managed to win only 10 per cent, but the challenge that faces us when we go to Australia is at least to match, if not enhance, our medal tally. I am happy to wish Australia every success&#8212;I hope that I am invited to some of the events&#8212;but I have to say that my wish is only that it has a successful games, not that it wins more medals.

The inquiry was valuable, in that we heard the views of many expert witnesses on what EU membership would mean for an independent Scotland. It certainly succeeded in taking the discussions and the debate to another level. I suspect that we will see many of the issues that were discussed coming to the fore in public debate, whatever the result of the referendum, as the UK&#8217;s membership of the EU, and the terms of that membership, come under increasing scrutiny.</p><p>In drawing the debate to a close, I would like to address some of the points that have been made this afternoon.</p><p>The report is a presentation of substantial amounts evidence that were gathered during the inquiry. I note with sadness that several sections of the report are disputed. The report clearly states that the pro-union members of the committee wished to keep the original draft of the report and felt that SNP amendments compromised the report&#8217;s impartial tone.</p><p>On the issue of there being no clear answers, as no section of a member state of the EU has become an independent state before, there is no legal precedent, and evidence that was given to the inquiry states that there is no treaty that gives us a clear way forward. The report gives us a summary of the informed opinion of a wide range of experts.</p><p>On the issue of the Edinburgh agreement, the agreement is mainly about the terms of the referendum on Scotland&#8217;s future and nothing else. The UK is not planning to do anything other than support that process.</p><p>There is no clarity on the amount of time that will be taken.</p><p>On the route to EU membership, the white paper stated that article 48 of the Treaty on European Union would be used instead of article 49, with a more simplified process of ordinary treaty amendment to achieve Scottish membership. In response to that, I quote Professor Michael Keating. Responding to my question on whether there was any guarantee that article 48 would be used, he said:</p><p>&#8220;There is no legal guarantee.&#8221;</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;All of that is in flux and all that we can do is make a reasonable judgment on the balance of interests and how the legal questions can be dealt with. We cannot give guarantees.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, European and External Relations Committee, 5 December 2013; c 1563, 1565.]</p><p>In other words, he clearly said that there is no guarantee.</p><p>One of the areas covered by the inquiry that I considered to be important was what would happen if there was any gap in Scotland&#8217;s membership of the European Union. It was clear from the evidence that that would have widespread implications for European Union citizens and businesses. The 160,000 nationals of other EU member states who live in Scotland would no longer be living within the EU, and those with Scottish citizenship living elsewhere in the EU would lose their rights as EU citizens. It was clear from the evidence that, if Scotland was no longer part of the single market, with Scottish businesses unable to trade freely with EU states and businesses in other EU member states unable to trade freely with Scotland, the gap would damage Scotland&#8217;s interests.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Independent Scotland (European Union Membership)"}, {"date": "2014-06-04", "body": "<p>It is nice of the member to join us. That is the best that I can say.</p><p>In their speeches, members have demonstrated what an important issue European Union membership is for Scotland. Whatever our differences in our views on how Scotland might become a member state in its own right in the event of independence, I think that we are all united on one thing: Scotland should be a member of the European Union and should benefit as much as possible from that membership.</p><p>The recent European Parliament elections showed that there is a high degree of dissatisfaction with the European Union in its current form. The European Parliament will have its highest number of Eurosceptic members ever. The European Union is now reflecting on how it can change after those elections. The evidence heard by us as part of our inquiry suggests that the people of Scotland look more favourably on EU membership than people in other parts of the UK do.</p><p>The importance of Scotland engaging with the European Union emerged strongly from the inquiry. Scotland has a lot to contribute to, and gain from, the EU. We need to maximise the opportunities that European membership provides us with, whether those are funding opportunities, opportunities to engage in European policy making and projects or opportunities to participate in European networks.</p><p>One of the key themes of the committee&#8217;s inquiry was how small states can engage with the European Union. Much of what we learned about the way that small states can influence is relevant to Scotland, either currently or as an independent country.

Historically, Scotland is known for producing skilful and original individuals. Furthermore, Scotland is rightfully proud of its excellent education system, and our universities are among the best in the world.</p><p>Over the past decade, Scottish universities have experienced an increase in the number of Scottish, European Union and international students. Current figures indicate that Scotland has a higher share of students from countries outside the UK attending a form of higher education than the UK as a whole has. That speaks volumes for our education system, and it gives me an opportunity to thank all the teachers, lecturers and professors in Scotland for their dedication and the hard work that they do for our students and students from overseas.</p><p>However, the basic fact is that undergraduate degrees take a year longer in Scotland than they do in England and Wales, and no one can tell me that having to pay an additional year&#8217;s worth of fees and living costs to study in Scotland has no influence on the decision that students make about whether to study here.</p><p>Another point to bear in mind is the fact that the excellent international reputation of the British higher education system as a whole benefits us. A survey that was carried out by Chinese students among 200 overseas students at four Scottish universities found that 46 per cent of the non-EU nationals who were surveyed said that they would be less likely to choose a university in an independent Scotland because they wanted to get a British degree. That surprised me. More than a third of them feared that a Scottish degree would not be considered to be as valuable as a British degree. I suppose that that needs to be put to the test; nevertheless, there is a perception that a British degree would be more valuable.</p><p>Many students automatically begin their search for a course by contacting the British Council or a British embassy. They look through all the courses that are provided by British universities and apply for one that meets their needs. At present, Scottish higher education institutions can identify themselves as being part of that British system, but if Scotland leaves the UK, it will no longer have the benefit of the extensive network of embassies and British Council offices in 170 countries around the world.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Immigration Policy (Higher Education)"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>The minister will appreciate that Canada had an option to separate and it did not.</p><p>There is absolutely no doubt that having such a large number of outlets gives us an advantage.</p><p>I agree with what Humza Yousaf said about the difficulties with immigration issues, but the Scottish Government cut the marketing budget for India and Pakistan, which did not help because, at the end of the day, it is all about marketing.

Generally, more information is now available, but issues remain about how people access it. Families are unaware of the support to which they are entitled and where they can go to get information. As a consequence, they do not get all the help that they really need. Scottish learning disability awareness week is a great way to combat the issue of awareness.</p><p>I especially want to mention Thomas Fortune work centre in Glasgow, which has recently secured five-year funding from the Glasgow learning disability partnership, with the likelihood of an extension. Only 5 per cent of people with learning disabilities in Glasgow are in paid employment; the centre, which specialises in providing a route to employment and meeting the social support needs of people with learning disabilities, is one of the very few projects in Scotland that provide a bridge between social care and open employment. I should also mention the Glasgow Disability Alliance, which is led by disabled people and has a membership of more than 1,500.</p><p>People with learning difficulties in minority communities face double discrimination in accessing public services. The advice that I would offer in that respect is that local shops, faith and community leaders and centres and organisations such as Enable Scotland can be used to pass on information.

Who is it for and is it fit for purpose? When the homecoming was launched, I thought that it was a great idea. Labour successfully launched homecoming Scotland 2009, which created jobs and added to our economy. In some areas, Scotland is doing well to build on that success. We are making a lot of effort to market Scotland&#8217;s image overseas, but it feels as though, at home, we are not really bothering. When I asked constituents how they felt about homecoming 2014, the answer was, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; which speaks volumes.

That has left me unimpressed, as it tells me that much more can be done. This is supposed to be a year for Scotland to reinforce its position on the international stage as a dynamic and creative nation. In 2014, Scotland will be on the world stage as never before, yet Scotland is being unoriginal and is not fully capitalising on opportunities that this year brings.</p><p>Individual events in Scotland have had a good level of success already this year. Celtic Connections, the Ryder cup, the Edinburgh festival and the Commonwealth games are only a few of the already successful brands that are included in homecoming 2014. I find little evidence that homecoming 2014 is adding more value to many of those events, which is why I feel it should pay attention to newer events.</p><p>Homecoming 2014 cannot have a brass neck and take credit for all the Scottish events of 2014; it can only take credit for the events that it has a role in.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Homecoming Scotland 2014"}, {"date": "2014-05-15", "body": "<p>At best, that evidence was a little shady.

With Scotland as a committed member of the United Kingdom, we will all be bound to put forward our political arguments in that spirit, and that will be a healthy thing.</p><p>The long campaign that has already run has re-energised my party in our belief in an idea that is bigger than independence. It involves the pooling and sharing of resources across the UK; a strong Scottish Parliament that is backed up by the strength and security of partnership; and social progress and change here in Scotland and across the UK. That remains an idea and an ideal that is worthy of the Labour movement.</p><p>The campaign has been a long one. Throughout 300 years of union, voices have been raised for repeal. All my life, this question has been the dividing line of Scottish politics. For some on the other side, it has been a motivation that has driven lifelong political activism. Over the past seven years, Government has in our view been on pause but, in the SNP&#8217;s view, it has been preparing for the next four weeks and for the day when Scotland will decide its future.</p><p>We on this side of the chamber can acknowledge the achievement of nationalists in getting to this point, even if they have failed to convince us of their case. We will all welcome an answer to the question, and we are committed to putting this Parliament back to work in the nation&#8217;s interest, whatever the result.</p><p>I hope that the debate that will continue, not in the Scottish Parliament but in the homes, schools and workplaces of Scotland, will be worthy of us all. The Government motion makes, by and large, familiar arguments. After all, independence was the nationalists&#8217; answer when the great Labour Government of 1945 was building our welfare state. It was their answer when the previous Labour Government created this Parliament and embarked on its quest to tackle child poverty and build a fairer economy. It was their answer when the banks were booming and when the banks went bust. Today we heard little that is new. We heard the same arguments, which have been rehearsed over so many decades but are soon to be settled.</p><p>Our questions have been consistent throughout two and a half years of campaigning. How is the enormous risk to our public finances, which independent experts have identified, to be managed? How do the admirable ideas about a better society, to which we should all aspire, square against corporation tax cuts and the creation of competition on this island, which will inevitably lead to a race to the bottom, for Scots and our neighbours? What are the set-up costs? What will be the cost of renegotiated European Union membership? How can it be that postal voting will begin in just days but a party that has campaigned for an independent Scottish state for nearly 90 years cannot tell us what its plan is if a currency union, which is not in the SNP&#8217;s gift, is not agreed to?</p><p>What is the principle behind breaking up so many of our institutions and starting afresh, when there is so little evidence that people&#8217;s hopes and aspirations in life differ greatly on either side of the Tweed? Are Englishmen and Scots really so different that no form of Government between our nations can be made to work? Are our values so different from those of the Welsh that they preclude any adjustment of our partnership such that we can continue to live together under different devolved Governments but within one union? Is the desire of people in Belfast for recognition of national differences so far removed from the sense of identity of Glaswegians, Highlanders, Borderers and Aberdonians that we cannot share citizenship in a United Kingdom?</p><p>I acknowledge the right of nationalists to put the case that nationhood must be demonstrated by independence. I even accept that some nationalists will carry on making that case even if the nation tells them that it does not agree. I also acknowledge that not everyone who is arguing for a yes vote is a nationalist. I hope that many of those people will put the enthusiasm that they have found in this debate back into the mundane old world away from constitutional politics&#8212;those questions of decent housing, fair pay and the chance to better our lives and those of those around us.</p><p>A positive choice to work together is the best option for Scotland. The existence and extension of devolution mean that Scotland can have the best of both worlds. The struggle to make Britain better governed and a better place to live is a bigger idea than the idea of withdrawing into ourselves. To say that the Tories can never be defeated is the politics of despair, just as to say that Tories do not and will not exist in Scotland is conceit.</p><p>Time is running out in the debate and in the campaign. For many months we have heard the Scottish Government make the case for freedom, armed with focus groups, unhearing of those who do not agree with it. The challenge for us all over the next four weeks is to put the case as well as it deserves to be put, for tomorrow&#8217;s generation, so that when today is history they will be able to discern the honest disagreement that there was among us and understand the decision that we took.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm mentioned the national health service. Labour has a special attachment to the national health service. It is Labour&#8217;s greatest achievement in office and our biggest task is always to defend it. However, the NHS does not belong just to the Labour Party; it belongs to people throughout Britain. Devolution allows us to steer our own course, but the ideals of the NHS are burned deeply in our sense of who we are whether the service is administered from Cardiff, Belfast, London or Edinburgh.</p><p>There are ideals on either side of the debate, and to pretend, when all the arguments for independence have fallen away, that the cause is somehow the defence of our national health service is to cheapen the value that is placed on Britain&#8217;s greatest achievements, across the nations of the UK. Indeed, it is to dishonour the genuine and heartfelt arguments that nationalists have made for an independent Scotland over many decades.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>I hope and believe that Scotland will choose partnership over disunion on 18 September, and I hope that that is done on the basis of an honest evaluation of the merits of the arguments.

I hope that the range of views that no doubt exists in the Parliament will have the opportunity of an airing this evening. In drafting a motion that I hoped as many members as possible could support and which would therefore stand a chance of reaching the chamber for debate, I tried to provide a form of words that would gain the broadest possible support. I hope that this debate will play a small part in a much-needed effort to assure the victims of this conflict of the greatest possible international coalition for peace and justice in the middle east.</p><p>I draw attention to my membership of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on Palestine, of which I have previously been an officer, and I thank the current officers Sandra White, Claudia Beamish and Jim Hume for supporting my motion. I look forward to their contributions to the debate. I also refer members to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests as a former member of the Scottish Trades Union Congress general council, as I will refer to the delegation to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories that I joined while I was a member.</p><p>In Scotland, as elsewhere in the world, there are a range of views on the solutions to the problems of the middle east and specifically those of Israel and Palestine. Parliament should reflect those if we wish our voices to be representative of the country and of note to those elsewhere. There are few neutral voices. However, the scale of the current and most recent violence, to which we are all bearing witness, and indeed the length of time for which the conflict has gone on have meant that there is a breadth to the voices that say that the current actions of the Israeli Government have been disproportionate. There are instances of action that require international investigation and indeed an international response that goes beyond simply wishing for talks or for different partners in the cause of peace.</p><p>I am a supporter of a Palestinian state. I believe that a viable state for the Palestinians is their right and that it is the duty of progressive voices around the world to advocate for it with resolution, with realism about the barriers to it and with firmness against those who frustrate the two-state solution on either side, whether in principle or by delay.</p><p>I believe that the current violence and the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is winning new supporters for the cause of justice and peace, not terrorism and not military action. The motion that we are debating condemns the scale of the violence on both sides. I condemn utterly and without caveat the indiscriminate firing of rockets into Israel from Gaza, I condemn tunnelling into Israeli territory from Gaza, and I believe that the fear and danger that they represent serves no purpose other than the prolonging of the conflict, which reduces the likelihood that Israelis will question the actions of their Government, far less become advocates for engagement with their Palestinian neighbours. Correspondingly, the scale of the horror in Gaza does nothing to bolster the voices of those who recognise that a viable Palestinian state can be achieved only alongside a secure Israel and that it will be created through negotiation of land, not violence against civilians.</p><p>Peace for one society and normality for individuals and families will not be lasting if it is achieved only for one group. That is not a justification for violence. It is simply recognition that the underlying issues of the conflict continue. I visited northern Israel in the aftermath of operation cast lead and, like many other international visitors, I have been shown the rockets that come over the border from Gaza. I have spoken to Israelis about their fears of attack and I have no doubt that those fears are genuine. I have also spoken to Palestinians and international observers who have told me of the harsh and brutal reality of life under blockade in Gaza.</p><p>The images that we now see on our television screens, about which people are taking to our streets to protest, offend the world. Schools and hospitals that the innocent can only hope are places of safety have become a battlefield that is raging on a strip of land that is one of the most densely populated places on earth. Civilians and children have been killed and injured in their thousands.</p><p>To those who say that we need to step back from condemnation of the disproportion of the violence because it needs to be understood against the wider politics of the region, the dispute or the history of the peace process, I say that we should imagine being born into the world on the Gaza strip. Imagine the hopelessness of parents as they look at their children and imagine the desperate future that stretches far beyond the tiny horizons that surround them.</p><p>I have no doubt that others will use their time to talk about their reactions to what we are watching. The agony is perhaps more profound now than it has ever been before, but the truth is that much of what we will hear in the debate could have been said in any of the three years since I was elected to the Parliament; it has been said in the more than 10 years for which I have been actively involved in campaigns and it has been continually said in the 30 years of my life and long before that.</p><p>I hope that others will touch on the injustices that continue on the west bank, where Hamas is not in control, and I have no doubt that others will mention many of the advocates for the Palestinians who have put the case for change in the middle east better than I ever could, including the late Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Tutu and former President Carter.</p><p>The truth is that, while the world desperately desires a lasting ceasefire to the current violence, the hope&#8212;the necessity&#8212;of a two-state solution is fast disappearing before our eyes. The situation is desperate, but the world simply cannot allow hope to die with the children of Gaza.</p><p>Time does not allow me to say all that I wish to, but I will end my speech, as the motion does, by urging the Scottish Government to continue its efforts to do all that it can for good community relations in our country. Members of our minority communities feel the pain of this conflict keenly and they deserve our solidarity, just as the innocent civilian victims in the middle east deserve our resolve in speaking out.</p><p>When I have asked ordinary Palestinians what Scots can do and what any of us can do as witnesses, I have been told, &#8220;Do not forget us. Do not forget that we exist.&#8221; When those who believe in a two-state solution speak out, that should not be described as support for terrorism, which is condemned by our citizens and by those around the world who believe that there is no violent solution to the political problem that exists in the occupied territories. When we tell our children what the United Nations flag represents, they should be proud of it, not compromised by it.</p><p>I hope that the message that goes out from the Scottish Parliament and from the debate is one of humanity. We see what exists and we recognise that it is unjust. The leaders of the world will continue to reflect on the steps that can be taken internationally, but the citizens of the world are making it clear that, in our individual actions, we will protest against bombardment and terrorism until lasting peace prevails and demands for justice are met. [Applause.]</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>It is a pleasure to take part in this debate and to follow the enthusiasm of Sandra White. I echo the thanks to the minister. I could not have thought of a better highlight of the last weekend than the one that she was able to enjoy on all our behalf by presenting the medals after the men&#8217;s cycling road race at Glasgow Green. I thank the city council, all the partners, the organising committee and all the various officials and organisations and the media. I do not know whether our parliamentary link, Kenny Stewart, is in the gallery, but I think we will all miss his e-mail invitations to pose with a giant inflatable shoe or high-five Clyde or put our hard hats on for a venue tour.</p><p>I thank the volunteers, including Patricia Ferguson and John Mason. I think it says a lot about Patricia Ferguson that she volunteered her time in the back rooms at Glasgow after being part of the successful bid and presenting medals herself in Melbourne. Our amendment refers to the thousands of ordinary people who gave up their time to do the same. I agree that we need to think about how we follow up their superb contribution. Those I met came from all over Scotland and all over the UK and many of them had been volunteers at Manchester and London. It is clear that there is a momentum there that will keep going.</p><p>There are too many people to mention, although Sandra White gave it a good shot. I would mention the bus drivers who took us to and from the venues; the bus marshals who lost their voices trying to get us on the buses; the train and taxi drivers; the police; the men and women who brought their Scottie dogs to the opening ceremony; the woman in the George Square ticket office who helped me on the morning of the opening ceremony to get my tickets; and the city parks department, which made sure that the city looked its best and that every public space in the centre of Glasgow was decked with flowers.</p><p>Of course, the event was about athletes, and our biggest thanks must go to them and their supporting teams for putting on such a show. We should thank those who came from all over the Commonwealth, the home nations and, indeed, team Scotland, who did us proud with, as the cabinet secretary has pointed out, a record haul of medals.</p><p>The success of the games was measured against our expectations and the preparations that were made for them. I do not think that I ever doubted that Glasgow would deliver, and was therefore not surprised when it did. I am certainly not overawed by the fact that it had the best games ever; Glaswegians knew that our city would shine, whether in the sun or in the rain, and the people of Glasgow, gallus and generous as they are, made these games. Regardless of which party we belong to, those of us who have the privilege of representing the city have rightly been proud to do so this summer.</p><p>The relationship between politics and sport is a curious one, and it is right that we sought to protect the competitors from being asked for their views on the referendum at every turn. However, the games happened because political leaders got behind sporting visionaries to bring them to Glasgow, and the kind of lasting legacy that is often talked about in relation to major sporting events but which is rarely delivered will come only if we politicians back up the volunteers in our sports clubs and support our least active citizens in making their own way to healthier lives. The back-up&#8212;and, frankly, the money&#8212;comes only because of political decisions.</p><p>In short, the games might not have been about politics, but their legacy is all about politics. My constituents in the east end and across Glasgow who feared that the games would be something that happened to other people are now looking to not only the Scottish Government but all of us to deliver on the promises that were made. Those of us who supported the games and had thought through the planning knew about the cynics out there who were unconvinced that this would be money well spent or that it would be worth the disruption, and it was the vision of the legacy as much as the success of the sporting event itself that ensured such a high level of public support when the games opened. We really have a responsibility now not to let those people down. I welcome every announcement that the cabinet secretary has made and every programme that she is supporting, but the political determination to change lives and raise our eyes must be sustained beyond the athletes parade. I have no doubt that the cabinet secretary herself shares that view.</p><p>Physical activity is Scotland&#8217;s biggest public health challenge, and a huge part of the solution is to encourage participation in sport from the youngest age. Children must have the opportunity to try&#8212;and to like or dislike&#8212;as many sports as possible until they find something that might be part of their lives for ever. In that respect, physical literacy is key; skills such as running, jumping, swimming, throwing and catching are not just for games and sports but for living a fuller life. Having confidence in those basic skills will enable us to return to such activities at any time in our lives, regardless of our fitness levels or our commitment to competitive sport.</p><p>In the days following the games, I was pleased to see Scottish Swimming promoting its every child can swim campaign, which is something that I feel very strongly about. Swimming is too often missed when we talk about physical literacy; in fact, as some of the team Scotland medallists have been making clear in an online video that was released this week, it is a life skill. For a start, we live on an island, but the fact is that too many children in this country are still being seriously injured or drowned as a result of accidents in open waterways. In that respect, a fitting legacy of the games would be a long-term commitment to teaching all of our children to swim not only for enjoyment, fitness and sport but because it could get them out of danger. Like riding a bike, the ability to swim, once learned, never leaves us, and it is the perfect activity to turn to as we get older and our ability to exercise vigorously decreases.</p><p>As Patricia Ferguson has made clear, walking is also being promoted as an activity for those who are least active and who wish to improve their mobility, fitness or health&#8212;indeed, it has been described as the best prescription for a healthier life&#8212;and I hope and expect that the cabinet secretary will continue to encourage such activity in a way that promotes lifelong activity. Giving children these skills at the youngest age allows them to return to such activities later on, but we also need to provide entry-level activities that can be gateways for people who take up such activity only later in life.</p><p>I do not really have time to go into the whole issue of facilities. All I will say is that they are fantastic. Notwithstanding what Liz Smith has said about swimming pools&#8212;and I absolutely agree with her that amazing things can be achieved without facilities&#8212;there is no doubt that the increased availability of 50m pools across the country has helped the success of Scottish swimming at Tollcross.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>Finally, I have a suggestion that I hope that the cabinet secretary will consider.

That will have the effect of making it easier to trace the landlords responsible should disturbance to neighbours become an issue as a result of very short-term letting. It will also mean that landlords who seek to operate holiday businesses in what are otherwise residential buildings will be subject to a fit-and-proper-person test.</p><p>By way of very brief background, my motivation for the amendments in group 5 has been the experience of many of my constituents in Glasgow city centre who have had the enjoyment of their homes severely limited by the letting of neighbouring flats, which has resulted in severe and sustained antisocial behaviour, noise nuisance and problems in maintaining common areas.</p><p>At a meeting with members of the Beresford residents committee on Monday, I was told of how some guests at these properties seemed to be under the impression that the residents&#8217; concierge in their building was in fact a hotel porter. In itself, that might not be a very serious issue but it illustrates the point that many of the guests who book such properties are entirely unaware that they are in fact hiring rooms in a building in which others have their homes.</p><p>None of my amendments seek to ban very short-term holiday letting; they are about a sensible level of regulation, which will ensure that the use of one person&#8217;s property or number of properties does not have an impact upon others that restricts their ability to enjoy their home and which results in police being called regularly.</p><p>Amendment 48 was previously rejected by Government members at the committee stage. It seeks to extend the power of closure of party flats to local authorities. The power to close is not a new one and clear criteria already exist as to when such a last resort action is appropriate&#8212;when there are persistent issues of antisocial behaviour relating to a particular property and when the authorities think that continued operation is likely to result in further nuisance to neighbours.</p><p>At present, that power resides only with the police. My proposal is simply to extend that power to include councils, which are likely to be better informed than the police about the issues that are occurring regularly and the extent to which landlords have been prepared to help resolve them. Crucially, I think that councils have more time than the police to take proportionate action in support of long-term solutions rather than simply address the situation as it exists when a police officer is called.</p><p>Amendment 67 is a straightforward consequential amendment so I will not take up Parliament&#8217;s time on it.</p><p>I move amendment 45.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>I understand the minister&#8217;s principal objection, which is that existing law already allows most of those problems to be resolved.

However, they made it clear to me that issues remain where landlords are unco-operative and unwilling to engage in finding a solution.</p><p>Officials from the council are in the Parliament today; they recognise that my amendments could result in more work, but they are willing to do that work to restore the quality of life for those who are affected.</p><p>None of the amendments that I have lodged are prescriptive.

Regulations under the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004 mean that the types of dwellings to be registered would remain entirely in the gift of ministers, so Alex Johnstone&#8217;s concern that the provision would be too broad could be factored into the guidance that will be produced if the amendment is successful.

The principal amendment in the group is amendment 51. Amendment 70 would ensure that the detail of regulation provided under amendment 51 would be subject to further parliamentary scrutiny under the affirmative procedure.</p><p>The argument for enhanced enforcement areas has been made in the briefing that has been provided to all members by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. In a nutshell, areas where enhanced enforcement powers should be available are those where local authorities and, indeed, local communities have identified persistent problems in the rental sector that are difficult to resolve and require a range of measures rather than one-off or discrete policy solutions. There are areas where a number of rogue private sector landlords are contributors to wider problems such as multiple repair and management failures that affect not just their tenants but the wider community in which their businesses operate.</p><p>The power that is proposed is discretionary, time limited and targeted. Enhanced enforcement is not about a broader increase in regulatory power but about a recognition that in some places there are exceptional circumstances that justify a response that would not be considered proportionate if it was applied everywhere. I have no expectation that anything other than a small number of applications for enhanced enforcement area status would be forthcoming, and it would be for Scottish ministers to determine whether applications would be granted.</p><p>The kinds of enhanced provisions that I have in mind, which COSLA has discussed with the Scottish Government, include criminal record checks on individuals seeking to register as landlords, powers of entry and powers to inspect documents. In amendment 51 I have left the exact detail of what powers could be granted and in what circumstances to the Scottish ministers to determine, because the amendment is about responding to exceptional local circumstances.</p><p>Housing should provide homes for individuals and families; it should not be a source of exploitation of tenants or other criminality.

One of the most fascinating things that I have found is the need that is felt by those who support independence to explain to themselves and particularly to those of us who are saying no thanks why we hold the view that we do.</p><p>As Nicola Sturgeon set out in her opening speech&#8212;she repeated the same old lines&#8212;the nationalists tell us that it must be because we do not understand the issues and have not thought enough about independence.

That is where the political debate should be.</p><p>The case that Labour has put before the Parliament and the issues that are highlighted in Johann Lamont&#8217;s motion take us to the fundamentals: whether ordinary people will be better or worse off. That should not be based solely on an economic analysis, but it is the territory where politicians most usefully assist the public who, after all, will be the decision makers in the matter.</p><p>The debate needs to be returned to the issues of substance rather than simply a case of imagining answers to questions that were never asked, building up straw men, as Mark McDonald did, using slogans and making promises without price tags.</p><p>There are real and serious questions that those who promote independence have completely failed to answer, most notably on the currency, but also on Europe, public finances and jobs. Annabel Goldie made the point that asking those questions is not negative and denying that they are important or asserting that definitive answers have already been given when they have not is just not helpful.</p><p>When the questions are denied or diverted, it leads the rest of us to the conclusion that, for some, independence is desirable whether or not it makes Scotland a better place. It suggests that many of the things that are advanced as reasons for independence are not actually reasons at all. Instead, independence is the reason for the policies that the Government promotes.</p><p>I understand that nationalism might not be the starting point of everyone who supports a yes vote, but I suspect that it is still a major driver for many in the SNP. Scotland free no matter what and no matter the cost is a view that I find fundamentally unattractive.</p><p>That leads me to the worry that, when it comes to the detail, too many of the policies are not properly worked out and to the concern that some on the yes side will say anything to get over the line in September.</p><p>We have seen more of that this afternoon. The Trident funding pledge prize that has become a part of every one of these debates must go today to George Adam, who told us that what was apparently announced as a self-funding childcare policy is now to be funded by cutting Trident.</p><p>I will turn to some of the other issues that have been raised. Members such as Kezia Dugdale, Richard Simpson and Sarah Boyack set out their concerns about public services should Scotland decide to end devolution and the basis on which we pool and share our resources across the whole United Kingdom.</p><p>Labour members have argued that Scotland can enjoy the best of both worlds, with a strong Scottish Parliament focused on the defence and improvement of our public services while being backed up by the strength and security of being part of a partnership with England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>No one denies that slogans can be helpful in politics. The problem is when somebody&#8217;s politics are only a slogan.</p><p>The evidence that we have heard from many of the experts who have looked at Scotland&#8217;s public finances tells us two things. First, an independent Scotland would begin from a worse financial position than the rest of the UK, and secondly, if our existing public services are to be maintained&#8212;never mind the many promises that have been made on how much better everything else will be&#8212;we will either need to make cuts or raise taxes, or both.</p><p>The IFS has stated:</p><p>&#8220;Our calculations suggest that an independent Scotland could expect to be running a deficit of around 5% of GDP in 2016/17, which would be larger than that facing the UK as a whole, and would necessitate tax rises or spending cuts.&#8221;</p><p>The CPPR has said:</p><p>&#8220;There will be a net fiscal loss under independence, looking into the future.&#8221;</p><p>Citigroup has stated:</p><p>&#8220;with the recent drop in oil revenues, Scotland's fiscal deficit is now significantly above UK levels.&#8221;</p><p>The Pensions Policy Institute has said that a future Scottish Government would need to raise tax, cut spending or accept higher borrowing.</p><p>Johann Lamont was right to say that there is an arithmetic and credibility gap: first, between the Scottish Government&#8217;s claims about the public finances in an independent Scotland and most of the other independent assessments, and secondly, between the promises that are made that would entail more spending and the money that is to be raised to pay for them. There are no credible costings for a radical expansion of welfare benefits or childcare, and&#8212;allegedly&#8212;no work has been done at all on calculating the expense of setting up the institutions of a new country.</p><p>At the same time, the Government has pledged that there will be no rises in personal taxation and that there will be cuts in corporation tax. On the latter policy, the Scottish Government&#8217;s own much-admired Professor Stiglitz has said:</p><p>&#8220;Some of you have been told that lowering tax rates on corporations will lead to more investment. The fact is that&#8217;s not true. It is just a gift to the corporations increasing inequality in our society.&#8221;</p><p>I would prefer to hear a lecture on redistribution from Joseph Stiglitz, rather than the one by Dave Thompson that we heard earlier.</p><p>Today, Labour has sought to debate the risks to our public services that we believe exist because of the Government&#8217;s failure to present a case for independence that adds up. The experts are saying that our fiscal position will be worse because of independence and that taxes will have to go up or services will need to be cut.</p><p>We know that there will be set-up costs associated with independence and that there are costs associated with the policy promises that the Scottish Government is still making, and yet we are told that everything will be better, that more money will be spent and that we will pay for it by cutting taxes for big business.</p><p>It is difficult to believe what the SNP is saying. Since its line appears to be, &#8220;Say anything&#8221;, it is easy to deduce that SNP members do not believe it themselves. If we take them at their word, the only commonsense conclusion is that the costs will have to be paid elsewhere: in schools, hospitals or other public services.</p><p>Following the most recent downgrading of oil revenue estimates, the independent experts are predicting a bigger fiscal gap in the first year of independence. I have heard nothing this afternoon that explains why all those independent experts are maliciously making those estimates. It is extraordinary.</p><p>There are many points to be debated with regard to the pros and cons of independence, and there are a variety of interesting legal arguments to pore over. There are those, such as Joan McAlpine, who will be fascinated and excited by the business of drafting a constitution, and those who are already with the Scottish Government who passionately believe that Scotland should be free, no matter what and no matter what the costs are. However, there are many more who are looking for a real debate about what independence would mean for them, their families, their jobs, their local hospital and the school that their child attends.</p><p>As Parliament approaches its summer recess, Labour will continue to seek to convince others of our view that Scotland is better off in the UK, working with others and pooling and sharing our resources. We will put the positive case for partnership and argue that we can have the best of both worlds. We will do so for simple reasons that can be understood even by those who disagree with us.</p><p>We do not need to spend time worrying about how to put a currency union back together when we have one at present, or about how to get back into the EU when we have the most preferential terms of membership already. We do not need to worry about asking the Bank of England to be our lender of last resort when taxpayers throughout the UK have already stood behind the Scottish banks.</p><p>We do not need to agonise over how to create a new social union when we can already stand with other progressive people in London, Belfast and Cardiff and argue for the real political changes that we want to see in Scotland and in Britain. As Iain Gray spelled out, we do not need to put at risk our public services on a prospectus that simply does not add up.</p><p>We can do something better than that. We can decide for ourselves to work together with others rather than to break free of them. We can self-determine to be willing partners in a union. If that union has faults, we have helped to make them, but if it can be made better, we can resolve to do that.</p><p>It is for those reasons that Scottish Labour is urging Scotland to vote no in September.

I would once again like to thank Dennis Robertson for bringing this important issue to the attention of the Scottish Parliament, and I commend his efforts in raising awareness of the damaging consequences of the misuse of our blue badge scheme. I reiterate that I support his member&#8217;s bill and I acknowledge that it is likely to deliver a reduction in disabled parking badge fraud. I am hopeful that that will lead to an increase in the number of parking spaces that are available to genuinely disabled people, and that that will, as a consequence, improve the quality of life of those who suffer mobility issues.</p><p>Local authorities face a significant problem in distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent badge holders. I have learned through the evidence that the Local Government and Regeneration Committee gathered through the progress of the bill that nearly 80 per cent of blue badge holders have directly experienced abuse of the system. The bill has the potential to reduce substantially the inconvenience that that causes disabled drivers.</p><p>My support for the bill arises from the conviction that those who are entitled to a blue badge should be able to access disabled parking bays when they need to. The availability of accessible spaces should never be compromised by the self-interest of those who use blue badges for convenience alone.</p><p>I believe strongly that the Scottish Government should seek to work with key stakeholders, including local authorities, to ensure that the bill is implemented consistently across the country and does not cause unnecessary confusion among genuine badge holders. I continue to believe that badge holders should be provided with comprehensive and accessible information on how their badges can be used. That would provide reassurance that disabled people who inadvertently misuse their badges are not penalised by the provisions of the bill.</p><p>I acknowledge Inclusion Scotland&#8217;s concerns that a disabled person or a carer may be criminalised when they inadvertently use a badge that has been cancelled&#8212;for example, if it has been reported lost, and has subsequently been found before the replacement has been issued. I am therefore grateful for recent assurances that no action will be taken against individuals in those circumstances. I am confident that that commonsense approach will be maintained after the bill&#8217;s implementation, and I anticipate that genuine badge holders will benefit from the policy.</p><p>Local authorities should be fully resourced to implement the bill&#8217;s provisions, including both the enforcement and review elements of the blue badge application process. I would be concerned if local authorities were tasked with implementing the new assessment and enforcement provisions without the appropriate level of funding to allow council officers to carry out their duties effectively.</p><p>Notwithstanding that concern, I am delighted to confirm my support for the bill, and I look forward to my disabled constituents receiving the benefit of an increased number of accessible parking spaces across their city.

I, too, thank David Stewart for all his hard work in making these important proposals in the Parliament. Huge thanks are also due to the convener and members of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, of which I am a member.</p><p>In response to the minister, Derek Mackay, I am pleased to note that the Scottish Government continues to broadly support the bill and I welcome his amendments. I agree that the majority of them were procedural and served to strengthen our shared aims.</p><p>Ultimately, the bill will provide the power for local authorities to carry out modifications on defective or dangerous buildings and pass the cost on to the owner of such a building. Sarah Boyack rightly raised the concern that local authorities are paying for repairs to derelict properties in times of budget constraints. That is unfair and unsustainable. The bill will help to address that issue and provide a commonsense answer to the question of improving our town and city centres.</p><p>I welcome the reintroduction of charging orders as a means of ensuring that the local authority is able to recover its expenses before the building changes ownership. To clarify, in cases in which owners fail to respond to the local authority&#8217;s notice that their residence is unsafe and must be altered&#8212;Sarah Boyack mentioned an owner in Antigua and I think my colleague on the committee Kevin Stewart mentioned one in Gibraltar&#8212;the bill will facilitate repayment for authorities that undertake the modifications.</p><p>David Stewart&#8217;s member&#8217;s bill amends the Building (Scotland) Act 2003 in order to introduce a more efficient and flexible cost-recovery process for local authorities. It grants local authorities the power to make charging orders that will attach to the properties in question and recover some of the outstanding debt when the property is eventually sold.</p><p>It creates flexibility in allowing property owners to negotiate with the local authority and possibly pay a reduced amount, which improves debt recovery rates, while also allowing for a settlement that is acceptable to both parties.</p><p>I believe that the bill will significantly increase rates of recovery of expenses from building owners, given that the current recovery rate is low, at only 50 per cent. By expanding cost-recovery mechanisms, the bill encourages local authorities to fix defective buildings preventively before the likely costs would increase.</p><p>Currently, there is a large disparity in how local authorities are issuing notices; certain councils issue a high number of notices each year while others issue very few or none. In addition, notices are issued per owner, not per building, so the number of notices issued per year does not necessarily account for the true number of buildings falling under the bill&#8217;s jurisdiction. The bill will standardise the process.</p><p>The bill creates a provision for individuals to make appeals against incorrect charging orders, thereby establishing a mechanism of accountability for local authorities carrying out the repairs. I am reassured to note that the right to appeal against a charging order has remained an important part of the bill. I believe that its incorporation will serve to strengthen the process of recovering expenses from the building owners.</p><p>I have considered the contributions of most of the members who have spoken this morning&#8212;apologies to those I did not mention. I thank members for sharing their fine examples of how the bill will ultimately benefit our communities. I am confident that there exists a broad level of consensus on the aims of the bill. I believe that local authorities will find a way to exercise the new powers in a manner that reflects local priorities and improves the safety and aesthetics of our communities.

For example, we share a common commitment to increasing the availability of affordable housing, which Colin Keir mentioned, particularly around our largest cities. The plan will allow that aspiration to be realised, by designating the geographical zones that each local authority should allocate for future building projects. That will fight against the continuing price rises in urban and city centre areas and will allow families on lower incomes to live nearer the places where they work.</p><p>The plans also allow key public bodies to work together at the earliest stages of town planning. Our transport, waste, water and energy infrastructure will also be covered by the strategic plans, as will the promotion of green belts and networks.</p><p>We must ensure that our local community groups are consulted alongside local and national public bodies at the early stage of the planning process.

I am deeply concerned by the 20 per cent fall in turnout at local government elections since 1999. I fear that that trend could continue if we do not take action to address the problems that we face.</p><p>It is well documented that a low turnout such as we have experienced in recent years could lead to a democratic deficit in local government. The result would be an absence of democratic accountability and a weak mandate for local councillors to assume any control over the decision-making process.</p><p>The only way around the depressing lack of engagement with local government is to hand over real power and influence to authorities across the country. If people understand that their local council has the ability and&#8212;crucially&#8212;the resources to bring about change in their community, they will understand the value of their vote.</p><p>What is needed is a radical approach that provides for local government in Scotland and affords opportunities for community development and the empowerment of ordinary people in the decision-making process. Local government should be outward looking and should seek to engage communities at every stage of its processes.</p><p>I firmly believe that a system that establishes a clearer distinction between the roles of central and local government in determining council budgets should be put in place. That would allow local authorities a fairer budget settlement and make far clearer to ordinary electors the role of local government. Only when people know who and what they are voting for and why they are voting can they communicate the value of local government elections and their impact on communities.</p><p>Another issue that requires urgent attention is the participation of women as candidate councillors. Fewer than one in four councillors are women; that is lower than the rate for women among MSPs and MPs. It is for all political parties and local government to reverse the trend. We must have a system of local government that truly reflects the diversity of the people whom it claims to represent.</p><p>In local government, we have seen a decline in voter turnout and participation, a growing gender gap in elections and an unassessed inequality in relation to voting by younger and economically disadvantaged citizens, which my colleague Sarah Boyack mentioned. We must work together to address each of those points in order to improve participation in elections and the administration of local government.</p><p>We should increase voter turnout by enfranchising 16 and 17-year-olds and providing better public access and information.

It is simply undeniable that the loss of 140,000 college places since 2007 is undermining efforts to upskill our future business leaders. Scotland needs to provide the training and skills that are essential to meet the economy&#8217;s long-term needs, and we cannot achieve that if we cut the funding to the courses that are most accessible to women.</p><p>If women were responsible for a higher proportion of the business start-ups in Scotland, the potential for economic growth would be staggering. According to research from Women&#8217;s Enterprise Scotland, only 21 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s 343,000 small to medium-sized enterprises are run by women, and it is thought that that gender imbalance could be costing our nation up to &#163;13 billion every year.</p><p>A reversal of that trend would be transformational both for our economy and for gender equality in Scottish business, and it would significantly improve the lives of thousands of families across Scotland. In order to achieve that, however, women must have the opportunity to learn new skills and build their capacity, capabilities and confidence in flexible and welcoming environments.</p><p>The Scottish Government is making that task harder by closing off routes to learning for thousands of potential entrepreneurs, and the effect of that decision is reflected by the size of the gender gap in Scottish business start-up rates.</p><p>Last week, I used an oral question to ask the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism what specific measures the Scottish Government has taken to increase that gender gap. In response, the minister did not detail one specific measure that the Government has taken to encourage women to start their own businesses. As a consequence, I remain deeply concerned that we could be doing much more to capitalise on the entrepreneurial potential of Scotland&#8217;s women.</p><p>We should not make the mistake of presuming that Scotland&#8217;s women are less keen, less able or less enthusiastic about becoming self-employed. Recently, Women&#8217;s Enterprise Scotland published a report on the state of women-led businesses in Scotland, which highlighted that 87 per cent of women entrepreneurs want to grow and expand their businesses, and the report also identified specific areas where women need support to help them to achieve their aims.</p><p>Occupational segregation has been identified as a key roadblock to encouraging women as business leaders, and the report made specific recommendations to address that through changes such as the promotion of flexible working arrangements. In addition to that, I believe that we can best tackle gender segregation at its roots in the early years of education.</p><p>We need to challenge the enforcement of gender roles on young people in schools and other places of learning, and we should encourage women and men towards employment in non-traditional occupations. It is only through challenging the expectations that we have of men and women in our society&#8212;and by providing equality of opportunity&#8212;that women will be able to take their rightful place at the top table of Scottish business.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Improving Entrepreneurship among Women and Young People"}, {"date": "2014-06-04", "body": "<p></p><p>1.

That imbalance needs to be addressed fully before significant progress can be made on reversing the long-term decline of some of our town centres and the significant levels of deprivation that too many people in Scotland face.</p><p>The allocation of funding is another issue that continues to affect the success of local regeneration efforts. Evidence presented to the committee suggested that funding for regeneration projects is patchy and that communities and local stakeholders are unsure about how to apply for the resources that they need. The application process to secure funding should be well advertised, transparent and consistent. I also believe that a focus on longer-term funding models would benefit disadvantaged areas the most. That would enable local projects to rely on a steady stream of support, which could be invested in the local community based on its changing needs and circumstances.</p><p>It is undeniable that the significant cuts in local authority funding are having a profound effect on regeneration efforts right across Scotland. Local government is tasked with maintaining its existing levels of service provision on a reduced budget while introducing new commitments in a number of areas. That is simply unsustainable, and it is inevitable that regeneration projects will suffer as a consequence. Local government is a key partner in the delivery of regeneration to local communities, and it is clear that much more could be achieved for local people if existing council services received adequate levels of support.</p><p>In my role as a member of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, I have found the process of gathering evidence to be helpful in determining where our efforts should be focused. It has become clear that we need to strengthen the role of communities in the design and delivery of services and learn from the experiences of those who have worked with public bodies to bring regeneration projects to their local area. Funding should be more readily available for groups that understand the nature of their communities and the means by which local issues can be addressed. I am confident that that approach will result in successful regeneration projects that have the ability to reverse long-term decline and to tackle trends of deprivation right across the country.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, {"date": "2014-05-20", "body": "<p>As a member of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, I have had the opportunity to consider in some detail the proposal contained in the bill and its likely effects. I thank Dennis Robertson MSP for bringing an important issue to the attention of the Scottish Parliament, and I commend his efforts in raising awareness of the very real consequences of blue badge misuse in towns and cities across Scotland.</p><p>I fully support the bill&#8217;s broad aims. I acknowledge that it can often be challenging for disabled people to find accessible parking spaces and that blue badges go some way towards addressing the difficulties that badge holders experience in reaching their destination safely. I was initially surprised to learn that more than half of all blue badge holders believe that misuse of badges is a major problem. Despite realising that disabled parking badges were too often open to misuse, I had not appreciated the scale of the problem that local authorities face in distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent badge holders.</p><p>I feel strongly that the Scottish Government should seek to work with key stakeholders to ensure that all blue badge holders are properly educated on the use of the badge. I appreciate the minister&#8217;s comments about the top 10 tips that people will easily understand, which sounds like an excellent idea. That would provide reassurance that disabled people who inadvertently misuse their badge will not be penalised under the bill&#8217;s provisions.</p><p>I recognise concerns raised by the Law Society of Scotland that the introduction of new criminal offences&#8212;of driving a motor vehicle while displaying a cancelled badge and of wrongful use of a blue badge&#8212;are simply duplications of the existing common-law offence of fraud. However, I believe that the incorporation of those offences in statutory form will raise awareness of the seriousness of blue badge misuse and will send a clear message that those who deprive genuinely disabled people of accessible parking spaces will be punished.</p><p>However, I share the concern that the bill does not contain a right of appeal to an impartial body after a blue badge application has been reviewed and rejected by a local authority. I believe that there should be an external appeals process&#8212;one that is resourced&#8212;that reviews the rejection of applications by local authorities, and that that external process should have the power to overturn the original decision if there is evidence to justify an appeal. I also believe that, as Cameron Buchanan said in his closing speech, local authorities should be fully resourced to implement the provisions of the bill, including in relation to enforcement and the review elements of the of the blue badge application process.</p><p>Notwithstanding those observations, I am delighted to confirm my support for the aims of the proposed legislation. and I look forward to considering the issues in greater detail with my constituents as the bill progresses.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/25108.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "image_width": 99, "person_id": "25108", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Anne McTaggart", "member_id": "80492", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Glasgow"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Humza", "last_name": "Yousaf", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>It is a privilege for me to close this debate on behalf of the Scottish Government and as a proud Glaswegian. I thank James Dornan for securing this precious parliamentary time and I fully endorse the motion in his name.</p><p>I join other members in the chamber in complimenting Glasgow the Caring City on the excellent work that it does in Glasgow and overseas, as well as congratulating it on its 15th birthday. I also add my compliments to the Rev Neil Galbraith, whom I hold in high regard. It is a testament to him that everyone in this chamber, across the political parties, speaks highly of him. I also know him as an individual. He is one of those forces of nature to whom&#8212;sometimes even somewhat annoyingly&#8212;it is difficult to say no.</p><p>Although I fear that Linda Fabiani might have got herself into trouble with her priest or her minister, there have been some excellent speeches today reflecting on the facets and strands of work&#8212;too many to mention&#8212;that have been done by Glasgow the Caring City.</p><p>As the discussion was going on in the chamber, I reflected on my two favourite parts of the Commonwealth games opening ceremony. We all, universally, enjoyed the UNICEF moment, which showed off Glasgow as the caring city and Scotland as the caring nation and made that opening ceremony the first ever to raise money for orphans across the world.</p><p>My other favourite moment was when the African singer Pumeza sang &#8220;Freedom Come-All-Ye&#8221;. Leaving aside the issue of what freedom might mean in a traditional sense, what I liked about that was that it encompasses everybody in its come-all-ye stance and includes freedom from poverty, freedom from deprivation, freedom from social stigma and freedom from having one&#8217;s life opportunities hindered. It means freedom not only for Scottish children and Glaswegians but for those across the world. If ever there was a charity that summed up that approach, it would be Glasgow the Caring City, because of the work that it does domestically in Scotland as well as overseas&#8212;there are few organisations that manage to do both as successfully as Glasgow the Caring City does.</p><p>Many of the charity&#8217;s projects have been mentioned. I want to mention again its training programme, which provides training opportunities to young adults and empowers people to make the most of the skills that they have. It is a great example of its work, as is the give a kid a goal campaign, which helps our schoolchildren to gain a better understanding of their place in the world and how they can make a difference in tackling the challenges that are faced by our planet.</p><p>The Scottish Government fully endorses that ambition to help our young people to become fully global citizens. It is a key part of our curriculum for excellence. Last year, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and I jointly announced funding for six development education centres to work with our young people in Scotland in accordance with the ethos of the give a kid a goal campaign in order to empower them and give them a knowledge of the world that we live in, so that they can gain an appreciation of the difference that they can make.</p><p>That is hugely important. In a world in which, as Linda Fabiani said, people are cynical about giving money overseas&#8212;asking, &#8220;Why do we do it?&#8221; and saying, &#8220;Charity begins at home&#8221;&#8212;and in this day and age, when finances are tough and we are in difficult economic times, we have a real obligation to ensure that our children are educated to understand the responsibilities that they have as individuals and global citizens.</p><p>When it comes to partnership working, which the Scottish Government is keen on, a great example was provided by Glasgow the Caring City&#8217;s superb contribution to the celebration city festival during the Commonwealth games. The phrase &#8220;people make Glasgow&#8221; was one of the slogans of the games, and Glasgow the Caring City helped to demonstrate that through the work that it did, working with 40 other partners, to showcase the very best of Glasgow hospitality through a superb cultural programme of activities that were attended by more than 10,000 people.</p><p>The work that it is doing domestically is on the record, and that brings me to the overseas work that Glasgow the Caring City has been involved in over the past 15 years, much of which has been mentioned.</p><p>Hanzala Malik mentioned the genesis of that work at the time of the Balkans conflict. The motion also rightly recognises the support that Glasgow the Caring City has been giving to Himbaza school in Burundi. That is just a flavour of the work that it is doing. It is also working in South Sudan, Malawi and Uganda and throughout the developing world.</p><p>I was interested to hear about James Dornan&#8217;s trip to Uganda and South Sudan. I read some of the articles that he wrote on his return. I am pleased that he got to see the football game, but I am also pleased that he was not playing&#8212;otherwise, the poor Ugandans might have needed to be sent some shin pads as well.</p><p>Through its international development policy, the Scottish Government aims for Scotland to be seen not only as a good global citizen but as a global leader, in which context I acknowledge the work that Scottish charities such as Glasgow the Caring City do. However, as every member who has spoken has said, that work is underpinned by the volunteer network that those charities have. People have a real affiliation not just through Cathcart old parish church, which I have had the pleasure of visiting, but more widely across the city and the country. We politicians have the easy job of putting the funding together and making the resources available where and when we can; those who work on the ground through charities such as Glasgow the Caring City actually get the work done, and I commend them for that.</p><p>The Government is determined to play its part in helping to make that happen through our international development work. We have made a commitment, in the event of a yes vote, not only to meet the target of spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income on overseas development assistance but to enshrine it in legislation. However, whatever the result of the referendum, we are committed to helping those in the poorest parts of the world. That means helping women and girls into education, helping those who do not have access to energy or clean water and addressing the simplest and most basic challenges that nobody in the 21st century should have to suffer.</p><p>I add to what Hanzala Malik said by placing on record the Scottish Government&#8217;s appreciation of all the non-governmental organisations throughout the country, which do a phenomenal job. He mentioned the Ucare Foundation and Islamic Relief. This morning, I had the pleasure of meeting the new director of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund. I also acknowledge the work that is done by all the members of the Network of International Development Organisations in Scotland, the Scotland Malawi Partnership and many others.</p><p>I commend the motion. Over the past 15 years, Glasgow the Caring City has done not only Glasgow but Scotland proud. As is customary in discussing such a motion, I look forward to James Dornan providing the 15th birthday cake. I wish the organisation every success for more than another 15 years. I commend the work that the Rev Neil Galbraith and his team are doing, and I look forward to working closely with them in the future.</p><p>13:02 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:30 On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow the Caring City"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>Will the member give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Department for International Development"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>I do not take away anything from the good work that the UK Government has done; indeed, I have always been fair in giving it credit where credit is due.

The UK is far behind in that respect.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Department for International Development"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>The motion and the opening speech by Margaret McCulloch are nothing but an exercise in scaremongering, fear baiting and the politics of cynicism all rolled into one. However, the debate gives me, if nothing else, the opportunity to offer my assurances and reassurances once again on commitments that the Scottish Government has given in relation to the UK Government Department for International Development.</p><p>From what I have previously said in Parliament and from what I have said everywhere that I have spoken on the public record, people will be able to see that I have given fair credit to DFID for the good work that it does. I have also met the staff who work in Abercrombie house on a number of occasions at various events. There is absolutely no question in my mind as to their commitment to the cause of international development.</p><p>My concern has always been that much of the good work that DFID has done, even when it has not met the 0.7 per cent target, has been undermined by the UK Government&#8217;s other policies in foreign affairs and trade&#8212;some of which have been mentioned&#8212;whether it has been arms and defence sales to Saddam Hussein, Robert Mugabe, General Suharto and the Argentinian military junta, to name just a few, or foreign policies such as the illegal invasion of Iraq, which has been mentioned by members.</p><p>We have offered reassurances on jobs to DFID. I offered those reassurances when I was questioned by the Westminster International Development Select Committee during its inquiry on the future of development in the event of independence. I said then and I reiterate now that we would work with the UK Government to preserve continuity of employment of all civil service jobs in Scotland. We have said that before in terms of defence and jobs in other reserved functions, and we say it again in relation to the 604 jobs in DFID in East Kilbride. Those people make a massive contribution; I do not doubt that for a second. Their expertise is a great asset to a future Scottish international development function and even an external affairs function. They would be a fantastic asset.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch said that DFID in East Kilbride would not be the same size. She used Ireland as an example. The problem is that if we are to compare like with like, we must compare countries that have the same ambition as Scotland has for its international development function. We have said clearly in our white paper&#8212;which the member has on her desk, if she wishes to open it&#8212;that we have committed to spending at least the 0.7 per cent target and that we aspire to go beyond that target.</p><p>On countries that have a population the size of Scotland&#8217;s, Denmark, for example, has a population of 5.59&#160;million and meets the 0.7 per cent target. In fact, it exceeds that target. Denmark has 846 international development and external affairs staff. Sweden has a population of 9.52&#160;million&#8212;which is, of course, bigger than Scotland&#8217;s, but is still under the 10&#160;million population bracket&#8212;and has 735 staff because it meets that 0.7 per cent target. When we look at countries that have the ambition that Scotland has and the number of such jobs that they have, we see that we could maintain those jobs. Not only would we be able to maintain and continue the employment of those people, but other opportunities would be available, including an external affairs function.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Department for International Development"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>I will not go into set-up costs. I have here, of course, the figure that the UK Government came up with when it came up with set-up costs, which is 12 times the cost that was estimated by Professor Patrick Dunleavy. Of course, his figure of between &#163;150&#160;million and &#163;200&#160;million for set-up costs was well rehearsed. Also, it was mentioned that those costs would be recouped through efficiency savings.</p><p>The point about uncertainty is what I want to move on to. Although we have said that we will preserve continuity of employment and have cemented that by saying that we have a policy&#8212;as members are aware&#8212;of having no compulsory redundancies, no such commitment is forthcoming from the UK Government. That is where the uncertainty about the DFID jobs lies. In fact, even members in the Opposition parties have not committed to having no compulsory redundancies. Those in the Labour Opposition have not committed to no compulsory redundancies. Ed Balls has not committed to having no compulsory redundancies. If he has, please would members intervene and tell me otherwise? I did not think that he had.</p><p>When it comes to the threat to DFID jobs, that threat comes from the UK Government. Here are some of the things that Margaret McCulloch&#8217;s good friend, Michael McCann MP, has said.</p><p>He has said:</p><p>&#8220;I have also made it clear that compulsory redundancies should be avoided at all costs&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>he does not realise that his party has not quite made a commitment to that&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;and have asked the Minister to keep me updated with any developments.</p><p>It seems to me that the Government isn&#8217;t doing all it can to protect British jobs.&#8221;</p><p>Margaret McCulloch&#8217;s very good friend Michael McCann has also said:</p><p>&#8220;Today my worst fears have come to pass, despite the department&#8217;s previous denials. Staff&#8221;</p><p>at DFID</p><p>&#8220;were called to a meeting and told in excess of 140 jobs will go ... But more than that&#8221;</p><p>Andrew Mitchell</p><p>&#8220;owes it to the staff to reverse this crazy decision.&#8221;</p><p>If Margaret McCulloch does not believe me, perhaps she will believe Michael McCann, and if she does not believe her very good friend Michael McCann MP, perhaps she will look at DFID&#8217;s accounts, as other members have. The International Development Select Committee examined and scrutinised those accounts, which show clearly&#8212;in the graph that I am holding up&#8212;that the number of staff will reduce in 2014-15. The threat to jobs comes not from a yes vote but from the status quo.</p><p>The Scottish Government has an ambitious vision of the role that Scotland could play as a good global citizen. We have committed to the 0.7 per cent target that the UK has finally met&#8212;I have been fair in commending the UK Government on eventually getting there. It took a Conservative Government to get us there; in her motion, Margaret McCulloch says that the UK Government has &#8220;at last&#8221; reached the target.</p><p>It is important to realise that the 43 years for which the target was missed represent &#163;87.5&#160;billion of missing aid. That is not something to be proud of. In the 1970s, Sweden was the first country to reach the target, in 1974. In 1975, the Netherlands met it. In 1976, it was Norway and in 1978, it was Denmark. All four of those countries have consistently met the target. What do they have in common? They are of course small independent European nations.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm said that there is no way that Scotland could have the same impact as the UK; he almost questioned the audacity of Scotland even to think that it could have the same impact as the rest of the UK. My point is simple&#8212;we should look at contributions to development according to the CDI, which is the index that his colleague Margaret McCulloch mentioned. On that index, the UK is in a commendable eighth position, but the other nine of the first 10 countries on the index are small independent nations. That index does not rank countries by their size in monetary terms; it ranks them by their impact&#8212;their contribution&#8212;and what they have achieved on the world stage in tackling poverty.</p><p>Our vision for international development goes above and beyond what some members have suggested a small country should seek to do. We want to legislate for the 0.7 per cent and we want to do aid better. We will of course work with the UK Government to do that, and with any Government that wishes to achieve that.</p><p>I am disappointed that a members&#8217; business debate has been used for such a distasteful motion, which is intended to scare hard-working civil servants across the country. I give the absolute assurance again that, in the case of a vote for independence, we will preserve continuity of employment for not just DFID staff but hard-working civil servants across the country.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:58.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Department for International Development"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>It is customary to thank the member who has brought the debate to the chamber and, of course, I do that. I also thank him for securing cross-party support for the motion. However, I can say on behalf of the Government and possibly on behalf of the chamber that this is a debate that we would rather not be having.</p><p>Across the chamber, the tone of what has been a very difficult and quite rightly emotional debate has been exemplary; I think that we have done well in that regard. It has often been said that conflict is in our nature. In the pages of history, humanity has never had a time without some sort of conflict. However, I believe that empathy is also very much a part of our human nature. Even the hardest and coldest hearts cannot fail to be moved by the scenes of devastation and destruction that we have seen unfolding in the Gaza strip.</p><p>Members across the chamber have mentioned the statistics&#8212;of course, there is a story behind every single one. Almost 2,000 Gazans have been killed and the UN suspects that the vast majority of them have been civilian deaths; 458 children have been killed; 1.5 million people have no, or very limited access to water; 200,000 people in the Gaza strip are in need of emergency food aid; over 65,000 people have been made homeless; the health system is on the verge of complete and utter collapse, with 24 health facilities either damaged or facing acute shortages of medicine.</p><p>The Scottish Government cannot and will not stand idly by while this takes place. We must be proactive and unequivocal in the messages that we deliver. Of course we condemn all violence. Every single member who has stood up has condemned all the violence and the Scottish Government joins them in that. Make no mistake about it: rockets that are fired into Israel are wrong. They are designed to injure and to kill indiscriminately. This Government says that they must stop, and must stop now. Everybody agrees, of course, that Israel has a right to live in security and safety. However, it must be widely recognised and stated on the record that the Israeli Government&#8217;s response has been utterly and completely disproportionate and it must be condemned in the strongest possible manner for that. Those who fail to condemn it&#8212;there are some on these islands who have failed to condemn it&#8212;are doing themselves, but also humanity, an injustice. A provocation&#8212;and yes, there is provocation&#8212;does not relieve one of accountability for how one chooses to respond.</p><p>We all believe that an immediate and long-term ceasefire is needed. We have seen a ceasefire extend beyond the 72-hour period and we all hope that it extends into a long-term ceasefire. We need those who are firing rockets into Israel to put down their weapons immediately and the Israeli Government to cease its fire, but we must also consider the inhumanity of the situation and ensure that a ceasefire, though it is important in terms of dropping and stopping the weapon fire, means that the blockade is lifted. Gaza is, as some have said, an open-air prison. Those are not my words but the words of the Prime Minister, David Cameron, in 2010. It is an open-air prison and it is collective punishment.</p><p>Although powers over foreign affairs are by and large reserved to the UK Government, the Scottish Government has been decisive in its action. I will try to respond to some of the questions that members asked in the debate. We have donated &#163;500,000 to the UNRWA flash appeal for shelter and medicine. It is important that we did that. Although we do not have a ring-fenced budget for emergency aid, we cannot stand idly by. I urge people to continue to donate. The DEC has launched an appeal and people can find more information on how to donate on its website.</p><p>One of the first offers that we made was of medical assistance and opening up our hospitals for medical treatment. Some members mentioned that they have been contacted about a delay. The Scottish Government had a teleconference last week with the director of Medical Aid for Palestinians in Gaza. We told him about the specialisms that we have in Scotland, but we also heard about the priorities of cases in Gaza. The next step is for the consultants on the ground in Gaza to give us a list of their priority cases that they need to be treated. However, make no mistake about it&#8212;the Scottish Government faces exactly the same obstacles as anybody else. There is an illegal and inhumane blockade of Gaza and we are experiencing difficulty in bringing people to Scotland.</p><p>That said, I have received a letter from the Prime Minister in response to the First Minister&#8217;s letter on the situation and, at the end of his letter, the Prime Minister says that the UK intends also to offer its hospitals, as we called on it to do, to treat the injured of Gaza. He was aware of the offer from Scottish hospitals. I therefore hope that, logistically, we will have some assistance from the UK Government. I assure all members in the chamber that we are doing our utmost to treat those injured in Gaza, where and when we can do so.</p><p>The UK Government must bring more urgency to its actions. The First Minister called for that in his letter to the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, the UK has been painfully silent and too stagnant in its actions. I spoke to Baroness Warsi on the night when she chose to leave the Government, which would have been a painfully difficult decision for her. I commended her on her actions but agreed with her entirely that the UK Government&#8217;s position on Gaza has been painfully silent and indefensible. If it cannot be stronger on the issue, then at the very least we urge that the UK and all of us should not be complicit in any of the atrocities that are taking place in the Gaza strip. That is why we called for an immediate arms embargo.</p><p>The UN has said that there is a strong possibility that international law has been violated. Ban Ki-moon, after the shelling of the UN shelter in Rafah, said that that was a moral outrage and a criminal act. There must be an embargo. Cara Hilton was right to raise the point about the plant in Fife. Make no mistake about it: whether that company is Scottish, English, Northern Irish or Welsh, we believe that there should be a complete arms embargo, and it is disgraceful that profit is being put above compassion.</p><p>Sandra White, Alison Johnstone and other members asked us to look at the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. I know that that campaign has gone to the Deputy First Minister, who is looking at it and is exploring what can be done in relation to illegal settlements. It should be put very much on the record that the UK Government&#8217;s guidance does not encourage or support trade with illegal settlements.</p><p>I will address a point that Ken Macintosh and others made. If the Jewish community in Glasgow feels that it is perhaps the victim of anti-Semitism because of the rising tensions in the middle east, I assure it that the Scottish Government will stand with it. Any anti-Semitism is to be absolutely abhorred. I spoke to the Lord Advocate about the issue this morning and I give the assurance that I will speak to him again, so that we continue to monitor the situation.</p><p>I will end with a story. Sometimes, we get caught up in statistics and forget that there is a story behind every statistic. This is not about being pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian; at its base, it is about being pro-humanitarian. I urge everybody to read the story, if they can, of a mother by the name of Wejdan Shammalla who moved back to Khan Yunis in the Gaza strip. We have to hear her story to believe it. She has three children and she asks all of us to think of our own children, our nieces and nephews or our grandchildren and imagine that we have three of them. Every night before she goes to sleep, she must ask herself whether all three children should sleep in her bed with her and her husband so that, if a rocket hits the house, they will all die together as a family, or whether she should split the children&#8212;as she does some nights; would we do that in her situation?&#8212;and have two with her and one with her husband so that, if a missile hits, perhaps some of them will survive. If someone has to split up their children, how do they choose which children to put in which room? No parent and no individual should have to make such a choice.</p><p>The Scottish Government calls for the immediate lifting of the blockade. The solution should be political, not military. Settlements are illegal and should be removed. We support the two-state solution. Israel has of course a right to safety and security, but at the heart of the injustice over the decades has been the utter denial of a viable Palestinian state.</p><p>Above and beyond the politics is the humanitarian. The Scottish Government stands and unites with every member across the chamber to say that children are not terrorists, whether they are playing on a beach, feeding pigeons or sleeping in a UN shelter. Innocent civilians must never be targeted. That is why we call for an immediate UN investigation into the killing of civilians, so that those who have possibly been violating international law feel the full force of international justice.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;18:28.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>The Scottish Government condemns in the strongest possible terms the escalating cycle of violence, be it rocket attacks or air strikes in Gaza and Israel, and the disproportionate impact in particular on civilians in Gaza, who the United Nations estimates make up approximately 75 per cent of the Palestinian dead. We are appalled that the death toll now stands at more than 1,800, including nearly 400 children. We are pleased to note the ceasefire that was announced last night and the withdrawal of Israeli troops that was reported this morning, and we hope that meaningful peace talks, which we hope will lead to a lasting ceasefire, will start as soon as possible.</p><p>It was announced on 30 July that the Scottish Government is providing &#163;500,000 in humanitarian aid, in addition to the United Kingdom contribution, to help people affected by the crisis in Gaza. The Scottish Government has also offered to treat here in Scottish hospitals casualties who require specialist care as a result of the conflict.</p><p>We call for an immediate lifting of the blockade in Gaza, which we believe to be tantamount to collective punishment.</p><p>Since the conflict started, the Scottish Government has written to the Prime Minister, on 25 July, the Home Secretary, on 18 July, and the Foreign Secretary, on 9 July, to ask the UK to take concrete action to make meaningful progress towards a lasting peace and to ask that it plays its part in international refugee settlement programmes, in which the Scottish Government is happy to play its part. The Scottish Government has demonstrated that we cannot, should not and must not stand idly by while innocent civilians are being killed.</p><p>I am today, on behalf of the Scottish Government, calling for an immediate arms embargo on Israel. The United Nations has said that there is a strong possibility that international law has been violated and the UN secretary general has described the recent shelling of a school in Rafah as &#8220;a criminal act.&#8221; It is imperative that we decipher whether or not UK arms have been used in any violation of international law. Until that has been confirmed, the UK must implement a complete arms embargo on Israel.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>Yesterday, we spoke to the director of Medical Aid for Palestinians, which is an organisation working in Gaza that I know the member is aware of. We spoke to its director in Gaza, who is putting together a list of those who are in priority need of specialist care. That discussion is going on with the non-governmental organisation on the ground. The member will appreciate that we have to consult a number of Governments: the Israeli Government; the Egyptian Government in terms of the Rafah crossing; the Palestinian Authority; and, indeed, the UK Government, which will issue the visas should we agree to offer people specialist care. I have to say that, in previous cases when we have wanted to bring people here for specialist care, the UK Government has not impeded that and has helped. I am sure that, because of the priority and the immediacy of the need in this case, it will also be willing to assist on this occasion.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>We have said&#8212;be it the First Minister or me directly on behalf of the Scottish Government&#8212;that we call for an immediate UN investigation into all civilian deaths.

Israel has a right to safety and security, and of course nobody would tolerate rockets being fired indiscriminately&#8212;let us not beat around the bush: the rockets are designed and are fired indiscriminately to kill. However, we cannot ignore the fact that, as the member said, 1,800 have been killed, the majority of whom were civilians. Children who are playing on a beach, feeding pigeons in the street or sleeping in a United Nations shelter are not terrorists. They have committed no crime. Therefore, of course we back UN calls for an international investigation and Scotland would support that.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>I agree entirely. Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner for human rights, has said that there is a strong possibility that international law has been violated and UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has called the shelling of the UN school in Rafah</p><p>&#8220;a moral outrage and a criminal act.&#8221;</p><p>Therefore it is imperative that a UN investigation is carried out with international partners and players.</p><p>We must show leadership. Indeed, the tone of the First Minister&#8217;s letter to the Prime Minister was that the UK must call for the matter to be dealt with urgently through international collaboration and leadership that has so far been missing.</p><p>I agree with Patricia Ferguson on how we should support peace. We believe in a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, the dismantling of the separation wall, the removal of illegal settlements and the lifting of the inhumane and illegitimate blockade of Gaza, which the Prime Minister has called an &#8220;open-air prison&#8221;.

We support the two-state solution, but action towards that must be immediate.</p><p>I agree with what was said about Hamas&#8217;s objectives and I, too, condemn those. Indeed, in every one of our six statements on the subject, whether from the First Minister or from me, we have been at pains to stress that rocket attacks on Israel are indiscriminate. They are designed to injure civilians; they are not targeted. No country should live with such a situation. However, according to international law, action must be proportionate.

If it goes off our TV screens and away from the pages of our newspapers, the Scottish Government will stand committed to calling for an immediate independent UN investigation. That was the nature and tone of the First Minister&#8217;s letter urging the Prime Minister to show urgency and leadership on the question, so that people who have violated international law are brought to justice, regardless of who they are. At the heart of the entire issue is the fact that compassion and justice have been missing.

We are not alone in that; the member will be aware that Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority and the representative of the Palestinian people on the west bank, does not call for a boycott of Israel. At the same time, the Scottish Government has made it clear that we do not dictate to cultural institutions, organisations or individuals what they should choose to do or not do.</p><p>The reason why we must have engagement is that every time the Government engages, be it with the Palestinians or with the Israelis, we put forward our concerns in the strongest possible terms.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>I congratulate the member&#8217;s constituent Robert McEwan. I have spoken to many young people and even children who have witnessed the scenes of devastation and destruction in Gaza and have been compelled to do something. In my constituency I walked past a bake sale whose proceeds were going to Gaza. People of all ages have been moved to do something.</p><p>On the wider issue, the humanitarian aid&#8212;the &#163;500,000&#8212;that we sent to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency&#8217;s Gaza flash appeal will go a long way, along with what other Governments have put into the pot, towards providing immediate assistance. That is important, because that is the priority at the moment.</p><p>In the longer term, we will continue to work with every international partner with whom we can work to exert pressure on the Israeli Government to lift the blockade. The blockade is making Gaza an open-air prison, where people are starving and dying a slow death. That is completely unacceptable and is utterly to be condemned. We will continue to make those calls and to work with whichever Government pursues the aim of lifting the blockade, to ensure that that happens.</p><p>On the displacement of people, very early on when the violence began to escalate, we made the offer that Scotland is ready to play her part in taking Palestinian refugees, if that will assist.

However, we have always supported the right of the Palestinians to a viable democratic state, and at the heart of the injustice over the past 60-odd years is the fact that, although Israel has the right to safety and security, the Palestinians have been denied a viable Palestinian state. We will do whatever the Palestinians believe is viable&#8212;and the Israelis believe is viable&#8212;in getting to such a position, within the two-state solution, with the 1967 borders and with Jerusalem as a shared capital.</p><p>The matter that the member raised is a decision for the Palestinians. As I said, we support Palestine&#8217;s enhanced status at the United Nations.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>I welcome the opportunity to highlight the special relationship that exists between Scotland and Malawi.</p><p>I thank members for attending the debate. I know how important the relationship is to members of all political persuasions across the chamber. Their attendance shows a real commitment to, and belief in, the relationship between our two countries. The timing of the debate is particularly appropriate, given the fact that the next round of the Malawi development fund opened this morning.</p><p>I was very involved in the Commonwealth games, as were members across the chamber, and I was asked constantly throughout my 11 days in Glasgow what my favourite part of the opening ceremony was. Was it the Irn Bru holding up the bridge, dancing Tunnock&#8217;s tea cakes or Nessie? That was of particular interest to our foreign dignitaries. All of that was, of course, great but my favourite moment by far was when Glasgow&#8217;s opening ceremony became the first opening ceremony ever to raise money for some of the poorest children throughout the Commonwealth. That first overshadows all the other firsts that we have had as a great city and a great country.</p><p>That was a great initiative in which to take pride, but the reason why people took such pride in it was that it highlighted our inherent feeling, as Glaswegians and Scots, that we have a responsibility to show our compassion on the world stage. I was pleased that that was a standout moment for many people.</p><p>This year, 2014, has also been a momentous year for Malawi. I was delighted to have the opportunity in January to take the Queen&#8217;s baton to Malawi, as it arrived there during its journey throughout the Commonwealth. I represented Scotland on the baton&#8217;s welcome to Lilongwe. It is a momentous year also because, in May, Malawi held its first ever tripartite elections. I congratulate the people of Malawi on those peaceful and stable elections and I welcome the new Government of Malawi. The Scottish Government, the chamber and, no doubt, the Parliament look forward to working with the new Government and parliamentarians for the mutual good of both our countries.</p><p>In his inaugural speech, which I read in great detail, President Professor Peter Mutharika spoke of Malawi being a young democracy and a country known for its political tolerance. He highlighted to his fellow Malawians that they had begun another leg of 50 years and that the next 50 years of their journey presented Malawi with an opportunity to reset its priorities, rethink its strategic focus and redefine Malawi as it makes progress. We want to continue to support the Malawian Government and its people on that second leg of their journey.</p><p>On 6 July this year, Malawi celebrated the 50th anniversary of its independence. I was delighted to attend the Scottish celebrations in Glasgow, which were organised largely by the Scotland Malawi Partnership. They were also attended by Lord McConnell and people from across the political spectrum. The celebrations had a real Malawian feel to them and affirmed the special and warm relationship between Malawi and Scotland. Diplomatic protocol and friendliness dictate that I not tell members the score of the table tennis match between me and the Malawian high commissioner, but it is fair to say that I won.</p><p>Scotland is an active player in international development. That reflects our historic outward-facing relationship with the world and our desire to be a good global citizen.</p><p>During the Commonwealth games, I spoke in the fantastic Empire Caf&#233; about some of the more unsavoury parts of Scotland&#8217;s history, such as the fact that Glasgow was the second city of the empire. At that event, there was a discussion in which the view was expressed that, for all the negative aspects of our history, we have a responsibility to the poorest and that, for all the slave owners that we had, we also had some of the greatest abolitionists, one of the greatest of whom was Dr David Livingstone, who undertook a journey to explore the Zambezi and took education to Malawi, helping to establish its educational infrastructure.</p><p>The Scottish Government has committed to continuing to contribute at least &#163;3 million a year to Malawi from our &#163;9 million international development budget. At present, we fund 40 projects that straddle all four of the strands of the 2005 co-operation agreement.</p><p>During the Commonwealth games, I had the privilege of meeting Malawi&#8217;s newly appointed Minister for Sports and Youth Development&#8212;who had been in her post for only three weeks&#8212;the honourable Grace Obama Chiumia. She described the relationship between Scotland and Malawi as being like that of sisters in a family. Like families do, we also played and competed together at the games. The Cabinet Secretary for Commonwealth Games, Sport, Equalities and Pensioners&#8217; Rights and I were present at the Scotland v Malawi netball game. For all that the Malawians are our sisters, I have to confess that they beat us pretty thoroughly. The cabinet secretary is a former netball player and was ready to get her trainers on, but time did not allow that to happen.</p><p>My visit to Malawi during the Queen&#8217;s baton relay was a phenomenal pleasure, because I got to see at first hand the impact that our international development projects are having. It is an enormous privilege to do that, as not everybody gets to see how the money is being spent. There are many who will question why we choose to spend the money on those projects but, having seen them at first hand, I can attest to the impact that they are having. Although we have a modest budget&#8212;of which we are all proud&#8212;the impact that it is having is quite unbelievable. I was shown the Malawi renewable energy acceleration programme&#8212;MREAP&#8212;and, when I visited one of the projects near the Mulanje mountain, I was told how the micro hydroelectric scheme that we are helping to fund and develop had allowed a woman in a nearby village to be the first woman there to give birth in a room with a light in it. That is unbelievable in the 21st century. Think about how many lights and how much energy we have.</p><p>I visited the fistula hospital that Ann Gloag set up. We are helping to fund a project there. Many people are aware of the condition, but consider a heavily pregnant woman who is about to go into labour walking up to 20km or 30km and then delivering a stillborn baby and ending up with a fistula that could leave her incontinent and which is in need of repair. Such women can be cast out by their communities or divorced by their husbands. Through the fistula hospital and the initiatives that we are funding, we are not only repairing fistulas, which gives the women a better quality of life, but we are providing the women with solar-powered batteries, which they can use to raise income from, for example, people using them to charge their telephones. That means that the women go from being outcasts to being leaders of business in their community.</p><p>As well as with the work on maternal health and renewable energy, I am pleased with what our initiatives are doing with regard to sustainable economic development. Although we believe that our aid is imperative and important, we also want to ensure that we can help Malawians to create local wealth, local businesses and local jobs in order to lift themselves out of poverty. That is why I was delighted to meet representatives of the Opportunity International Bank of Malawi, whose microfinance initiatives and projects we have funded before.</p><p>As I said earlier, education has always figured strongly in Scotland&#8217;s relationship with Malawi, and it does so to this day with the education that the Church of Scotland provides. I am delighted that, as part of the Livingstone bicentenary celebrations, we provided funding for 37 gifted and underprivileged Malawians to study masters degrees in Malawi, with the aim of keeping that local knowledge and those local skills within Malawi. We are going to be working hard to develop capacity and sustainability in the Malawian education system. Representatives of Education Scotland who were with me in Malawi signed an agreement with their Malawian counterparts in relation to the inspection system for schools in the country, which will help to drive up standards.</p><p>I remind members that the first of the Malawian triennial funding rounds opened earlier today. We look to distribute &#163;13 million over the period and I very much look forward to receiving applications.</p><p>In the first week that I was in this job, I noticed that the special relationship spans the length and breadth of the country and all sectors of society, from nurses to teachers to faith groups and everyone else. I put on record my thanks to groups such as the Scottish Malawi Partnership, its sister organisation the Malawi Scotland Partnership, the Network of International Development Organisations in Scotland and the many, many others who are involved in supporting the aims of the Government&#8217;s international development policy.</p><p>I look forward to listening to and participating in the debate as it unfolds and to accepting the amendments in the spirit of our consensual and collaborative approach on the issue of Malawi.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament congratulates the people of Malawi on their recent successful democratic elections; recognises that Scotland and Malawi have a special relationship that has endured for over 150 years and was formalised at governmental level in 2005 with the signing of the partnership agreement between the governments of Scotland and Malawi; notes that the basis of this relationship is one of reciprocity and mutual trust between the peoples and governments of both countries; recognises and welcomes the role of individuals and organisations across Scotland in supporting and developing Scotland&#8217;s special relationship with Malawi; further recognises that Scotland demonstrates its commitment to international development through the maintenance of the international development funds for Malawi and its other priority countries; notes that the Scottish Government&#8217;s engagement with Malawi and its other priority countries draws on Scottish knowledge, skills and expertise, historically in relation to health and education, as well as in response to new challenges, notably climate change and renewable energy, and further welcomes the next funding round for Malawi and the Scottish Government&#8217;s ambition for Scotland to be a good global leader in the field of international development, championing best practice and innovation in partner countries such as Malawi.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland and Malawi"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>It has been a shorter debate than usual because of various ministerial statements, but I have really enjoyed it, and I thank all those members who have taken part.</p><p>I have now had the pleasure of leading a debate on Scotland&#8217;s relationship with Malawi a couple of times, and it is one of those rare topics that brings everyone together, regardless of their political party. Although members have advice to give and rightly suggest that we should be a critical friend of Malawi, it is amazing that they can come together for an hour or so to praise one another in a giant love-in.</p><p>I give credit to previous Administrations. I am a great fan of all the work that Jack McConnell and the Administration behind him did to re-establish the relationship with Malawi. To his credit, Lord McConnell is happy to take phone calls whenever I need some advice on that relationship&#8212;well done for that.</p><p>Many members have said that the relationship that we have with Malawi, which has been about helping some of the poorest in the world through NGO-funded projects, needs to be about more than just aid. I want to touch on some of those themes.</p><p>Siobhan McMahon, Patricia Ferguson and others spoke about human rights and the importance of equality. It is absolutely correct that we raise those issues. Patricia Ferguson used the phrase &#8220;a critical friend&#8221;, and that is exactly what we must be. This Government condemns human rights abuses wherever they occur. In my meeting with the Malawian youth and sport minister, I mentioned Malawi&#8217;s human rights and the fact that Scotland is a tolerant and open country that believes in equality. I pointed to some of the steps that we have taken in that regard, such as the same-sex marriage legislation that we introduced. I said that we understood that Malawi operates in a regional context, that Malawi is on a journey and that we want it to make progress. We are willing to be partners and to allow our human rights agencies and civic society organisations to work with those in Malawi to help them to make further, much-needed progress. The minister welcomed that. I give members a reassurance that those issues were raised.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson was correct to mention the number of people and organisations that are involved in what is a two-way relationship. I have a great amount of time and affection for the Scotland Malawi Partnership, which does a fantastic amount of work. The fact that 400,000 people are involved in that relationship is incredible. The Scotland Malawi Partnership now has more than 700 members, which should be applauded.</p><p>As I said, in a collaborative spirit, I am happy to accept both amendments to the motion. We work closely with DFID in Malawi, and I met the head of DFID in Malawi to discuss how we might work together even more closely. I met Alan Duncan on the matter when he was the Minister of State for International Development, before he was moved in the reshuffle, and such engagement will continue, regardless of the constitutional set-up that we have post-18 September, because the UK and Scottish Governments have the joint goal of lifting the poorest in Malawi out of poverty.</p><p>I have always been fair in giving credit to DFID for the good work that it does, and I have met the staff who work in Abercrombie house. Patricia Ferguson was right to mention that, as well as benefiting from some of the work that DFID does, we can complement some of the work that it does. I gave evidence to the International Development Committee in the House of Commons in relation to Scottish independence, and in its final report it noted that the Scottish Government has a fantastic relationship with NGOs. I am paraphrasing&#8212;I might have added in the word &#8220;fantastic&#8221;&#8212;but it said that we have a good relationship with our NGOs and that DFID could take a leaf out of our book in how we work with civic society and NGOs.</p><p>I also agree whole-heartedly with Murdo Fraser and the Conservatives&#8217; amendment. Although the UK Government has been working with the Malawian Government in relation to civic governance, we would agree overwhelmingly that the credit for the peaceful democratic election would have to go to the people of Malawi, who have done well in their transition.</p><p>Murdo Fraser was also correct that Scots are extra generous when it comes to international development. Not only do we contribute through our tax money to the UK&#8217;s budget, which is 0.7 per cent of national income, but Scots of course also contribute towards our own efforts up here in Scotland. That gives me fantastic pride.</p><p>A number of members touched on various facets of the relationship that we have with Malawi, and I will try to rattle through some of them as well.</p><p>Sport was mentioned, and in my discussions with Maureen Watt&#8217;s pair member of Parliament&#8212;the Malawi youth and sport minister&#8212;I said that we can do more to develop that relationship. The Scottish Football Association is doing some projects in Malawi, but there is a lot more that we can do. I think that Malawi became a lot of people&#8217;s second team during the Commonwealth games because of the rapturous applause and welcome that they got at the opening ceremony. It was a close-run affair for me between Pakistan, for my father, and Kenya, for my mother; then there was the Tongalese athlete who came out with the Celtic top. It was difficult for me to choose, but Malawi was definitely there.</p><p>Murdo Fraser touched on commerce, as did a number of other members, including Christina McKelvie. I want to say a little more on that. Murdo Fraser mentioned the three Cs of Dr David Livingstone: Christianity, commerce and civilisation. We can debate the point about Christianity, because apparently Dr Livingstone converted only one person and even that person became a lapsed Christian. However, I am sure that his Christianity was espoused in other ways and methods.</p><p>The commerce one is really important, not only because of Dr David Livingstone but because one of the first European companies to set up in Malawi was the African Lakes Company of John and Frederick Moir, which was set up in the 1870s. Mandala house was the headquarters of the company in Blantyre in Malawi. Although the company is now dissolved, Mandala house is still there and it still has pictures of the headquarters in Renfield Street in Glasgow. The company was renamed Mandala, and even many senior members of the Government had family who worked at the Mandala corporation. That includes former president Joyce Banda, whose mother worked there. The name still resonates in terms of ethical and fair trade, because the company was also set up to defeat the slave trade.</p><p>Sarah Boyack touched on the energy relationship. She made her points very well and very strongly. Paul Wheelhouse and I were delighted to host and take part in the European launch of the United Nations decade of sustainable energy for all during the Commonwealth games in Glasgow. We had a very passionate keynote speech from and a panel discussion with the UN secretary general&#8217;s special representative, Dr Yumkella.</p><p>I have mentioned trade, but Sarah Boyack also touched on fair trade. We have given our commitment to support that in any way that we can, which has helped Scotland to become the second Fairtrade nation in the world. I know that Mzuzu coffee is already being traded here. In the business conference that was jointly hosted for the Commonwealth games by the Prime Minister and the First Minister, I hosted a panel session on trade and investment and how we can lift countries out of poverty by closer trade links, so I am happy to commit to working on that.</p><p>Richard Simpson spoke with great authority and depth on the health side of things, and I agree with much of what he said. The temptation for a Scottish Government, be it part of the UK or even independent, might be to try to do too much and be everything to everybody. Richard Simpson was right to say that we should concentrate on a couple of narrow fields of health to make a big impact. He touched on the issue of infectious diseases. I mentioned that issue when I gave evidence to the International Development Committee, and Jeremy Lefroy MP, who is very involved in the global fund in terms of tackling infectious diseases, wrote me a nice card to say that he thought that our approach on the issue was to be welcomed.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland and Malawi"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>Yes.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland and Malawi"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/25119.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "image_width": 78, "person_id": "25119", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Humza Yousaf", "member_id": "80493", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Glasgow"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Bob", "last_name": "Doris", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>Thank you for finding the time, Presiding Officer. I know that time has been tight in the debate.</p><p>I became politically active when I was 17 years old because of a UK Tory Government that Scotland did not elect, that was not accountable to Scotland and that did not represent the values of the people of Scotland. I am now 41 years old and I see another UK Tory Government wreaking havoc in the communities that I represent. That is a fundamental reason why I want a yes vote.</p><p>I get sick and tired of hearing misty-eyed romanticism about the UK. That does not exist in the towns, cities and villages across Scotland, but let me tell members what does exist there. Food banks exist in the towns, cities and villages across Scotland. Men, women and children are going to food banks because of the &#163;6 billion of UK welfare reforms in the past five years. I know individual female constituents who are now unemployed because of reforms to the tax credit system. Working poor are now benefit-dependent poor.</p><p>I also know individual constituents who are among the 100,000 adults with disabilities who are being targeted by the current UK Government and are, to be frank, terrified that the abandonment of disability living allowance and the move to personal independence payments and the roll-out of universal credit will leave them much poorer. I know families whose kids have been pushed into poverty because of UK tax credit reforms for children. No member in the chamber should give me misty-eyed romanticism about the UK, because it did not exist then and it does not exist now. We want a better future for the people of Scotland.</p><p>In the minute or so that I have left, I will make some suggestions. One is to increase the minimum wage by at least inflation every year. The poorest workers would have been &#163;600 better off in the past five years had a UK Government done that. Another is to abolish the roll-out of PIP, which is a commitment that this Scottish Government has given. Another is a root-and-branch review of benefit sanctions that are targeting the most vulnerable in society. That would happen with a yes vote.</p><p>Another is to uprate carers allowance in line with jobseekers allowance so that the weakest people in society can benefit. Another is to make the tax system fairer, particularly for women, with an earnings disregard that would allow women to earn more money before benefits started to be clawed back. Those are real equality measures.</p><p>Do you know something, Presiding Officer? It kind of does not matter whether any member in the chamber agrees with any of the suggestions that I make. The people of Scotland will decide, in the first election after Scotland votes for Scottish independence, how we make society fairer and more socially just. However, one thing is for sure.

We had the revelation from John Mason that he is too old to be responsibly left in charge of a foam finger and Sandra White has confirmed that Glasgow people are great at telling people where to go. Both those things are true.</p><p>This excellent debate has not only paid tribute to the wonderful success of our Commonwealth games athletes but, just as significant, covered how the success of the games can be consolidated, sustained and built on. I am proud that these have been Glasgow&#8217;s games, but they have also very much been Scotland&#8217;s games, as we have heard. Such has been the success that most communities feel that they have some connection to a successful sportsman or woman.</p><p>I know how excited my nieces, who are both keen swimmers, were when Ross Murdoch won his gold medal, as he is a Vale of Leven lad. He trained at the swimming pool where Beth and Emily, my two young nieces, swim with the local club. As a Vale boy originally, I felt a little civic pride. I started my swimming experience at the Vale baths at the age of six, although I should put it on the record that I did not learn to swim until I was 16, in the Brock baths in Dumbarton&#8212;I was a late bloomer.</p><p>We should not underestimate the boost that such success will give young sportspeople across Scotland and the civic pride that will be fostered across Scotland&#8217;s towns, cities and villages by not just the medal-winning sportsmen and women but all those who participated. Tavish Scott made that point well.</p><p>I pay tribute to the partnership work between the Scottish Government, local councils and sportscotland to develop about 150 community sport hubs. That is already a lasting legacy. The hubs bring together sports clubs, community assets and volunteers from clubs to work together and get a greater outcome for young people who are involved in sport. That is already showing some wonderful successes.</p><p>To build on that, I commend the Scottish Government&#8217;s Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill as an opportunity for community assets such as community centres and sports facilities, which do not always appear to have a long-term strategy or use in communities, to provide community-owned, community-developed and community-led sports initiatives. That could be a significant success in a number of places in Glasgow; it could improve the quality of facilities, which could be enhanced, and they could be used more. I am sure that the Scottish Government, sportscotland, Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Life would be very much on board with that. That approach is in keeping with the bill&#8217;s aspirations across society.</p><p>It is only right to mention the fantastic job that Glasgow City Council, Glasgow Life and all the civic partners in the city that I represent did in contributing to a wonderfully successful games. I merely comment on where opportunities to build further on that sit.</p><p>With national governing bodies of sport, the Scottish Government and sportscotland have invested greatly in developing club sports to boost grass-roots participation and&#8212;just as important&#8212;to ensure that our most talented sportsmen and women excel. How wonderful that programme has been&#8212;it was greatly successful. We had 19 gold medals and 53 medals in total.</p><p>Just as significant is the fact that Scotland had the largest team ever. Having the opportunity to compete at such a level is vital for the confidence of our sportsmen and women and for society in general. Scotland has never seen anything like it.</p><p>In the time that is left, I will talk a little about sporting pathways. A similar point was made about volunteers. As with anything in society, those from more middle-class backgrounds who have a little more money find it easier to access, identify and progress on pathways in life. Sport is not necessarily any different.</p><p>In my intervention on John Mason, I mentioned that I was going to the women&#8217;s weightlifting at the Commonwealth games when he, as a volunteer, directed me so ably to the venue. I am following weightlifting more and more because of my association with the Gladiator Programme in Easterhouse. It is already having wonderful success with young boys and girls going to Europe and winning gold medals for Scotland at the ages of 12, 13 and 14. The hope is that, in August 2015, participants will be at the under-15 European championships to represent Britain. There is the potentiality of an athlete pathway award to enable them to go there. I also note that, in Samoa in September of the same year, there will be another event in which they will have the opportunity to represent Scotland.</p><p>I raise that for a specific reason. Will the minister look at where the sporting pathways are for those young boys and girls from Easterhouse and beyond to progress to the next level in weightlifting, as the volunteers do a wonderful job? They have had support, but it is about that extra push and nudge to support them to go to the next level. I am sure that there are stories across the country, and I know that money has to be spent in the wisest possible way, but that is an area that I am passionate about.</p><p>In conclusion, the Commonwealth games were clearly a wonderful success, but they will have a true legacy only if we work at it. The real hard work starts now. It is wonderful to cheer people over the finishing line and to win medals, but the tough bit is developing things from here on in.</p><p>It has been a pleasure to take part in the debate.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>I will try to be brief and to stick to amendment 6.</p><p>I am content that the general power under section 85(5) would be adequate in relation to the commencement order in section 22B, which was added to the bill at stage 2 by my amendment.

I hope that my fellow members and people who have come through from Royston can join me in committee room 6 after the debate for refreshments; everyone would be most welcome.</p><p>I wanted the motion to be debated for two main reasons. First, I wanted the good work of the people and organisations in Royston to be recognised in what is a special year for many of them, as we will hear. Secondly, I wanted to draw to the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s attention the newly formed Royston strategy group, which is a community-led forum that wishes to see meaningful regeneration in an area where poverty has endured for too long. The Royston strategy group includes the Rosemount Development Trust, Royston Youth Action and local housing associations, to name but a few of its members, who also include me and my fellow MSP Patricia Ferguson.</p><p>I will briefly place regeneration in its historical context. Many still call Royston the Garngad. The area was renamed &#8220;Royston&#8221; in the 1940s; that was a marketing ploy as part of the Glasgow Corporation&#8217;s plans for housing action, which rolled out over subsequent decades and led to many in the 1950s moving away from Garngad to the new estates of the day.</p><p>In 1953, Mick McLaughlin wrote the poem &#8220;Farewell to Garngad&#8221;, in which he said:</p><p>&#8220;Oh Father dear and did you hear, new houses they have built</p><p>Some of them in Easterhouse and some in Castlemilk</p><p>Balornock and Barmulloch too, they&#8217;re building them like mad</p><p>And now they&#8217;re taking our friends away</p><p>From the dear old Garngad.&#8221;</p><p>That is a poetic description of some of the problems that have been faced over the years.</p><p>More recently, the situation has been much more positive. In the past few decades, hundreds of rented homes and owner-occupied houses have been renovated or built anew in the area. Although there is still work to do, housing in Royston has improved dramatically in recent years. The development plans of the likes of Blochairn Housing Association, Spire View Housing Association and Copperworks Housing Co-operative must take much of the credit for that.</p><p>Local housing directors such as Michael Carberry and Fiona Murphy have not only spearheaded several development projects but been a face of housing and regeneration in the area. Tenant representatives such as Joan Reuston and Charlie Lunn certainly ensure that regeneration is directly community led.</p><p>Improving housing is vital, but housing associations and others recognise that housing alone does not improve life chances. Because of concern about poverty and high unemployment rates, Royston residents created the Rosemount Development Trust in 1989. By 1993, the local Millburn centre had been refurbished and was ready for tenants to use. The goal was to reduce unemployment rates and aid the fight against poverty. Just six years later, the trust completed new premises at Rosemount workspace, which provided more jobs and opportunities.</p><p>Maureen Flynn represents what ambition and a desire to serve can do. She was raised in Royston and has been involved with Rosemount for 24 years. She directly benefited by finding employment via the organisation and she has supported many others to do likewise. She is now the organisation&#8217;s director and is doing a marvellous job of advancing its reach and accomplishing its worthwhile goals.</p><p>A variety of other excellent organisations are contributing significantly to regenerative efforts. I will list just a few&#8212;they include Royston Youth Action, Toonspeak Young People&#8217;s Theatre, Rosemount Lifelong Learning, the Flexicentre and local churches and schools.</p><p>I very much hope that I have painted a vibrant picture of Royston, which is a vibrant place, as I am increasingly finding out. However, there is also a much more challenging story. An estimated 26 per cent of the Royston population receives or depends completely on benefits. An estimated 24 per cent of the working-age population there are unemployed. Four of the five data zones that cover Royston are in the bottom 10 per cent in Scotland for educational attainment. Gaining skills and further educational achievements is critical.</p><p>The organisations that I have mentioned are aware of the scale of the problem and are busy putting into action approaches to deal with the challenges. I am sure that others will talk about this year&#8217;s inspireROYSTON programme, which is just one example of engagement with all in Royston to celebrate their community and their heritage and&#8212;more important&#8212;to look to the future.</p><p>What can the Royston strategy group, which I mentioned at the start, achieve? The first thing that it can do is listen to the community and find out what its priorities are. It is doing that. Some of the work is already under way with a community consultation that is being led by Community Links Scotland. It has spoken to many families about what they perceive to be local needs. The potential need for a new community facility for older people in the area is beginning to emerge. Some have mentioned the lack of shopping opportunities, particularly for fresh fruit and vegetables and particularly around the Roystonhill area. As that area&#8217;s name suggests, it is particularly difficult for older residents to get around it. The quality of transport links has also been raised.</p><p>We can do much to address those issues. The Royston strategy group has the good will of Glasgow City Council, and much can be achieved when Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government want to take action. There is a joint responsibility there. That is why I said that, whenever the Royston strategy group comes forward with proposals and recommendations, I hope that the local authority will consider them, back them and take action to achieve them. The Scottish Government must also do so, where there are opportunities to support that action.</p><p>There are good examples of that. For example, there was joint work to get more than &#163;1 million for Maryhill burgh halls; there was joint action between the council and the Government to get more than &#163;1 million for a new community centre in Cadder; and there was more than &#163;1 million for a new watersports centre at Port Dundas. All those areas are in north Glasgow and all have issues that are similar to Royston&#8217;s issues. All the work involved partnership work between the city council and the Scottish Government.</p><p>The regeneration fund is one type of funding. That possible pot of cash is a &#163;25 million Scottish Government fund across Scotland, and that is where Cadder Housing Association got its money from. Local authorities are asked to prioritise their bids in order of importance when bids go in. I would like to think that, in future years, when Glasgow City Council decides where it wishes the Scottish Government to prioritise, Royston will feature with the highest priority.</p><p>Any regeneration activity must be completely community led. It must be led not by the priorities of politicians but by the priorities of the local community. That is what the Royston strategy group hopes to achieve. The legacy from this special year can be deep and meaningful and can stretch for years to come.</p><p>If Mick McLaughlin had written his poem in the next few years rather than in 1953, I would have hoped that he might have called it &#8220;The Flourishing of Garngad&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;Farewell to Garngad&#8221;. A community that is strengthened by investment that is led by its own priorities will deliver, despite challenges. I have no illusions about that. Royston, or Garngad, is a vibrant community that needs help and assistance. I am sure that, with partnership working, we can all deliver.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Royston (Regeneration)"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>One of the reasons why I wanted other Glasgow MSPs to speak in the debate is that I am looking for best practice in community regeneration to be shared across the city and beyond.

People may use generic terms and describe floods of immigrants coming to the country but, if one breaks it down and engages with people on the basics, the view is different. If one talks about international students, who are keeping our higher education system afloat by paying huge fees to come to this country, people tend to say, &#8220;Well, of course that is okay.&#8221;</p><p>If one explains that many Scottish people and people from across the UK are taking benefits in other European countries, because they are staying there and have made a life for themselves, and when one outlines the facts about Scottish people going to other European countries and other people coming to Scotland, people tend to say, &#8220;Actually, that seems to be okay.&#8221;</p><p>When one explains to people, as members have mentioned today, that asylum seekers are fleeing war-torn countries&#8212;I have had direct experience of dealing with constituents in that situation&#8212;they tend to say, &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p><p>However, those views are not what we tend to read in the mainstream press. If the narrative is correct and deals with the facts about immigration to these shores, the people of Scotland&#8212;and, I believe, of the United Kingdom&#8212;are far more tolerant and inclusive than certain attitude surveys let on. We, as politicians, all have an opportunity to show leadership in putting the facts about the situation on the record.</p><p>I will share a brief story about a constituent of mine called Ako, who was in my office the other day. People would see him and say, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s another immigrant coming to my country.&#8221; I will not get into the personal details of his story, but he was looking to be returned to Mosul. I do not think that he will be going there any time soon.</p><p>I represent a swathe of constituents in relation to asylum and refugee cases. Quite a lot of them are Kurds, because of the connection that I have with the Kurdish community in Glasgow. They are dependent on the court ruling in the case of Bakhtear Rashid&#8212;apologies to Kurds and the legal profession for my pronunciation&#8212;which I believe refers to when someone came to the UK, whether they came to it from the Kurdish region or from the rest of Iraq and whether Saddam Hussein was in power when they came. All of that is used to determine whether people are allowed to stay. The people whom I meet have been here for a long time and, frankly, this is their home. They make an incredible contribution to our country. That gives a flavour of the kind of refugees and asylum seekers whom I meet, and of immigrants to our shores more generally.</p><p>Politicians often talk about the good work that other people do rather than the work that we do, so I put on record the work of the police in relation to asylum seekers. I remember when I became an MSP in 2007 meeting Constable Harry Faulds, a community police officer in Sighthill in Glasgow who has since retired. He did exceptional work to bring communities together. I also mention the Maryhill Integration Network, which my colleague Patricia Ferguson will know well and which does fine work on inclusiveness and integration in Glasgow, the area that I represent.</p><p>The Scottish Government strategy is called &#8220;New Scots: Integrating Refugees in Scotland&#8217;s Communities&#8221;. Members could speak in support of that strategy irrespective of their position on the constitution and an independent Scotland, as it makes no attempt to raise the issue of independence. It contains a set of principles on integrating people in our communities that we would all like to see in society. That is the tone in which I make my remarks.</p><p>On the needs of dispersed asylum seekers&#8212;I hate the term &#8220;dispersed&#8221;, but there we are&#8212;the strategy states:</p><p>&#8220;The long-term strategic planning of the dispersal of asylum seekers in Scotland is informed by the needs of asylum seekers and local communities leading to an increase in integration&#8221;.</p><p>When that is done well, it benefits a community, but it has not always been done particularly well. Initially, there were difficult and challenging situations at Sighthill and Red Road, but things have improved since then. I pay tribute to everyone who has been on board in relation to that.</p><p>My intervention on Alison McInnes was on housing, so I should refer to that issue in my remaining time. Significant concerns have been raised by the Scottish Refugee Council and a number of my constituents about the housing contract that UKBA has in relation to asylum seekers and refugees in Glasgow with Serco and Orchard &amp; Shipman. We have been working on a cross-party basis to deal with that. I made representations to Margaret Burgess on what the Scottish Government could do through housing standards and regulation. It can do almost nothing, but I will continue to press on the issue to encourage constructive dialogue.</p><p>Some of the social tensions in relation to housing for asylum seekers and refugees are exactly the same as those relating to homeless people. There are a series of supported tenancies across the city of Glasgow with a high turnover of individuals, which is not good for sustainable communities. We must turn some of those tenancies into permanent ones so that we embed people in the heart of their communities, but that is not how the system works.</p><p>Presiding Officer, thank you for indulging me, as always, in sneaking an extra half minute into my speech.

There has been consensus about that, even if there has not been consensus about how to achieve it.</p><p>I will say a little bit about the affordability of pensions. It is worth noting that 42 per cent of Scottish revenues go towards social protections&#8212;I am talking about all the moneys that Scotland spends on not just pensioners but those who are unemployed and those with disability and everything else. However, on a UK basis, the figure is 43 per cent. I give that figure because, although some have suggested that pensions will be less affordable in an independent Scotland, the figure suggests that they would be more affordable in an independent Scotland. Given that that has been part of the debate, it is important to put the figure on the record.</p><p>I also put on the record the fact that in 2012-13, 15.5 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s gross domestic product was spent on that form of social protection, but in the UK such spending was at a higher level, at 16 per cent. On affordability, we can quite clearly say that pensions are more affordable in Scotland than across the rest of the UK. That is just a fact that we should all learn to accept, just as we can also accept the DWP&#8217;s confirmation that the state pension has a cast-iron guarantee in an independent Scotland. The only thing that we are arguing about now is whether there will be a higher increase for new pensioners in Scotland than for other people in the UK. In any debate, that is not a bad position to be in. We also know that, because of the contractual arrangements, occupational and private pensions are safe for pensioners in an independent Scotland. That is important for our older population.</p><p>We are really talking about the increase in the UK retirement age, and it is not a glib promise to Scottish pensioners if an independent Scotland does not increase the retirement age.

We have heard that women reaching 65 will, under current pension plans, be likely to receive &#163;11,000 less over the course of their retirement because of poorer life expectancy in Scotland.</p><p>As a Glasgow MSP, it is reasonable for me to put on the record the fact that males in Glasgow&#8212;on average; as we have heard, some males in Glasgow live to a ripe old age and are hale and hearty for a long time&#8212;will receive &#163;29,000 less in their old age compared with people elsewhere in the UK.

I would like to be in the difficult situation that the UK Government is in because of the increase in life expectancy, but that is not the case in Scotland. I say to the Labour Party that we can fix it for the working-class males of Scotland, particularly those in Glasgow, who work hard all their lives and pay into a pension that they will never receive because of poor life expectancy, and we should fix it.</p><p>I want to say a couple of positive things about the NHS in Scotland, which our older people use more than any other group. Mr Findlay&#8217;s call for a fundamental root-and-branch review of the NHS misses the point completely because of the way in which the NHS operates.

I believe that Scotland can be proud of the debate that has been taking place. What has re-energised Scottish politics has been not members of the Scottish Parliament debating here in the chamber, or other politicians and political parties, large or small, but the broad, creative, inclusive national debate that has been taking place in communities throughout Scotland.

There are opportunities, not just for Scots to make decisions about our domestic affairs but for a better relationship within these islands.</p><p>Whether there is a yes vote or a no vote, there will be a danger that politicians on the winning side will be triumphalist and decide that they know what is best. In the case of a no vote, that will be one flavour of devo max or another. I have friends and party colleagues who might vote no in the referendum, but none of them is voting no because they are signed up to one of the&#8212;in my view&#8212;slightly dubious versions of devo max that have come from the UK political parties, which seem to me to be designed not to transfer the ability to run different economic policy in Scotland but rather to transfer the responsibility for implementing the cuts that will come from ideological austerity economics south of the border.</p><p>I also have friends and colleagues who will vote yes in September&#8212;indeed, like me, most of my party colleagues will do so. We might be voting yes in sympathy with some of the elements in the famous 650 answers in the white paper, but we are not in sympathy with all of them. We will vote yes on the basis of a question. Every member in this chamber, and every voter in the country, will vote yes or no on the basis of the question that is printed in black and white on the ballot paper. Should Scotland be an independent country?</p><p>The ethos of participative engaging and re-engaging in political debate that we have enjoyed over the past few months would be undermined if the winning side in either scenario pulled up the drawbridge and said, &#8220;We know what to do next, on every question.&#8221; A mandate on issues that are currently reserved will be sought in 2016 if we are independent; it is not what is sought next month.</p><p>For example, the Greens will never agree with Governments, whether they are in Edinburgh or London, who simply want to secure the conditions in which to maximise oil and gas extraction, burning through the stuff ever faster. There is an absolute contradiction between the goal of extracting fossil fuels from the North Sea ever faster and the goal of keeping carbon fossil fuels out of the atmosphere, to which both Governments, north and south of the border, have committed.</p><p>We will never agree with the exposure of our economies, not just in Scotland but throughout the UK and in much of the western world, to the carbon bubble. A dramatically overvalued industry is sitting on reserves of four or five times more carbon than we can afford ever to burn. We need to break our reliance on the carbon bubble before it bursts.</p><p>I finish on a point on which I am sure that we can all agree&#8212;I certainly hope so. It is not so very long since we gathered in what used to be our temporary home, at the top of the Royal Mile, to mourn the passing of our friend Margo MacDonald and to hear of her call for us to treat one another as opponents, perhaps, but never enemies in this debate. In these last few weeks, every one of us has a responsibility to remember that, every day that we get out of bed and go into the communities that we represent in Scotland to continue the debate. We have a responsibility to remember it every day as we end our campaigning&#8212;to treat one another with respect and to have the debate in the spirit of friendship that Scotland deserves.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>I thank the minister for her statement, which acknowledged the importance of sustaining democracy in the workplace, as does recommendation 17 in the report, which seeks to give the proposed new body a role in increasing democracy in the workplace.

Bruce Kent&#8217;s voice in the debate is a familiar and much-respected one. He reminded us of the history of the anti-nuclear movement in the UK and shared with us something of the hope that is felt by activists north and south of the border that Scotland can lead the way by voting yes to independence and then giving an unequivocal no to nuclear weapons.</p><p>Many members will have heard before Bruce Kent outline the moral arguments against weapons of mass destruction, principal among which, of course, is the inability of nuclear weapons to discriminate between civilian and military targets. They are capable only of the mass slaughter of innocent people.</p><p>In the past few weeks, the world has reacted with horror to the civilian deaths that have been meted out in Gaza and the indiscriminate action that has not discriminated between civilian and military targets. It should be crystal clear that any country that used nuclear weapons in any context would be a pariah state for generations to come.</p><p>In addition, there is a moral dimension to what nuclear weapons symbolise&#8212;their cultural meaning. As my favourite fictional Prime Minister, Harry Perkins, put it when announcing the dismantling of Britain&#8217;s nuclear weapons:</p><p>&#8220;with this action, we shall also be dismantling the idea that our freedom somehow depends on the fear of annihilation. It is an absurd and obscene idea. We want no part of it.&#8221;</p><p>I hope that we can capture the ambition to turn that fiction into reality.</p><p>Ward Wilson, on the other hand, used yesterday&#8217;s meeting to outline the strategic arguments. His case, which is compelling, is that the ideology of nuclear weapons is based on myths that need to be exposed. There is the myth that nuclear weapons won the second world war. We can and should mourn the lives that were lost in such vast numbers in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but even after all this time, there remains no definitive reason to believe that either nuclear attack was the key event that led to the Japanese surrender. The Soviet Union&#8217;s entry into the war precipitated the immediate political response by Japan&#8217;s Supreme Council. The Japanese historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa has stated:</p><p>&#8220;The Soviet entry into the war played a much greater role than the atomic bombs in inducing Japan to surrender because it dashed any hope that Japan could terminate the war through Moscow&#8217;s mediation&#8221;.</p><p>The second myth is that nuclear weapons represent a leap in decisiveness. Even at the time of their development, that was a dubious claim. The bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki certainly killed on a mass scale, but so too did the firebombing that preceded them. The firebombing of Tokyo alone killed well over 100,000 people. That was on a par with the bombing of Hiroshima.</p><p>Seen from today&#8217;s perspective, that argument is even less credible. Nuclear weapons are the messiest and clumsiest of the weapons available. They are not only incapable of discriminating between civilian and military targets; they are incapable of reliable geographical targeting. To use them against a neighbour would be suicidal; even to use them against a distant state would have an incalculable impact on others nearby. At a time when military innovation is focused on precise, targeted and so-called surgical weapons, Trident and its like begin to look like an absurd relic and as convincing a piece of technology as the blunderbuss.</p><p>Thirdly, there is the myth that deterrence is safe and reliable. Nuclear weapons have shown themselves to be unable to deter states from taking illegal and unacceptable conventional action against their neighbours, as the situation in Ukraine demonstrates, despite that country&#8217;s membership of NATO&#8217;s partnership for peace. Beyond that, we should acknowledge the long history of near-miss incidents in which threats, accidents and even weather phenomena have been misinterpreted and could easily have led to nuclear exchanges with catastrophic consequences.</p><p>Nuclear deterrence is inherently unsafe, unstable and precarious. On the myth that nuclear weapons have kept the peace for 60 years, can anyone seriously look at the history of the past 60 years and say that, as we were told at the time, there is a clear dividing line between the pre-nuclear age and the post-nuclear age? We can look around the world and see the proliferation of conventional weapons. We can also see the UK&#8217;s record in wars, whether or not the involvement was for reasons we called justified, and the continued power of the arms industry. Nuclear technology has not kept the peace.</p><p>Finally, there is the myth that the nuclear genie cannot be put back into the bottle. The argument that nuclear weapons cannot be uninvented may be true, but that does not confer utility on a technology that has no useful purpose. There is a clear possibility and a growing momentum for a global ban on nuclear weapons, as was shown at the conference that was attended by more than 140 Governments in Mexico earlier this year.</p><p>A written constitution can achieve a ban on nuclear weapons in Scotland. Not only that, it can challenge the nonsense that a journey from unilateral disarmament to multilateral disarmament is in any way compatible with the UK&#8217;s policy of unilateral rearmament. I can only imagine the Commonwealth standard of mental gymnastics required to make that link. A yes vote is not simply about moving nuclear weapons from one place to another; it is about tipping the balance in the rest of the UK as well and winning the case against the renewal of this vicious system.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-10724.2, to leave out from &#8220;, and confirms&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;and a constitutional ban on nuclear weapons in Scotland; confirms its commitment to working with nuclear and non-nuclear states to create the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons; supports a global ban on nuclear weapons, and considers that the removal of Trident from Scotland would strengthen the case against renewal of the UK Government&#8217;s nuclear arsenal.&#8221;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>Will the member take an intervention?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>Would Mr McMahon acknowledge, simply as a matter of fact, that during this era of nuclear deterrence as a strategic concept the world has seen an increase in the number of nuclear states, not a decrease?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>I begin by taking on the suggestion that those of us who will vote yes and support disarmament all disrespect or resent in some way the diversity of views that exist on the other side of the independence debate. People would be pretty hard pressed to find anyone in the Green Party who wants to hang on to Trident, but they will find some. A small minority of our members will vote no and are not convinced of the case for independence. We are capable of having that debate in a spirit of respect and friendship. It is important for me to say that, because that is the spirit of debate that Scotland deserves.</p><p>Even though I disagree with it, I respect the position that is taken by some in the Labour Party who recognise that only a small minority of their members or MSPs might consider voting yes but who support the principle of disarmament.</p><p>I agree with Michael McMahon that this is not a nationalistic issue; this goal should be able to unite us across the independence divide. I merely suggest to those in my party and to others who are voting no and who want disarmament that we should apply the same test of realpolitik that Malcolm Chisholm suggests that we think about in the context of post-yes negotiations.</p><p>There may well be people on the Labour benches and elsewhere who are utterly sincere&#8212;I am convinced that they are&#8212;about their values over disarmament, but we know which way the 2015 decision will go. If the UK Parliament, in any conceivable balance of power after the 2015 election, makes that decision we know that it will renew Trident&#8212;let us be honest about that reality.</p><p>The economic argument has also been made and explored. There is an economic argument for getting rid of Trident. It is not the one that I put at the top of my list most often in these debates because, frankly, I would be for scrapping the thing even if it cost us money to do so instead of saving us money. I acknowledge that we will hear of a range of priorities for how best to use the &#163;100 billion or so that would be saved over the long term by not replacing Trident. I could write a long list of priorities myself. Personally, I regard as the icing on the cake the privilege of being able to debate what our priorities for that money would be. Let us face it: there is work that needs doing that will have social, economic and environmental benefits for our society. The opportunity to create dramatically more jobs than Trident could ever create is one that I look forward to being able to debate.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>I suppose I would welcome that but, let us face it, that will not happen either, because we are dealing with an ideological position.</p><p>The strategic argument&#8212;any kind of strategic argument that says why possessing a nuclear weapon system is a good idea&#8212;has often been lacking. Annabel Goldie got closest to it, although she seemed to suggest that the strategic concept has not changed much since the cold war and that somehow we need nuclear weapons in order not to have nuclear war. That seems a very bizarre argument to me.</p><p>Let us remember that the promise at the beginning of this bizarre psychological experiment of mutually assured destruction was that it would keep the peace; it was not only that it would prevent nuclear war, but that it would prevent the power blocs from attacking each other conventionally. That has monumentally failed. Of course it failed, because it is based on the dehumanising ideology of game theory. At no point has anyone proposed an actual strategic benefit from possession of a weapon that could only ever be used if the finger on the button belonged to a psychopath.</p><p>The arguments around having a written constitution have also been raised. I know that there are arguments for and against having a single, codified written constitution. Iain Gray and I have debated that previously. However, whether we look at a single constitutional document or hundreds of years of constitutional documentation, constitutions should not just be a dry approach to the mechanisms of government but convey something about how we conceive ourselves, what kind of country we are and our values and ambitions. A commitment to peace should be central in that. A written constitution should have, as John Finnie said, not only a commitment to oppose weapons of mass destruction but a commitment to build economic, social and environmental justice around the world, which is the only long-term protection for human security and the only way for our world to move beyond the obsession with war and the aggressive projection of military power.</p><p>The final point that I want to make is to colleagues in the SNP. I have not heard this argument from their leadership&#8212;I am pleased about that&#8212;but I have heard it from colleagues in the SNP, who suggest that Trident has been used by the MOD to block the exploitation of oil on the west coast. If so, that is the only useful utility that Trident ever gave us. Swapping one weapon of mass destruction for another is not the vision that I subscribe to. If anyone ever sees the abolition of Trident as an excuse for the exploitation of oil on the west coast, there will&#8212;believe me&#8212;still be protest and debate and I will still be willing to risk arrest to stop it.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>Will the member give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>Will Mr Johnstone give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>Will the member give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>Will the member give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>I congratulate the Scottish Government on the clear stance that it has taken on the horrific events of the past few weeks, and I endorse the call for an arms embargo.</p><p>The minister will be aware that there has also been a call for a wider programme of boycotts, divestment and sanctions targeted at the Israeli Government.

Yes, we can, because we in Scotland understand our economy&#8217;s unique challenges and opportunities better than anyone else, and for the first time we will have the full powers that are required to improve the situation. Yes, we can, because the Opposition parties in the chamber will be freed from the need to take orders from London and will have the opportunity genuinely to put their shoulders to the wheel and to abandon bad politics in favour of good economics.</p><p>In any case, it is not the often-quoted headline statistics that are the only matter of economic importance; the sharing of that wealth is also crucial. Although an independent Scotland has been ranked 14 by the OECD, this does not feel like a wealthy country to most people. Scotland&#8217;s enormous wealth is not being shared equally, and that inequality is itself a drag factor on our economy, limiting demand and the success of our businesses. Inequality is a challenge that we will be able to address properly after independence, so I hope that instead of denying that poverty exists, the Opposition parties will join us in our endeavour to make Scotland a fairer as well as a more prosperous country.</p><p>There is also the question of what we do with that wealth to improve our quality of life. It is no coincidence that Orkney and Shetland, the only parts of the UK with oil funds, also happen to score very highly in UK quality-of-life surveys. That suggests that public rather than private goods contribute more to quality of life than the Westminster mindset can imagine. Devolution of 100 per cent of the Crown Estate revenues, which will fall to us after independence, will be significant in tackling the regional inequality that many of Scotland&#8217;s island communities have faced for many generations.</p><p>The only economic argument that is left in the unionist arsenal is the sharing of risk, and that somehow bigger is better. However, we have just experienced the worst economic crisis since the great depression, and being big did not save the banks, the UK or the United States. Indeed, many small countries including Norway and Denmark did not experience the crisis at all. As for sharing of risk, we all know how that works: the poor are made to pay for the failures of the rich. Indeed, that is happening right now. That is how that so-called insurance policy has always worked, but it is not a policy that has ever served Scotland well.</p><p>Three chapters of the white paper &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future&#8221; are devoted to the economy. The plan is well thought out and credible, and it is informed by the thinking of the Council of Economic Advisers, which is by a long stretch the most formidable array of economic talent in the UK. In contrast, the no campaign has no plan beyond project fear; we have certainly not heard an economic plan from the no people this afternoon. Project fear is a plan that is offensive to many Scots, who are sick of being patronised in that way by unionist politicians.</p><p>With good political, economic and financial leadership, the scales are tipped heavily in favour of Scotland&#8217;s prosperity and economic success after independence.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>I am not a member of the Education and Culture Committee, but I am pleased to speak in the debate because I spent much of my previous career renovating, repairing and maintaining old buildings.

We cannot easily prevent neglect and eventual ruin, and we cannot easily legislate to provide value. We need only look at the Scottish Civic Trust&#8217;s buildings at risk register to find compelling evidence of that. It is a sad and lengthy catalogue of neglected listed buildings, most of which are quietly decaying. We can schedule a monument, but that will not prevent its neglect. If anybody seeks evidence of that, they should visit Keil chapel in Duror, the last resting place of James of the Glen, who was wrongly hung for the Appin murder, which was the inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson&#8217;s international bestseller &#8220;Kidnapped&#8221;.

There are notable exceptions, but those countries have worked hard to create an equal society.</p><p>In Scotland, the areas where power is wielded are male dominated and, without action, that will continue, because like appoints like. People exercise the power that they wield in a way that reflects their own experience. Not deliberately but naturally we all make decisions based on our knowledge and experience. To redress the power imbalance, we need to be brave and take positive action.</p><p>We need to look at equal pay not just for the same job but for jobs requiring similar levels of skill and experience. I often compare the salaries of a police officer, which is a male-dominated career, and a nurse, which is a female-dominated career. Both careers require a public service ethos and the ability to care for and assist others, and both have in-built dangers that can be life threatening. One requires three to four years of university study and job-based training; the other requires 12 weeks of college-based training followed by 20 weeks as a probationer.</p><p>After training, the staff nurse who has studied for three or four years earns just over &#163;21,500 whereas the probationer police officer who has not finished their training earns over &#163;26,000 at 31 weeks. That is gender-based pay. The same thing happens more widely, as jobs that pay the minimum wage are often female-dominated occupations. We need to deal with gendered pay segregation and place equal value on the work that is carried out, regardless of the gender domination of the profession.</p><p>A child&#8217;s life chances depend on its mother&#8217;s education and pay. Only by lifting women out of poverty will we tackle child poverty. That comes at a cost, but so does the alternative. What is the cost of a child growing up in poverty&#8212;not only the cost to that child but the cost to wider society when that child becomes more dependent on services because its life chances have been curtailed, because its health has been damaged and because its own children are born into poverty? If we are serious about tackling child poverty, we must first tackle the mother&#8217;s poverty.</p><p>Sexual exploitation is also a result of gendered poverty and inequality. We can tackle sexual exploitation by giving women access to economic levers and equal pay. We can eradicate the desperation of poverty that pushes people into such exploitation. By creating a more equal society, we can make it unacceptable for people to be bought and sold because of their gender. To do that, we must have women in positions of power, and that will not happen naturally, because like appoints like. Because of that built-in imbalance, a built-in discrimination occurs. We see that in the lack of women in positions of power. We need positive discrimination to correct the imbalance in order that we can have equality going forward. It is difficult to take those steps because of vested interests. Most people would say that they believe in equality, but the reality is not so palatable if they are the one who is being asked to step aside to allow it to happen.</p><p>The Scottish Labour Party made proposals to have positive discrimination on public boards, but they were rejected by the Scottish Government, as Jenny Marra said. However, the Government has promised to do that if Scotland votes for separation. Surely that is an election bribe. People would have more confidence in the proposals had the Scottish Government not used its majority to vote down the proposals in the past. Today&#8217;s debate could have been about implementing the proposals. The Scottish Government could have said that, regardless of the result on 18 September, it will implement the policy on those boards on which it makes the appointments, taking leadership instead of passing the buck and engaging in constitutional wrangles. The Government will not do that. Actions speak louder than words. Does the Government believe that women are so gullible?</p><p>The Government has done the same with childcare but, in that case, it did not even bother to do the research or cost the policy properly. However, if we are to create opportunities for women, we need to make it easier for them to work. We need to provide affordable accessible childcare now. A pipe-dream promise is not good enough.</p><p>We must also share caring duties between the sexes. Men should have to share the responsibility for childcare, and both partners&#8217; employers should contribute to their employees&#8217; time off for childcare responsibilities.</p><p>Women who take career breaks to bring up children often struggle to catch up with the men in the workplace who have not had to do that. Were the role shared, it would provide equality in the workplace and create a more equal society.</p><p>We need to encourage women into male-dominated&#8212;and therefore more highly paid&#8212;professions, but we also need to value the professions and the careers pursued by women. Career choices are often hugely important to our society. Those choices include caring roles, such as looking after the young, the old and the unwell. We all depend on those roles. We have all been young, we all hope to be old and we will all experience ill health. However, we do not value the roles at all.</p><p>It is sad that we are still debating opportunities for women so many decades since the impact of inequality was recognised.

That is especially true in areas such as the one that I represent. In remote and rural areas where populations are much smaller, the benefits can be huge as festivals draw in visitors from other areas.</p><p>There are not just festivals, as such; there are county shows, highland games and agricultural shows. We can see the impact that the Royal Highland Show has on Edinburgh; up north we have the Black Isle show, which is our answer to the Royal Highland Show. It brings people in from the whole of the Highlands and Islands and beyond, and boosts the local economy.</p><p>We also have pipe band competitions&#8212;the world championships, for instance, which has unfortunately gone to Glasgow rather than Dunoon this year. That is a disappointment for the people in Dunoon&#8212;I hope that they will win the competition back, because it had a huge impact on the economy there.

Although I welcome those additional events, we need to be very careful about their impact on other events. I do not want to bring down the debate, which has been a great celebration of festivals, but in my area the RockNess music festival was cancelled this year because of competition from other events. That is unfortunate, because an awful lot of those events have been in the central belt rather than out in the more remote rural areas. RockNess was a prime music festival for young people, and losing it has had an impact on the economy not only of Inverness but of the south side of Loch Ness, which was very dependent on the festival.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>Sandra White makes a good point, but the problem was that, this year, the calendar was so packed that there was no opportunity to move the RockNess festival. I ask that, when we push forward and consider groundbreaking events, some thought be given to ensuring that we do not push out other events that have the ability to become annual and to have an impact on local communities. I ask for careful planning to ensure that an increased number of events does not impact on our more remote rural areas that cannot compete to the same extent.</p><p>We have wonderful festivals in the north. For example, the Hebridean Celtic festival&#8212;Hebceltfest&#8212;has been running for a number of years and has had a huge impact on the local economy. It attracts big names and spreads throughout the Western Isles with traditional and modern music. There is something for everybody. It happens not only in Stornoway but in community halls throughout the islands, allowing everybody to have an opportunity to attend and enjoy it.</p><p>I ask the cabinet secretary to have discussions with her colleagues about transport for such events. Events that happen on islands are very dependent on transport by boat. There are concerns in the Western Isles about the new MV Loch Seaforth. Many folk had hoped for two smaller boats that could have increased capacity during peak times to provide additional sailings and allow people to come and go. There are concerns that the one boat is dependent on the linkspan at Stornoway and Ullapool. If there was a problem with the linkspan in Stornoway, it could not be used at all to ferry people to the islands. I ask the cabinet secretary to raise that matter in discussions with her colleagues to ensure that there are contingency plans for such times. Last year, the boat from Scrabster to Orkney was cancelled for a number of weeks ahead of the Orkney folk festival and then bad weather ensued when folk went back on, leading to big pressure on all the sailings from Scrabster and Aberdeen and some people missing out on the festival because of the transport issues.</p><p>I will also mention Belladrum. I should, perhaps, register an interest to do with that because I was invited to perform&#8212;I say that because that is what it said on my wrist band&#8212;or, certainly, to speak at the verb garden tent there. Belladrum is very much a family festival with all kinds of different music. We see people of all age groups. Indeed, I saw wee cots on wheels that wheeled very young people around, especially in the evening when their parents were enjoying events.</p><p>Belladrum also has debates, conversations and discussions with experts and campaigners in the verb garden tent, which is interesting for a politician, who can go in and advance views and ideas. That is probably unique in all the festivals that we have throughout the country.</p><p>We also have other festivals throughout the area. Up Helly Aa is one, but there are many more&#8212;too many to mention in the debate.

Land reform is an issue that has moved up the political agenda in Scotland over the past couple of years, following a lot of action on the issue just before and directly after the Scottish Parliament was formed.</p><p>There is a danger that tonight&#8217;s debate could become a debate about the outcomes of the work of the land reform review group or the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill. I hope that we will have a lot of time to debate those specific matters over the coming weeks and months, but that is not the purpose of tonight&#8217;s debate. Tonight&#8217;s debate is relevant to those issues, but it sets them in an international context, in which we should also have an interest.</p><p>People assume that land ownership in Scotland is the same as land ownership elsewhere, but it is not. That is news to many Scots. Our land ownership patterns are massively out of kilter with those in the rest of Europe and those in most of the rest of the world. Most European countries took radical action to reform land ownership centuries ago.</p><p>The Bunchrew land declaration emanates from the Bunchrew seminar, at which a number of local and international interested parties joined together to explore land ownership issues. They heard Professor Jim Hunter, the writer and emeritus professor of history at the University of the Highlands and Islands, who is known and respected by many of us in the Parliament and beyond, give a paper. What was striking about the paper was the close parallels that it drew between our land history and what is happening to land ownership internationally today. At one point in his paper, Jim Hunter recounted the story of villagers in the Gambela region of Ethiopia being dispossessed of their land. That event mirrors uncannily events in Sutherland in the early 1800s.</p><p>What is happening today to many peoples across the globe, as powerful interests force them from their lands and deprive them of their principal means of existence, often with the connivance of their Government, is strikingly similar to aspects of our own history. We see the influence of that today in Scotland in the concentration of ownership of land, the concentration of power and influence and the increasing concentration of wealth that can come from land ownership.</p><p>From our history, we know of the actions of successive Governments, back to the end of the 19th century, on land reform, and despite that we are still debating land reform and the need for change today. We have over 150 years of legislation that tries to bring about change to land ownership patterns, yet we are still debating and trying to make decisive change. From our own experience, it is all too easy to see what faces the peoples in other parts of the world who are now fighting the land grab that is going on in their communities. They, too, face a future where the few will dominate the many, where a stake in the precious resource of land is limited or denied, and where power and wealth concentrate as a consequence of land ownership patterns. It must be right that we in Scotland show some solidarity with those peoples and that we learn from them today what their land reform actions are about and what is working best. It is therefore right that we offer to share with them our experience and insights, our policy and legislative actions and our thinking on the subject.</p><p>As Community Land Scotland has been discovering, our land debate is highly relevant to others, and their experience is relevant in helping us to confirm that our thinking is legitimate in the international context. The Bunchrew land declaration highlights those points. I hope that in his reply the minister will recognise that we in Scotland have something to offer in all this and that he will work with Community Land Scotland and others to build the links and dialogue that can help us and others. We sit firmly within an international context in which land reform is a necessary, just and common cause.</p><p>In commenting on the Bunchrew land declaration, Michael Taylor of the International Land Coalition, based in Rome, said:</p><p>&#8220;Like any country facing high concentrations of land ownership, challenging this structure also means challenging concentrations of economic and political power with which land ownership is so intertwined.&#8221;</p><p>Wherever we go, land reform struggles are always motivated by issues of social justice, greater fairness and how better to empower people.</p><p>I have heard too often from vested interests that the way in which land is owned and managed in Scotland currently is the best way in which to do it and that we should be very grateful to those wealthy private landowners for subsidising us all. The truth is very different. We are now discovering just how much the public purse subsidises many wealthy landowners&#8212;through beneficial tax breaks and large public grants&#8212;while they watch their land values soar. Meanwhile, few others have a stake in the land. The Bunchrew land declaration reminds us that there are other ways forward, which empower people to have a stake in their own land.</p><p>It simply cannot be right in a country that believes in greater fairness and social justice that just 432 people own half of Scotland&#8217;s private land. That reflects the concentration in very few hands of influence, power, and wealth. My motion congratulates Community Land Scotland on reinforcing for us, through its Bunchrew land declaration, the just cause of land reform in Scotland. I am encouraged by some of what has been emerging recently, but there is still a long way to go. I hope that in his reply the minister will build on the theme that he has been developing.

Her motion calls for the centenary of the Perth royal infirmary to be marked, and the debate does that. I am sure, however, that there will also be other local events to celebrate the centenary.</p><p>Perth royal infirmary is a district general hospital, which embraces new practice and delivers care as close as possible to patients. It is also often the receiving hospital for accidents on the A9, a route that is widely used by many of my constituents, so it provides those of us who live in the north, too, with life-saving interventions.</p><p>The infirmary provides traditional services as well as housing new developments, such as the Macmillan hospice, which provides palliative care close to home, family and loved ones. That is crucial in someone&#8217;s final days.</p><p>District general hospitals have a pivotal role to play in providing other interventions such as dialysis and oncology, which have already been mentioned. Those services need to be provided as locally as possible. They can be provided safely in district general hospitals, meaning that patients do not have to travel long distances for them&#8212;they allow patients to be closer to home and to their family. For those who need such interventions but are still able to work, there is much less disruption to their lives and their working day. We need to move as many services as we can to those hospitals, so that patients are treated as locally&#8212;but as safely&#8212;as possible.</p><p>E-health provides a tool that makes it possible to deliver complex treatments, such as chemotherapy, locally, and it gives direct access to back-up from highly skilled clinicians. I recently saw that myself in Oban hospital, which provides chemotherapy while being in touch with the consultants down in Glasgow. If any problems arise during treatment, those in Oban have immediate back-up, and it can work with that. Those are examples of things that we can put out to district general hospitals, which make a big difference.</p><p>I pay tribute to the staff at the Perth royal infirmary, who work hard to provide high-quality care. Like many in the NHS, they are struggling because of decreasing staffing numbers. They are facing some of the most challenging times that our health service has ever known. Nurses, medical staff and hospital staff in the NHS tell me that they have never known the health service to be struggling as much as it is today in the entirety of their careers. Indeed, the chair of the British Medical Association is now adding his voice to those concerns.</p><p>We in the Labour Party are asking for a review of the NHS&#8212;a Beveridge 21&#8212;to help us deal with those challenges. We owe it to all those who use and work in the NHS to have that review, so as to ensure that we deal with those issues.</p><p>We need to celebrate the Perth royal infirmary centenary and the contribution that has been made by hospital staff to patient care in the area. We need to recognise and build on the vital role of our district general hospitals in bringing services closer to patients. I am happy to join Liz Smith in celebrating the centenary.</p><p>I also wish to celebrate the actions of the suffragettes, who used the opening of the hospital to bring to the fore the need for women&#8217;s emancipation. I wonder what they would think of this debate this evening, in which three women have spoken, led by a woman and presided over by a woman. I think that they would be pretty chuffed to know that their actions on that day had borne fruit. Given that women are the backbone of the NHS, it is very appropriate that the suffragettes used the opening of the hospital to highlight the plight of women and their fight for equality.

They contribute the equivalent of around &#163;34 billion to our country. This is carers week, and it is really important that we take the opportunity to celebrate their contribution and thank them for it.</p><p>The debate should have been about the contribution of older people. At the weekend, we commemorated the D day landings, which reminded us all of the sacrifices that that generation made for the rest of us. Post-war, they faced a period of huge austerity, but what did they do in the face of that? They set up the welfare state and the NHS, selflessly determined to make the collective lot better. Hugh Henry talked about that and said that we owe them a debt of gratitude, which indeed we do. The labour and trade union movements have worked together to improve people&#8217;s lot and we benefit from that today. The debate should have been about their contribution, but many speeches have not touched on that at all, which is disappointing.</p><p>Labour has delivered and will continue to deliver for older people. Only a few of the things that we have achieved are mentioned in the Government motion. All that the SNP does is accuse us of having set up a cuts commission&#8212;that is a figment of its imagination&#8212;while it implements cuts here and now. It makes unfunded promises to older people while cutting services here and now. It is the elderly and the disabled who face a postcode lottery when it comes to the services that they receive and those that they must pay for. They are the new council tax payers, as a result of the stealth cuts that the Government has imposed.

We need to take on the challenge of how we pay for those services and not make the least well-off in our society pay for them, as the SNP is doing here and now. People are waiting on trolleys, getting seven-minute care visits and not being looked after as they should be, and that should be a source of shame to this Government.</p><p>I turn to the issue of free bus passes, which was mentioned by Nanette Milne, Ken Macintosh and Jim Hume, to name but a few. The point was made that people are less able to use them in rural areas, where there is no public transport, but that is not the case. A form of public transport is available in rural areas through the community transport schemes. Those schemes are not free, but they provide access to public transport and they are valued by older people.</p><p>The schemes are under threat right here and right now because of the Government&#8217;s stealth cuts, which are having an impact on our older people. Older people are being kept at home and prevented from socialising and getting out to do very basic things such as going to the doctor and doing their shopping. It is extremely important that the Government tackles the issue and funds those things, instead of implementing stealth cuts.</p><p>Other members talked about the health service and A and E. Jim Hume and Neil Findlay mentioned people lying on trolleys for hours on end without knowing when they will be seen, which is a disgrace, and issues such as bedblocking, which means that people are being boarded in wards and the like. Surely that is unacceptable in this day and age.</p><p>That is why we need a Beveridge-style review. NHS workers are telling me that they have never seen the NHS in such a bad state as the one that it is in now. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing has admitted that there are huge problems with the NHS, but all that he has said is that a review is not necessary, because he knows what the issues are. Let us see him start to address them, because people are confronting them now.</p><p>People accuse us of seeking to put the NHS on hold&#8212;that is not what we intend&#8212;but it is not on hold; it is actually in decline. The Labour Party appears to be the only party in the Parliament that can see that and which wants to address it. Tinkering at the edges is not enough; we need a Beveridge-style review to deal with the situation.</p><p>The debate should have been about the action plan, but not many members mentioned it. Those who did welcomed it. I think that we would all agree that it is a welcome document to have, but Ken Macintosh identified that something was missing from it&#8212;any mention of the role of kinship carers. We have a duty to ensure that older people who act as kinship carers are supported emotionally and financially in providing care for children and young people.</p><p>Neil Findlay pointed out that the Labour Party attempted to address the postcode lottery of financial support for kinship carers during consideration of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, but the Government voted down our proposal. In this country, some kinship carers are paid &#163;40 a week, some are paid &#163;200 a week, and some are paid nothing at all, which is an absolute disgrace. We need to support older people who perform that role. Because they are living off their pension and have no ability to increase their means, they are bringing up children in poverty, which has an impact on both children and carers.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch mentioned the need for young people to have access to older people. Because of generational change and families moving away, such access can be difficult to provide. She talked about initiatives in Germany that are helping younger people to have access to and learn from older people. It is important that that happens.</p><p>We need to plan to deal with the challenges of demographic change, but I do not see the Government doing that. We celebrate people living longer, but we must also plan for that, to ensure that people are able to lead worthwhile lives and are not left feeling afraid and excluded from society in old age, as happens to many, many people.</p><p>On the pension age and people living longer, I find it quite disgraceful that the Government seems to be saying that our early mortality rates are a cost-saving exercise about which we should be pleased, instead of apologising for its failure. That is not to do with independence; mortality rates in other parts of the UK are much better than ours.

Labour was swept to power in the Westminster landslide victory and it was committed to a step change in both foreign aid and debt relief.

She was passionate and committed to development, and she was very well served, I might say, by my friend George Foulkes, who was a very able deputy over the years at the Department for International Development.</p><p>The success and significance of those times can be measured by what was achieved. Between 1997 and 2010, the last Labour Government, as we have heard, trebled the UK&#8217;s aid budget and committed the UK to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income on official development assistance by 2013.

The bill was introduced on 30 October 2013, and stage 1 concluded with a parliamentary debate on 3 April 2014. The Local Government and Regeneration Committee considered the bill at stage 2 on 4 June, and today the Parliament debates whether to pass it. It is very much my hope that members will come together to welcome the bill and support it at decision time.</p><p>When I last stood in the chamber to talk about my member&#8217;s bill, it was known as the Defective and Dangerous Buildings (Recovery of Expenses) (Scotland) Bill. A lot has changed since stage 1, including the bill&#8217;s title, but I believe that change is good. My bill now delivers a more comprehensive approach to local authority debt recovery, encompassing not just local authorities&#8217; work in relation to defective or dangerous buildings under part 4 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003 but their work under part 3, in relation to compliance and enforcement.</p><p>An estimated &#163;4 million of debt has been accrued during the period for which charging orders have not been available to local authorities. As I explained in the stage 1 debate, prior to the 2003 act, local authorities relied on charging orders under the Building (Scotland) Act 1959 to tackle debt associated with dangerous buildings. However, when the 1959 act was repealed and replaced with the 2003 act, the charging order mechanism was not carried over, which left local authorities with an increasing debt burden that needs to be addressed now.</p><p>Local authority debt recovery can be problematic for myriad reasons. A couple of examples that were given in evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee at stage 1 demonstrate the diverse circumstances that can be encountered.</p><p>John Delamar, from Midlothian Council, talked about the</p><p>&#8220;deterioration of a chimney stack that is directly above a neighbouring single-storey property and above a public footpath right beside a bus stop&#8221;.</p><p>Because of the danger involved, there was a requirement for the local authority</p><p>&#8220;to fix the chimney by putting up scaffolding.&#8221;</p><p>He explained that the owner on the first floor of the property with the deteriorated chimney stack was &#8220;happy to pay&#8221;, whereas the person on the ground floor was not. He said to the committee:</p><p>&#8220;We are now in difficulties because the person on the ground floor, who had a business and other property, died, unfortunately. Therefore, we can no longer pursue the costs involved under our civil debt recovery methods.&#8221;</p><p>Gillian McCarney of East Renfrewshire Council told us about an example from her area. She said:</p><p>&#8220;We have a site with an absentee owner&#8212;I believe that he lives in Antigua. The council has incurred substantial costs in keeping the building safe. We understand that the owner is in discussions with several people to buy the site, and we have to continually check to see whether it has been sold.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 19 February 2014; c 3119.]</p><p>Both council officers noted the advantages that charging orders would have had in those situations&#8212;they would have helped them to recoup their expenses on the sale of the buildings concerned. I have no doubt that most councils will be able to recount cases in which charging orders would have made a difference.</p><p>Before I move on to discuss the main changes that were made at stage 2, I put on record my thanks to those who have helped to shape and develop the bill. In particular, I thank the Local Government and Regeneration Committee for its scrutiny of my policy, the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee for its continued scrutiny of the subordinate legislation powers and, of course, those who have worked diligently to support me prior to the bill&#8217;s introduction and through its parliamentary stages. I particularly thank Claire Menzies Smith from the non-Government bills unit and Neil Ross from the legal team for all the help and advice that they have provided. Last, but certainly not least, I express my gratitude for the assistance that I have received from the Minister for Local Government and Planning, Derek Mackay, and his officials.</p><p>When I set out on this journey, I very much doubted that my member&#8217;s bill would get beyond stage 1, let alone one day make it on to the statute book. I did not allow myself to believe that that would happen. I believe that it will now happen because politicians have decided to set aside their political differences to collectively address the problem of local authority debt recovery. Congratulations must therefore go not to me, but to the Parliament as a whole.</p><p>I want to focus on the main changes that arose from the stage 2 consideration. The bill was amended in three main areas: it was extended so that local authorities&#8217; actions would be encompassed under sections 25, 26 and 27 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, and it was amended to allow variation of the term of a changing order and to provide clarification of the liability of owners.</p><p>At the start of my speech, I referred to the change to the bill&#8217;s title. The reason behind that change represents one of the most significant changes to the bill. Local authorities have other enforcement powers under the 2003 act and, in some instances, they have to undertake work when an owner does not comply with notices that are served on them under those powers. Those powers relate to building regulations compliance notices under section 25 of the 2003 act; continuing requirement enforcement notices under section 26 of the 2003 act; and building warrant enforcement notices under section 27 of the 2003 act. The bill was extended to provide local authorities with greater certainty that they would be able to recover their costs in carrying out their duties under those sections of the 2003 act.</p><p>Action under those sections might not be as common as local authority action in relation to dangerous buildings, but it is no less important that local authorities have access to appropriate cost recovery tools when they have to step in to undertake work for compliance, enforcement or safety purposes.</p><p>The second area of change relates to the fixed 30-year repayment term. During stage 1, it became apparent that a number of local authorities had concerns about the fixed 30-year repayment term, particularly for lower sums. I readily acknowledged those concerns, so I brought forward a package of amendments to enable local authorities to determine the number of annual repayments that an owner must pay. The bill now provides for local authorities to determine the number of annual repayments, which must be no less than five and no more than 30. As well as addressing the point about the size of the debt, that change allows local authorities to take into account the debtor&#8217;s ability to pay.</p><p>The third area that I wish to touch on relates to the liability of owners. During stage 1, local authorities expressed concern that a property might be sold or its ownership transferred before a charging order could be registered, and they suggested that a notice of liability might help in that respect. On further investigation, it became clear that the crux of the problem related to timing. It should be possible for a local authority to register a charging order very soon after work has been carried out. Local authorities should not view charging orders as a tool of last resort, as they may have viewed them under the 1959 act; rather, they should be proactive in using them to secure the debt.</p><p>In conjunction with the Scottish Government, I looked into the possibility of the registration of a notice of potential liability in advance of a charging order but found that that would serve only to create a layer of bureaucracy that would detract from the simplicity of the bill. It would also have incurred additional costs for local authorities.</p><p>However, I recognised that liability might become an issue over the longer term as a property changed hands, which is why I lodged an amendment to clarify liability by ensuring that those who seek to avoid their responsibilities cannot. It provides that the buyer of a property, where a charging order has been registered, is to be severally liable with the seller for any unpaid amounts due by the seller under the charging order.</p><p>I will mention briefly the subordinate legislation powers. The Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee suggested that my bill should be amended to allow Scottish ministers to directly amend schedule 5A to the 2003 act to alter the form and content of a charging order, rather than leave the prospect of that being done by way of subordinate legislation. At stage 2, the Scottish Government decided to make use of existing powers under the 2003 act to prescribe the form and content of a charging order and a discharge. Therefore, my commitment to address the point has been somewhat overtaken, as it has been addressed by other means. I will leave it to the minister to explain the new subordinate legislation provision in section 1A.</p><p>The stage 2 process and today&#8217;s amending stage have been crucial to ensuring that the bill delivers an effective and modernised charging order mechanism for local authorities to recover from owners sums owed when local authorities have stepped in to carry out work under parts 3 and 4 of the 2003 act. Looking to the future and the bill&#8217;s implementation, I understand that the Scottish Government will be producing guidance to underpin the bill&#8217;s operation and that it will also prescribe the standard form and content of a charging order and a discharge to ensure consistency of operation across local authorities. The bill will come into force six months after royal assent.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the Buildings (Recovery of Expenses) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Buildings (Recovery of Expenses) (Scotland) Bill"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>I thank each and every member who has spoken in the debate. That is probably the first time that I have ever said those words in the Parliament over the past seven years, but I am very grateful for the personal support that I have been given and the support that has been acknowledged from the Minister for Local Government and Planning, the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee and every single member who has provided advice and support. Again, I flag up the help that I have received from the non-Government bills unit, the legal team and everyone else involved. Without that support, which is not available at Westminster, it would be impossible to achieve a successful member&#8217;s bill.</p><p>If we need one reason to pass the bill today, we have only to look back to what happened in Glasgow last week, when masonry from a sandstone building collapsed on to a street. That brings the bill into sharp focus. One of the bill&#8217;s main drivers is to provide local authorities with a greater assurance that they will recover their dangerous building costs. With that, I hope that councils will have more confidence to tackle high-level defective buildings or borderline dangerous buildings earlier&#8212;which will be less costly and will preserve the value and structure of properties&#8212;rather than have to deal with more dangerous buildings in the longer term.</p><p>I make no apologies for referring again to the statistics, which show that instances of action without notice under section 29 of the 2003 act&#8212;the most urgent action&#8212;more than doubled from 402 in 2010-11 to 992 in 2011-12. That clearly demonstrates the need for local authorities to have effective cost-recovery tools at their disposal.</p><p>Steering the bill through the Parliament has not been altogether straightforward. Ordinarily, financial issues cause some concern in relation to a member&#8217;s bill, but the bill achieves a lot for very little. It could be described as a bill that punches above its weight.</p><p>It was more the technical vagaries that made the process more difficult. Although I developed the bill on the basis of existing relevant statutory frameworks, local authorities&#8217; approach to debt recovery can vary. However, as a result of the parliamentary process and with the Scottish Government&#8217;s support, the bill does more than just recreate what went before in the 1959 act; it creates a modern version of a charging order that local authorities can use in their building compliance, enforcement and public safety work under the 2003 act.</p><p>Members have made excellent and informed speeches. I appreciated Derek Mackay&#8217;s positive comments and Sarah Boyack&#8217;s comments, given her background in planning, her knowledge of Edinburgh and the Lothians, her strong knowledge about the quality of the built environment and her understanding of the bill&#8217;s practical provisions.</p><p>I emphasise that the bill is not just about local authorities. Charging orders will be of great benefit to owners on a low income, such as those who are retired and are staying in a larger house after their family have left.</p><p>We all know that the debt across Scotland is running at about &#163;4 million, which is a horrendous sum.</p><p>I was bemused when my colleague Alex Johnstone&#8212;is he paying attention? [Interruption.] I was bemused when he talked about being uncontroversial and I wondered whether he was the same Alex Johnstone as I know. Nevertheless, he ended on a positive point about bringing the Parliament together. I share his view on the wider philosophical point. Kevin Stewart also made a statesmanlike comment about the spirit of co-operation. We can do more together.</p><p>Alex Rowley has great knowledge of local government from his experience in Fife. He gave good examples from that area and I praise the work that he has done not only as an MSP but as a prominent councillor for many years.</p><p>Roderick Campbell is a knowledgeable advocate who has a tremendous understanding of the issue. He referred to the tragic case of Christine Foster and I acknowledge the points that he made. I thank Anne McTaggart for her comments about standardisation across Scotland. That will be very important in the longer term.</p><p>I will quickly run through the advantages of charging orders, which are crucial. They add to the local authority cost-recovery toolkit to deal with large and small repayable amounts. They secure the debt over the property, which creates a priority for the debt that it would not have as an ordinary, unsecured debt.</p><p>A point that has not been made is that provision is included to recover expenses that are incurred over and above the basic cost of undertaking the work. Local authority administrative costs, registering and discharge fees and interest are all things that can be added to a charging order.</p><p>As the order is against the property, it avoids the need to pursue an individual in the civil courts. As members will know, that is not always successful and can be time consuming and expensive. It might also not be a viable option&#8212;that depends on the sums that are involved and being able to trace the owner, whether they are in Antigua or elsewhere.</p><p>A charging order provides a greater guarantee of the costs that are to be recovered. It enables a local authority to determine the number of annual instalments while&#8212;as Sarah Boyack said&#8212;taking into account the person&#8217;s ability to pay.</p><p>The bill will act as an incentive that will make those who are liable pay, rather than incurring the additional costs. The normal requirement to clear the charging order prior to the sale or transfer of the property will give an incentive for property owners to make payment of the outstanding sums to facilitate a sale.</p><p>The introduction of several liability means that an owner cannot avoid their responsibilities. It is likely to be much better to have had repairs carried out and a charging order placed, than for a property to fall into further disrepair, which is a problem not just for the owner, but for their neighbours and the value of property in the street in question.</p><p>Charging orders have an advantage in that their existence, and the sums to be charged, are easy to establish from the land register at the point of sale.</p><p>In conclusion, the bill is a first for the current session of the Parliament as it is the first Opposition member&#8217;s bill to reach this stage in the parliamentary process. A fair wind at decision time will mean that it is a first for me too, as I have attempted on a few occasions, as an MP at Westminster and as an MSP here, to promote a member&#8217;s bill.</p><p>With great pleasure, I commend to the Parliament the Buildings (Recovery of Expenses) (Scotland) Bill.

As we heard earlier from Mark McDonald, Professor John Macleod from Aberdeen discovered insulin in 1922.</p><p>I would like to focus on the health implications of the life sciences, with particular reference to diabetes, as I am co-convener of the cross-party group on diabetes.</p><p>The debate is important, as the life sciences industry is innovative, dynamic and growing faster than the economy as a whole. There are, of course, major implications for improvements to quality of life and for step changes in health, agriculture and medicine.</p><p>As we have already heard, the industry is highly integrated in the UK. It has a track record that goes back over 40 years and the UK hub of life sciences is one of the most successful hubs globally.</p><p>One of the largest life science operations in Scotland is LifeScan Scotland in Inverness, which is a Johnson and Johnson company. The original company was set up in 1995 to design and manufacture glucose test strips and to design electronic meters for the global diabetes market. More than 1,000 highly skilled and talented staff are employed at the Inverness facility, which I had the pleasure of visiting a few short months ago. It is highly regarded as a centre of excellence for those working in the field of diabetes.</p><p>With a focus on future development, LifeScan Scotland is committed to</p><p>&#8220;Creating a world without limits for people with diabetes.&#8221;</p><p>LifeScan Scotland&#8217;s main product range includes the popular OneTouch brand of blood glucose monitoring systems, which are available globally. The company has also developed diabetes management software, control solutions and lancing devices; in addition, it produces the specialist test strips that work with many of the meters in the OneTouch brand line.</p><p>The original company started with just a handful of employees and it is now one of the largest private sector employers in the Highlands and Islands. It gives a snapshot of the growth potential of the life science industry in Scotland.</p><p>It is also important to note that the company funds a senior academic post in the University of the Highlands and Islands in the shape of Professor Ian Megson. That is a good example of the excellent collaboration between industry and the academic community.</p><p>Life science research does not mean obscure, little-read academic tomes; it means real step changes in quality of life for patients. Last year, for example, life science researcher Dr Roman Hovorka created a historic diabetes landmark by developing home use of the artificial pancreas. That step offers real hope of a future in which people with type 1 diabetes no longer have to monitor blood glucose levels and have a better chance of living a long and healthier life. The artificial pancreas is a closed-loop system that monitors blood glucose levels and uses the information to adjust the amount of insulin being administered by an insulin pump, which ensures that the person always gets the right amount.</p><p>Life science researchers have talked about the idea for a long time, but they have had to proceed with the system cautiously: having too much or too little insulin is potentially harmful, so malfunctions of the technology must be avoided. However, in 2011, researchers completed a trial in which people with type 1 diabetes used the artificial pancreas in a hospital setting, which cleared the way for a new trial of the prototype device at home.</p><p>As we heard earlier, Scotland punches above its weight in research, securing &#163;247 million in research council grants, which is 13.1 per cent of the total, and gaining 13 per cent of the &#8364;1.1 billion UK charities research pot.</p><p>Life sciences do very well out of such funds, and as the Skills Development Scotland report highlights:</p><p>&#8220;The university sector also plays an important role as an employer: life sciences account for 55% of total Scottish University research funding, attracting 15% of UK academic bioscience research funding.&#8221;</p><p>In my region of the Highland and Islands, Highlands and Islands Enterprise has recently provided &#163;3 million funding for a life sciences unit that will be part of the new Inverness campus. The whole project could support 6,000 jobs over the next 30 years and generate about &#163;38 million for the regional economy. That type of investment is vital to provide the facilities needed for the life science sector and to ensure that training and skills development are available to young people so that they can exploit the job opportunities that the sector will offer in future.</p><p>Life science is an exciting industry. There has been breathtaking and groundbreaking work on diabetes and regenerative medicine. There has been a convergence of digital and healthcare technology. The future will present demands for skills development.</p><p>More widely, there are huge barriers to entry. For example, it takes an average of $1 billion and 20 years to develop new drugs.

That has been echoed by poets, including Robbie Burns, because birds and bees are the things that keep our humanity and our world going.</p><p>The role of pollinators to the economy and environment is vital and makes the decline of a broad variety of pollinators a matter of huge concern. I congratulate Angus MacDonald on bringing such an important topic to the Parliament.</p><p>I am proud to declare that I am a species champion for the marsh fritillary butterfly, which unfortunately has been in decline for the past 150 years due to loss of habitat and parasites. That is only one of the many examples of pollinators whose existence is under severe threat.</p><p>Pollinators such as honey bees and bumblebees play a key role in the majority of ecosystems. They are essential for parts of our agricultural economy. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that of the 100 crop species that provide 90 per cent of all food worldwide, 71 are animal pollinated. The number for Europe is even higher, at 84 per cent, valued at &#163;12.6 billion per year. The production value of pollinator-dependent crops is roughly five times higher than that of crops that are not dependent on insects. That shows our reliance on pollinators, thus making the decline of those species a matter of huge concern. Governments should have a plan bee.</p><p>Although it is hard to determine accurately the precise economic benefit that pollinators provide, they have a very significant impact. Their role in the commercial production of soft fruit, such as raspberries and blackberries, as well as oilseed rape, to mention just a few, cannot be overestimated.</p><p>Unfortunately, the trend in Scotland is clear: the abundance of pollinators has gradually declined over the past 50 years. That has especially been the case for bumblebees, which are the only pollinator of potato flowers in the world. Scotland&#8217;s potato crop is estimated to be worth &#163;160 million, so the decline of a staggering 60 per cent in the abundance of bumblebees must be very concerning for us.</p><p>Other reasons for the decline involve the destruction and fragmentation of natural habitat. The European Union demands that all farmers set aside 5 per cent of their land for &#8220;greening&#8221;, which falls under the first pillar of the common agricultural policy. It is important that a compromise is found that ensures that there is enough natural habitat for our pollinators to not only survive but flourish, while ensuring the sustainability and successes of our agricultural production.</p><p>The sources of decline are many and diverse, as well as differing between different species of pollinators. Other invasive species, such as parasitic mites, are in themselves a major threat to apiculture; they also spread a number of diseases. They have decimated honey bee colonies across the world, from the middle east and Japan to Europe and the US, where up to 85 per cent of colonies have been wiped out due to mites or diseases spread by them.</p><p>It is important to find the balance between environmental interests and commercial interests, but it is clear that we must take urgent action to avoid widespread environmental and economic implications. We must take heed of this warning, which is like the canary in the coalmine.</p><p>On a note of perhaps slight optimism, my local pharmacist told me that there has been an explosion in the number of stings by bees and wasps this summer. So, if we get stung, we must remember to be thankful for small mercies and for small things.</p><p>I will conclude with a quote from the United Nations Environment Programme:</p><p>&#8220;The health and well-being of pollinating insects are crucial to life, be it in sustaining natural habitats or contributing to local and global economies.&#8221;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Pollinator Population"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p></p><p>1.

We recognise that many of those who come to Britain seeking asylum have suffered terrifying experiences and have made a huge effort to reach our borders, and we should, as the minister has said, treat those people as all modern liberal democracies treat them, with compassion, dignity and respect. There is no argument about that, and I think that most people believe that individual and collective freedom within the rule of law is the basis of our democracy.</p><p>The key to dealing with asylum seekers who arrive in this country is having a system of assessment that is efficient, robust and transparent, processes cases as quickly as possible and, above all, is fair. That is fundamental so that we can then offer the appropriate support to genuine asylum seekers and refugees. We need to recognise that some of the people who come to the country seeking asylum may not be genuine but want to come here for other reasons including economic ones. In the interests of the genuine asylum seekers, therefore, those people must be removed from the country as smoothly as possible, and we support the UK Government in taking all the necessary steps to remove those who have no valid grounds to stay here.</p><p>The UK coalition Government inherited an asylum system that many described as chaotic and dysfunctional with a massive backlog of cases, but it is making steady progress in putting that right. The UK takes a positive role in working with fellow European Union member states to ensure that asylum flows are properly managed and that those who are in genuine need of protection are given it without undue delay, while those who do not need protection are swiftly refused asylum and returned to their own countries.</p><p>The detention of children of asylum seekers has been debated in this Parliament before. I spoke in a debate on the subject in 2009. I am delighted that the UK coalition has made real progress in that area as it has sought to ensure that the welfare of children is promoted. It ended the detention of children at Dungavel as soon as it was elected in 2010. Home Office policy is clear that family detention is used only as a last resort in the removal of failed asylum seekers from the UK after all voluntary returns options have failed, and an independent family returns panel is consulted prior to every enforced return.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers and Refugees"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>If that is really the case, I will have to come back to the minister at another time with an answer to that.

Indeed, I have voiced concerns about that myself. Again, we would want to see such raids used only as a last resort. However, where a family has chosen to break the law and defy the decisions of UK courts, we have to allow the agencies time and space to carry out operations to rectify that situation and ensure compliance with our laws. The timing of such operations will depend on a number of factors including the safety of the family and others and any concerns that the police and others raise around public order.</p><p>On the issue of allowing asylum seekers to work, the UK Government is clear that the purpose of the current policy is to deter economic migration through the asylum route. Economic migration comes through other routes.</p><p>On the level of financial benefits that are provided to asylum seekers in the UK in addition to the free accommodation and utilities that are provided by the Government, I am aware of the recent court ruling on the subject, and the Home Office is considering a range of options. Again, it wants to avoid doing anything that might encourage economic migration through asylum. Those who are granted refugee status can, of course, access welfare benefits and tax credits just as UK nationals can, as well as entering the labour market.</p><p>I pay tribute to those charities in Scotland that work with genuine asylum seekers and refugees.

Its analysis concludes that, rather than 104,000 women coming back into work, there are 64,000 women in that group who are economically inactive, of whom 14,000 would like to work. The SPICe briefing confirms that the Scottish Government figures have been exaggerated by 90,000.</p><p>Childcare is a devolved issue.

The point that is worth recognising is that the Scottish Government&#8217;s figures have not been modelled and the SPICe briefing figures have. SPICe has done a proper economic analysis, and I rest my case on those figures.</p><p>The figures that were released earlier this month on female participation in the Scottish and United Kingdom markets are very encouraging, with the unemployment rate down to 6.4 per cent for both and the employment rate up for both, as well as a reduction in the number of economically inactive women. All the indicators are moving in the right direction but, as I said earlier, there is still more to do.</p><p>To me, the issue is not just about getting women into work; it is about giving women the full career training and educational opportunities to make sure that their time at work pays and that career opportunities are open to them. I agree with the cabinet secretary&#8217;s point that it is about ensuring that work is well rewarded.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s record on women is well documented in the Colleges Scotland briefing paper for the debate. It states that, since the SNP came to power in 2007, there has been a small increase of 4,500 women in full-time courses in further education, which is welcome. That is against a background of a fall of 100,544 women in part-time courses.

As Councillor Harry McGuigan of COSLA told the committee,</p><p>&#8220;the devil is ... in the detail.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 6 May 2014; c 4110.]</p><p>There are various issues that still require to be addressed, many of which have been raised today. Perhaps the most significant of those issues revolves around how we ensure that local decision making is preserved&#8212;a point raised by Liam McArthur and one that was put to us firmly by people across Orkney. Although there are good reasons for designating historic environment Scotland as the sector&#8217;s lead body, we must ensure that that new entity advises in a manner that preserves and, we hope, strengthens local decision making. That point, which relates to local government, was made very clear to us on our visit to Orkney.</p><p>Any shift towards greater centralisation would be to the detriment of the historic environment. Although I note the assurances that the cabinet secretary has given in this area, it would seem to be sensible to make those intentions more explicit, perhaps in accompanying guidance.</p><p>Then there is the relationship with the private sector. It is fair to say that, on the whole, Historic Scotland has enjoyed a very good working relationship with the private heritage sector, which we hope will continue. We should recognise that private owners have a huge stake in Scotland&#8217;s historic environment, especially as they meet restoration costs from their own pockets.</p><p>On the broader point about ministerial direction, although all non-departmental public bodies must have a working relationship with central Government, section 12 of the bill reads rather broadly. Particular concerns have been raised about curatorial independence. Liz Smith raised exactly that issue earlier and I associate myself with her remarks. Put simply, it would not be acceptable for the Scottish Government to exert a higher degree of control over historic environment Scotland, so further assurances about how any difference of opinion would be resolved would be very helpful as we take the bill forward.</p><p>Another area of contention relates to funding. I noted with interest the figures that the National Trust for Scotland and the Historic Houses Association for Scotland supplied to the committee about their property maintenance backlogs, which, when added together, amounted to more than &#163;100 million. Unfortunately, comparable figures for historic environment Scotland will not be available until next April.</p><p>As Stewart Maxwell, the convener of the committee, said in his opening remarks, it is important that the Scottish Government confirms who will ultimately be responsible for meeting the property maintenance for the significant 345 properties in care. Whoever that may be and whatever the final total, it seems that the new body will have to raise significant levels of additional finance. There is some concern that that could clash with the broader regulatory role that historic environment Scotland must have at its core.</p><p>My final point relates to accountability. Although &#8220;Our Place in Time&#8221; commands the wide support of the sector, as things stand we have no indication of who will be tasked with ensuring that outcomes are met. I whole-heartedly agree that emphasis should be placed on collaboration&#8212;I think that we all do&#8212;but if those outcomes are to be realised, we need direct lines of accountability.</p><p>All those points can be resolved as the bill continues its progression, of course. Fundamentally, the rationale for the merger is sound, and the strategy is an important document that should go a long way to strengthening the sector.</p><p>For those reasons, we welcome the stage 1 report.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-06-12", "body": "<p>I thank Elaine Smith for securing the debate and setting out so many of the benefits of breastfeeding. As members said, Elaine has been a long-term ambassador for breastfeeding. I remember nagging my daughter to breastfeed her first child, who was born in 2001, when the Parliament was meeting up the road, and proudly reporting back to Elaine that my daughter had breastfed for several months.</p><p>Cara Hilton&#8217;s experience reminded me of when my children were born in Dundee royal infirmary, around 40 years ago. I was the only mum to breastfeed on a Florence Nightingale-type ward of nearly 30 women. It was interesting to learn how little has changed.</p><p>Like other members, I condemn the action that was taken against Emily Slough in Staffordshire, when a photograph was taken without her permission and placed on a social networking site, where it attracted disrespectful comments. I am not sure whether the incident would have been in breach of the Breastfeeding etc (Scotland) Act 2005. Perhaps the minister will make that clear. As the motion says, the 2005 act</p><p>&#8220;makes it illegal to stop, or attempt to stop, mothers breastfeeding in public&#8221;.</p><p>What happened to Emily Slough was certainly in breach of the tone and intention of the 2005 act, which were about reassuring mothers and helping breastfeeding in public to become a social norm.</p><p>Elaine Smith talked about the 2005 act, but, as is so often the case, the issue is not the legislation, which is fine, but how the legislation is enforced and implemented. That is what really matters.</p><p>The benefits of breastfeeding to babies and mothers have been well stated by all speakers, and they range from protecting babies from common childhood diseases to helping mothers to return to their pre-pregnancy weight, as Elaine Murray said. One of the most important benefits must be the convenience&#8212;there are no bottles to be sterilised and there is a constant supply.</p><p>I am a strong advocate of breastfeeding, but I am aware that many mothers want to breastfeed but find it difficult. We need to recognise that.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Breastfeeding"}, {"date": "2014-06-12", "body": "<p>I absolutely do&#8212;I could not agree more. Quite often, it is about freeing up a bed in hospital. I do not expect mothers to have to stay in for four days, as Cara Hilton did; they could be given help and support at home. I whole-heartedly agree that support is vital.</p><p>It is interesting to note that older mothers are more likely to breastfeed than young mothers. In 2012-13 in Scotland, I was surprised to see that only 5 per cent of mothers aged under 20 breastfed their babies at six to eight weeks compared with 34 per cent of mothers aged 40 and over. The main statistic to note is that 41 per cent of mothers in the least deprived areas were exclusively breastfeeding at six to eight weeks, a figure that is three times greater than that for mothers in the most deprived areas. When we consider the cost of infant formula, that is undoubtedly an area in which, as Elaine Smith said, more support, awareness and help could be given.</p><p>Scotland still compares favourably with Wales and Northern Ireland on breastfeeding, and we are only 2 per cent behind England in the figures for exclusive breastfeeding at six weeks. However, we can do better.</p><p>I commend Elaine Smith for bringing the debate to Parliament and for helping us all to raise awareness of breastfeeding. There is no doubt of the health benefits to baby and mother. It should also not be lost that there are savings to the public purse and families, particularly those from the most deprived backgrounds.</p><p>More can be done to encourage and support more women to breastfeed and to make breastfeeding in public the social norm, as Jayne Baxter said. I do hope that this debate will go some way towards helping to achieve that.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Breastfeeding"}, {"date": "2014-06-04", "body": "<p>I, too, thank Claire Baker for securing the debate. This debate exemplifies what members&#8217; debates should be about. I thank her very much for bringing the issue to Parliament.</p><p>Growing up in Angus, we never spoke about &#8220;potatoes&#8221;&#8212;that was for the toffs&#8212;but about &#8220;tatties&#8221;. They were part of our annual calendar of events. From when I was eight years old, I would be sowing tatties in the spring, then we had the three-week tattie holiday in October. Between those times, we were out picking daffodils at Dykelands and picking strawberries and raspberries at Charleton, near Montrose, in the summer holidays. It probably sounds like child slave labour these days, but it was just a normal part of our lives.</p><p>Growing up in Montrose, I was aware of the excellent disease-free seed potatoes that are grown in Scotland and exported to many countries, so it is no surprise to hear that overseas demand for seed potatoes has risen by 30 per cent in the past 10 years. However, I have to say that, probably like many people&#8212;I make no apology for it&#8212;I was not fully aware of the nutritional benefits of potatoes. I was probably not very aware at all of that until I started researching for this debate. It is perhaps lack of knowledge about those benefits that has been responsible for some of the decline of 500,000 tonnes in the potato crop between 2011 and 2013. To me, that seems to be a huge amount.</p><p>I also have to confess that the year of the potato 2008 passed me by, so I cannot say that I learned much about the potato that year. However, the briefing from the Potato Council states that in 2008 the Scottish Government published a target, which Claire Baker mentioned, of increasing potato consumption by 25 per cent, which was in &#8220;Healthy Eating, Active Living: An action plan to improve diet, increase physical activity and tackle obesity (2008-2011)&#8221;. The action plan was set to run for three years. Unfortunately, the Potato Council&#8217;s briefing states:</p><p>&#8220;Subsequent policy documents have been inconsistent in referencing this target.&#8221;</p><p>I hope that the debate goes some way to addressing that. However, with reference to the goal of increasing potato consumption by 25 per cent, Michael Matheson stated that</p><p>&#8220;there is no evidence base regarding the health benefits of consuming potatoes specifically&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Written Answers, 27 November 2013; S4W-18389.]</p><p>Well, I have to say that I found plenty such evidence. We have heard plenty of it in the debate and there are plenty more sources.</p><p>As Claire Baker said, Scotland is the right place for growing potatoes because the amount of water that is used for the process here is just 29 per cent of the global average for the process. It uses 133 times less water than rice growing and it results in 42 per cent less greenhouse gas emissions than producing pasta does. On the health and nutrition front, a medium potato provides 45 per cent of the daily required amount of vitamin C&#8212;I certainly did not know that&#8212;more potassium than bananas, spinach or broccoli and 10 per cent of the daily required amount of vitamin B6. All of that is done for 110 calories with no fat, sodium or cholesterol. If I did not know that, how many other people out there do not know it?</p><p>Potatoes are fat free and are lower in calories than white rice and pasta; they have almost half the calories of the same amount of white rice and significantly fewer calories than boiled white pasta. In terms of fibre, the potato yields double the amount of fibre that is in pasta and more than 20 times that which is found in boiled white rice. The potato is a superfood, by any other name.</p><p>Claire Baker referred to rising food prices, and price is a factor with potatoes, given that products such as pasta and rice can act as very acceptable substitutes for potatoes. I find it worrying that ware potatoes have increased in price from &#163;100 per tonne in 2011 to &#163;270 per tonne in 2012. I hope that that price increase will encourage farmers and other growers to allocate more land to the production of potatoes, given the financial incentive to do so.</p><p>I have found the factual information surrounding the debate very interesting. I will be sure to include tatties in my weekly shop from now on. I hope that the debate has raised awareness about the nutritional and health benefits of the potato.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Potatoes"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p></p><p>8.

They were not the only ones, but it is important that this debate has been conducted in such a manner.</p><p>I also acknowledge the agreement that we have seen from across the chamber. We might have our differences in the lead-up to 18 September, but we all agree on the contribution to Scotland of EU and international students. My daughter went to Leiden for a year as part of the Erasmus scheme to study for her degree, and I know how much she benefited from that and from meeting other students.</p><p>Like my colleague Liz Smith, I welcome the chance to debate immigration policy today. Although I completely understand why Universities Scotland and individual principals such as Anton Muscatelli, who has had many mentions today, have raised concerns about the UK Government&#8217;s immigration policy, as the Conservative amendment makes clear, and as Liz Smith did very well to set out, it is vital to place the debate in context.</p><p>Specifically, the previous student visa system had to be looked at. I can do no better than to quote the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, the former Labour minister Margaret Hodge, who concluded that the 2009 changes were</p><p>&#8220;poorly planned and ill-thought out&#8221;</p><p>and that they were implemented</p><p>&#8220;before proper controls were in place&#8221;.</p><p>The result was that an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 additional migrants came to the UK to work rather than to study. A &#8220;Newsnight&#8221; investigation, as well as that of &#8220;Panorama&#8221; of course, was able to obtain two bogus visa documents for &#163;350.</p><p>Since being elected, the UK coalition Government has sought to address the situation. The measures that it has taken are too numerous to mention, so I will mention just two or three. All institutions that want to sponsor students now have to be classed as &#8220;highly trusted&#8221; and be accredited by statutory education inspection bodies, and rightly so. We owe it to the students who come here. There has been a shift away from paper visa applications, which were being abused, towards online, print-and-send application forms. Credibility interviews have been established that also assess those who apply to study in the UK.</p><p>I appreciate that there were no bogus colleges in Scotland, but they undoubtedly existed elsewhere in these islands. Given the huge problems with the old system, the changes were necessary. No one could argue that they were not, and I thank Neil Bibby for acknowledging that in his opening remarks.</p><p>The vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia said that the UK Government</p><p>&#8220;listened to our concerns about pathway courses into universities and the need for the language requirement to be set at a realistic level that will not deter good students&#8221;.</p><p>Accordingly, for an immigration system to function properly, it must welcome those who are willing to contribute to society while acting against those who seek to exploit the system.</p><p>As Liam McArthur said, a recent poll identified that seven out of 10 Scots believe that stricter controls on immigration are necessary. Whatever we think about such opinions, we cannot simply wish them away.</p><p>Leaving aside all the uncertainties that surround the SNP&#8217;s own immigration proposals, the facts state that since the UK Government came to power, the number of first-year enrolments from non-EU countries to Scottish universities has increased year on year, as Kezia Dugdale said. We all thoroughly welcome the contribution of the students who have come here to study.</p><p>Although there has been a drop in the number of Indian students coming to Scotland, the numbers from China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Thailand and many other countries continue to rise year on year. If we want to talk about India, let us do so in context.</p><p>Like others, I believe that international students make a huge contribution to Scottish life, educationally, economically and of course culturally. I sympathise with and acknowledge the concerns voiced by Universities Scotland and Professor Pete Downes, who recently appeared before the Education and Culture Committee. As I have said, we want to welcome students, but we do not want people coming in with bogus visas, which is detrimental to those who want to come here to contribute to Scottish life. We want to discourage those who exploit and abuse the system. The UK Government had to tackle the student visa system, which was coming in for abuse, and those measures must be set in context.</p><p>The discrimination&#8212;and it is discrimination&#8212;against English students that would happen if we went forward to an independent Scotland is unacceptable. In the context of any attempt to maintain good relations with our nearest neighbours, that has to the worst possible policy. Clare Adamson stands on the moral high ground and talks about how she opposes &#163;9,000 tuition fees, but she is very happy to take the &#163;9,000 tuition fees from those who are coming from England. If she is opposed to &#163;9,000 tuition fees, why is she so happy to charge English students that amount if an independent Scotland were to come?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Immigration Policy (Higher Education)"}, {"date": "2014-05-28", "body": "<p>It was a bit rich for the minister to tell the Labour Party to listen and learn when the Government is debating its white paper flagship policy today with a huge absence from the SNP ranks. [Interruption.] I see that Mr Russell is laughing, but it is his party&#8217;s flagship policy.</p><p>I am glad that the Labour Party has selected childcare for debate this afternoon. As all parties in the chamber recognise, we must go further in terms of the hours that are provided, and we must extend eligibility. One concern is the issue of birthday discrimination, which my colleague Liz Smith will come back to in her speech.</p><p>Recently in the Education and Culture Committee, we heard evidence on Scotland&#8217;s educational and cultural future, with regard to the Government&#8217;s white paper. During the final evidence session, we discussed childcare&#8212;rightly so&#8212;with the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning. Mr Russell gave a typically modest performance, which included the following statement. He said:</p><p>&#8220;It is wrong to try to deconstruct it&#8221;</p><p>&#8212;the white paper&#8217;s childcare policy&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;and undermine it by taking a figure from here and a figure from there and saying, &#8216;You hivnae worked this out.&#8217;&#8221; &#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 29 April 2014; c 4098.]</p><p>That was quite an extraordinary statement. To question the financial assumptions behind the policy is an exercise not of deconstruction, but of parliamentary scrutiny.</p><p>As the Labour motion makes clear, the Scottish Parliament information centre recently published a full and rather devastating brief on the white paper plans. Is SPICe, too, guilty of deconstruction?</p><p>Perhaps I could go a step further and ask whether freedom of speech is no longer accepted by this Government.</p><p>Secondly, there are very good reasons to conclude that the Scottish Government has not got its sums right on the policy&#8212;notwithstanding the fact that the projected 6 per cent rise in female employment is purely illustrative, as the journalist Tom Gordon and many others have pointed out, and is in no way related to the specific proposals that are outlined in the white paper.</p><p>As other members have mentioned today, in order for female employment to reach Swedish levels, 104,000 currently inactive mothers would have to enter the workforce. As SPICe has concluded, there are 64,000 women in that category at present, and only 14,000 indicated that they would enter employment. Economic modelling for the policy cannot have been done, or we would not be here today debating the issue and asking for information. That is a crucial point because, as the cabinet secretary said to the committee, the childcare policy&#8212;in particular the third phase of the plan&#8212;will be funded via taxation.</p><p>If there are not enough women who are able&#8212;or, indeed, willing&#8212;to enter the workforce, that raises questions about the proposal&#8217;s affordability. SPICe has estimated that the third phase would cost &#163;1.2&#160;billion, which could rise to &#163;1.5&#160;billion if costs continue to grow. It is estimated that, in order to generate that kind of figure from increased workforce taxation alone, we would need a 10 per cent rise in employment rates, which is an extremely substantial advance in what would be a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>A further point relates to the nature of the work that it is anticipated those mothers will do. Kezia Dugdale raised that issue, too. In a press release that was issued the day after the white paper was published, the Scottish Government indicated that the projected 35,000 additional childcare jobs will be &#8220;mainly for women&#8221;. We all know&#8212;in my case, I know from my family&#8217;s experience&#8212;that people who work in the nursery sector are low paid. Most of them are on the minimum wage and many are on zero-hours contracts. They are much more highly trained and qualified than they were a decade ago, and are all registered with the Scottish Social Services Council. In a debate such as this, we should all put on the record how much we value everyone who works in childcare.</p><p>It is not just about education. The great thing about childcare is that it offers the chance to identify children&#8217;s development needs at the earliest stage, so that they can be addressed pre-school rather than later.</p><p>I very much welcome Professor Siraj&#8217;s review of the early years workforce. However, unless conditions are radically altered, many part-time workers within the sector will not earn enough to go beyond the personal allowance. Since the coalition government came to power, the personal allowance has increased year on year and is now more than &#163;10,000.

I will focus on Edinburgh and the importance of our festivals to our culture and economy. The Edinburgh international festival was established in 1947, in the wake of the second world war. Its founders believed that the festival should</p><p>&#8220;enliven and enrich the cultural life of Europe, Britain and Scotland&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;provide a platform for the flowering of the human spirit&#8221;.</p><p>That ethos is alive and well today. Sixty years on, the Edinburgh international festival is as exciting and challenging as ever. However, the world has changed and many other cities, jealous of Edinburgh&#8217;s success, are keen to emulate our international festival and generate the economic and cultural benefits that come from such a flagship event.</p><p>We have had only nine directors of the festival since 1947, and it is appropriate to acknowledge the work that Jonathan Mills has done. It is a significant commitment that someone makes when they become the director of the Edinburgh international festival, but it is a magnificent, unrepeatable experience for a person. Over the years, the festival has grown&#8212;and this is what I want to focus on&#8212;into a series of nearly year-round events. Festivals Edinburgh alone is comprised of 11 different annual festivals, each of which adds something special to the life of the city. Each of those festivals is important on its own terms, whether social, artistic, scientific or economic.</p><p>The &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; report, which was published in 2006, was commissioned to address the fact that other cities were beginning to get their act together, and that other festivals and big cultural and sporting events were being held around the globe. &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; has been hugely important for all the various stakeholders and everyone who is involved in the festivals. The construction of the forum has been hugely important, too. As well as enabling us to have strategic co-ordination and strategic discussion of all our festivals, and some sense of collective interest in them, it has been crucial in looking at the challenges that exist and thinking about what needs to be done.</p><p>Given that a refreshed version of the &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; report will be produced next spring, I want us to think about progress on investment and leadership, not just for the international festival but for all the festivals. We need to consider who comes next, who the next performers will be, how the productions are managed and what investment is taking place in research and development and, crucially, programming. The nuts and bolts of the festival need investment. We see the stars and the globally successful people who give the festival a face, but all the work that is done underneath the brilliant surface needs to be invested in if Edinburgh is to retain its pre-eminence as a festival city.</p><p>I highlight the issue of support for artists in the future. At the moment, there are simply not enough places for artists to develop their skills, their crafts or their arts. We have one or two hugely important venues in the city, such as St Margaret&#8217;s house and Wasps studios, but there are not enough spaces available to meet the demand that exists in the city among artists who are drawn to Edinburgh and those who grew up here.</p><p>In addition, we need a lot more investment in venues. Over the year, the City of Edinburgh Council has had to make some extremely tough decisions and has not been able to invest in as many venues as it would have liked as quickly as it would have liked. Major venues still need more investment, including the King&#8217;s Theatre and the Queen&#8217;s Hall. Although our venues are expensive, they are hugely important from the point of view of the character of the festival. The Edinburgh Filmhouse has aspirations for the future, too, and it needs investment.</p><p>A key suggestion in the &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; report was about the need for the Scottish Government to continue its support. That is essential. Many of the initiatives that the cabinet secretary mentioned are crucial to the long-term success of the festivals. I am referring to investment in galleries such as the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, in the National Museum of Scotland and in the work of Creative Scotland. Those institutions are important because they all underpin the capacity to put on the international festival. Without that national investment, the international festival just would not exist in its current form, nor would the fringe or the range of other festivals that we have.</p><p>I add a plea for support for contemporary music. We have recently lost the Picture House on Lothian Road, which was a hugely important all-year-round venue, and we do not have a replacement in the city.</p><p>&#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221; also made some extremely difficult recommendations. It recommended that, as a start, the City of Edinburgh Council should increase its cultural spend from 2.8 to 4 per cent of the budget, but it had aspirations for a much bigger increase than that. As the report noted, Edinburgh faces the challenge of having a relatively small tax base to draw on compared with competitor cities. The city is actually quite small. In population terms, it doubles in size during the international festival and the fringe, but we do not have the tax base to generate all the investment that we need.</p><p>There is cross-party support on the council for the concept of a tourist levy, which is one of the key ideas that came out of &#8220;Thundering Hooves&#8221;, but the Scottish Government has not yet given its support to that. Today, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities commission on strengthening local democracy argues for much more financial flexibility and scope for local decision making. I leave that as a challenge for the cabinet secretary to pick up on. If she does not do so this afternoon, I hope that she will have a private discussion on the matter with the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth. That would be a very practical way to empower the city to do a great deal more.</p><p>I flag up the fact that we have new festivals springing up all the time, and an all-year-round approach would be great. We have the interfaith festival, the just festival and the take one action festival, which I particularly love. It starts on 19 September, which is a day that we can all look forward to. It is a campaigning festival. We also have the Scottish history festival in November.</p><p>The international festival and the fringe&#8212;our official festivals&#8212;are fantastic and need more support. We need to think particularly about the next generation that is coming through our universities, colleges and schools&#8212;our next playwrights, set designers, programmers, artists, musicians and singers. All the young people who are coming through need support. We need the infrastructure, the money, the marketing and the support from the Scottish Government, but we also need to think about our schools, colleges and universities. The future of the festivals is crucial.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I join colleagues in thanking Drew Smith for enabling us to have this debate.</p><p>Following on from the points that John Mason has just made, I do not think that colleagues in the chamber are setting out to be either for or against Israel or for or against Palestine. Quite a few members have made it clear that people support the two-state solution, in which Palestine and Israel would sit side by side as neighbours, trading with each other and respecting each other&#8217;s borders.</p><p>However, the challenge is that we are as far away from that solution as we have ever been. I visited Gaza 30 years ago on a UN youth visit, and some of the young people I met then will be the mothers and fathers of the children who, as Claudia Beamish has made clear, are now experiencing extreme psychological damage. The contrast between the schools run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East that I saw, which were dynamic and happy places of learning, and the schools that we see on our television screens now could not be more complete. It says it all when experienced journalists and UN officials find it difficult to compose themselves on TV.</p><p>What we are seeing is unimaginable to us. It is almost impossible for us to imagine a situation in which one and a half million people do not have regular access to drinking water, in which there are no power supplies and in which there is almost daily bombing. According to the statistics, 58 per cent of young people, 52 per cent of women and 37 per cent of men in Gaza are unemployed. Those families have absolutely no scope to make an income.</p><p>In thinking about what we can do, we need to consider the humanitarian support that is being provided. Considering what they have to deal with, the aid agencies are doing heroic work, and we need to do as much as we can as individuals, political representatives and members of our communities to support their fantastic and vital humanitarian work.</p><p>However, we must also demand a political solution. The two-state solution requires the two sides to sit and talk to each other. We know that they do not like each other&#8212;after all, they are in a conflict situation&#8212;but as other members have pointed out we will not get peace without the parties in the conflict sitting down and being prepared to work together. The parties in this conflict will not choose to do that; instead, they will have to be brought to the negotiating table by a world that is determined to make that happen.</p><p>The use of economic power and sustained political pressure will help in that, and tonight we can add our own pressure to the process. We can do that through procurement, whether or not that means choosing to buy Palestinian goods where they are still being produced, and we can do the same as citizens by looking to the fair trade movement and shops such as Hadeel that are still sourcing Palestinian-made goods such as olive oil and embroidery. Those are some practical steps that we can take.</p><p>However, the bigger picture is, as others have pointed out, all about the use of economic and political power. That power must be used, because this conflict has been going on for decades.

It is important that we celebrate our special relationship with Malawi. Its existence during the past decade has enriched both countries through the various relationships between the two Governments and the two Parliaments and between people, which are all crucial.</p><p>I strongly support the Labour amendment because it places an extra emphasis on the vital connections that we are building between people. That is not to say, of course, that the relationship between the two Governments is not important: the development programme and the development of links between the two Governments during the past decade have been vital.</p><p>The initial links in health and education have been crucial in enabling our contribution to reducing maternal mortality and the levels of HIV infection that exist in Malawi. They have also been crucial in addressing the challenge of expanding and improving education opportunities, particularly for young girls not only in primary school but, as time goes on, in secondary school and in further and higher education.</p><p>Those initial key areas of work have enabled a large number of non-governmental organisations and community organisations to come in with and build on the Scottish Government&#8217;s work and to add their own contributions.</p><p>The work that is being done on climate change and renewables is important. Agriculture, for example, is crucially important to Malawi. When we last visited, rampant inflation was a key issue for the economy and all the Malawian community groups related to farming were very concerned about access to fertilisers. There is research on climate change, but a huge raft of work is needed on water quality. One lesson from our last visit was that it is not enough simply to put infrastructure in; trained local people with the skills, knowledge and resources to keep that infrastructure working are also needed. In a developing country there is nothing worse than a broken water feature&#8212;it is a tantalising feature that shows people what might have been.</p><p>The chance to share knowledge and skills and to promote sustainable development is crucial. The minister&#8217;s point about enabling Malawi&#8217;s economy to grow is right. In terms of civic participation, we can do more through fair trade and the Co-operative movement to enable some of the smallest and most isolated communities in Malawi to be successful.</p><p>The Parliament-to-Parliament relationship, which Murdo Fraser briefly mentioned, is important. People in Scotland should not underestimate the importance of the sharing of good practice. The foundation of our own Parliament was based on accountability, transparency and equality, and on the knowledge that we were building on the best practice of other institutions. We do not say that we represent the only way or the best way to do everything, but we can say, &#8220;Here is our experience, for good or ill. Here is what has worked and what has not worked.&#8221;</p><p>A large part of the work that Alex Fergusson and I did on our last visit was to share our experiences, particularly on audit and on holding Government ministers to account. A successful parliamentary democracy needs effective opposition. It is very interesting to visit a country that is a developing democracy; it is not about imposing what we do and how we do it, but about opening up a discussion and a debate on how best to hold a Government to account.</p><p>I will finish on the people-to-people link, because that is the crucial element that Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s amendment focuses on. Most of us get very excited about the people-to-people link, because of the huge number of people in our community&#8212;as is well recorded by the Scotland Malawi Partnership&#8212;who are involved in day-to-day organisational campaigning, volunteering, community solidarity and the provision of support for one of the world&#8217;s poorest and most disadvantaged communities.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland and Malawi"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>Thank you very much.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland and Malawi"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>Under subsection (4) of new section 4A of the Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004, as introduced by section 72 of the bill, a local authority will be required to notify an owner if it intends to pay a share of scheme costs on that owner&#8217;s behalf. Amendment 59 seeks to ensure that the bill is sufficiently clear about the process in circumstances in which the reason for the local authority intervening is an inability to identify or find the owner in question. When I raised the issue at stage 2, I was directed to section 30 of the 2004 act, which states that, when an owner cannot be identified, a notice will be deemed to have been sent if it is delivered to the property addressed to the owner, proprietor or something similar.</p><p>That might seem to be a trivial point, but I am keen for us to be clear about what that means and I want to tease out from the minister whether the current requirement in the bill to notify an owner is consistent with the issuing of an official notice under the 2004 act. Amendment 59 would remove any ambiguity around that point.</p><p>Amendment 60 would require the Scottish Government to publish guidance about the operation of section 4 of the 2004 act on tenement management schemes and new section 4A on the power of local authorities to pay a missing share of scheme costs. New section 4A introduces significant and welcome new powers to minimise delays and assist owners who take their maintenance responsibilities seriously to get repairs moving.</p><p>Getting the powers right is one thing; ensuring that they are being used to the best effect is another challenge. The requirement for the Scottish Government to produce guidance in consultation with local authorities and other stakeholders will help to ensure that all parties are aware of the provisions and the scope that they provide for ensuring that common repairs are implemented timeously. That will also allow for a review of any existing guidance that is available to local authorities and others on the operation of the tenement management scheme to ensure that 10 years on from the act, the legislation is operating effectively. From talking to local authority colleagues, I think that it is clear that the existing legislation is complex and not necessarily being used to best effect. It would be useful to bring together the new legislation with existing legislation.</p><p>Alongside official guidance for professionals, I would welcome the minister&#8217;s comments on whether, in light of the bill, the Government will revisit and update the &#8220;Common Repair, Common Sense&#8221; booklet to assist consumers and residents to navigate the amended legislation that we are going to pass tonight.</p><p>Amendment 61 acknowledges that registered social landlords would benefit from having a discretionary power to recover their costs from private owners by a repayment charge along the same lines as that introduced for local authorities. I was first made aware of that by a constituent who sought support from the local housing association to help with getting repairs carried out when the housing association owns one or more properties, but the housing associations would not act. When I raised the issue in evidence sessions on David Stewart&#8217;s Defective and Dangerous Buildings (Recovery of Expenses) (Scotland) Bill, there was a strong mood that we need to act on the issue.</p><p>I am pleased that the minister has listened to the arguments that I made on the issue at stage 2 and I am also grateful for her assistance in crafting a revised amendment that I hope will be crafted in such a way that we can pass it happily this afternoon. Housing associations are expected to ensure that the properties that they let meet the minimum standard that is set out in the Scottish housing quality standard, but they cannot do that in some cases because they cannot get consent from owners in other parts of the buildings to carry out common works. As co-owners, they have the right to carry out work in tenements in which they own a majority of flats or if they can secure the support of a sufficient number of owners to form a majority, but they cannot force those other owners to come to the table. That is left up to civil remedies, which are not as successful because the process is protracted and hugely costly and it is not a route that housing associations choose.</p><p>We clearly have a problem here. If registered social landlords had the discretionary power to recover costs from private owners by using repayment charges that are along the same lines as those introduced for local authorities in section 72 of the bill, that would transform the situation.</p><p>The amendment creates a regulation-making power. Before using it, the Scottish Government would be required to carry out a consultation and consider the views of stakeholders. That is critical, because it gives everyone the opportunity to comment on the detail of how the regulation might be made. If we put it in the bill today, it means that it will happen, but the details need to be sorted out. Enabling the minister to propose the regulatory powers would be the right way to do that, because it would mean that the Parliament would be able to scrutinise them.</p><p>I am aware that housing associations have been forced to take properties out of their letting pools because they cannot afford to cover the necessary common repairs. That reduces the availability of social housing when we already have a challenge because of a shortage of housing. Amendment 59 is crucial because it will allow housing associations to play their part in ensuring that buildings are kept wind and watertight and up to the Scottish housing quality standard. The amendment provides protection for vulnerable home owners who might be adversely affected by a registered social landlord&#8217;s decision to recover costs because it includes a right to appeal to ministers.</p><p>The amendments in this part of the bill are crucial to strengthening the bill when it is passed tonight.</p><p>I move amendment 59.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>I am delighted that, as I understand it, the minister will support amendment 59. On amendment 60, I agree with her that the tenement management scheme should be the first port of call, but I am concerned that that is not the case for many residents.

Amendment 60 would strengthen those powers.</p><p>The legislative provisions are complex.

I am keen for the Scottish Government to be as proactive as possible in ensuring that local authorities and owners know as much as they can, so that the difficult part of forcing people to pay is the last backstop and not the first approach.</p><p>We have not mentioned the statutory notices problem in Edinburgh; notices were used principally because owners did not work together.

Amendment 62 stems from an issue that demonstrates that point effectively.</p><p>At stage 2, Jim Eadie lodged an amendment that would have required owners to prepare maintenance plans to cover common repairs, with a view to encouraging responsible home ownership. Under the amendment, failure by owners to complete a home maintenance plan would have constituted a ground for the local authority to consider that a house was unlikely to be maintained to a reasonable standard, for the purposes of issuing a maintenance order. The amendment had its origins in evidence that the City of Edinburgh Council gave to the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee.</p><p>However, in response to that amendment, the minister argued that local authorities already have the power to require an owner, through a maintenance order, to draw up a maintenance plan. We therefore have a situation in which local authorities are calling for measures to promote more responsible home maintenance by owners, while the minister says that the existing powers are sufficient.</p><p>Amendment 62 aims to dig into the operation of the existing powers by requiring the Scottish Government to report regularly on the use of maintenance orders. If the amendment is agreed to, it will require the Government to produce a report on a variety of issues to do with local authorities&#8217; use of maintenance orders from the time when the powers came into force to the present day. The amendment would also require subsequent reports to be produced on a three-yearly basis. Such reports would provide us with useful insight into how the powers are being used. The findings would put us in a much better position to be able to assess whether the powers as currently constituted are achieving their purpose, or whether further work is needed to support local authorities to use them effectively.</p><p>We have the Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004, and we have since 2004 considered several bills that relate to housing. It is important that the Scottish Government monitor the effectiveness of our legislation and that the Parliament carry out legislative scrutiny.

As members have seen this afternoon, for a minister in another party to have all the amendments that he has lodged accepted by the mover of the bill is not actually a usual occurrence in this place. I congratulate David Stewart on his commitment to the issue and on his success in steering his member&#8217;s bill through the committee and past the minister&#8212;and for enlisting us all in the process, as the issue is an important one.</p><p>The evidence sessions that the committee held were invaluable in teasing out the issues from a wide range of stakeholders, including in particular local authorities, which clearly experience a gap in their powers. In the current financial climate, it is important that local authorities do not subsidise repairs to buildings that should properly be carried out by their owners. I thank the committee for its work, and I also thank all the stakeholders who submitted evidence. I hope that the bill that we will pass this afternoon captures all the sensible contributions that were made in the Parliament.</p><p>My party is keen to support the bill, and I am politically and personally keen to support it not only because of my knowledge of buildings in the city of Edinburgh and the Lothians, but because of the impact that it will have across the country. The bill is important for the character of our towns and cities and for the quality of our built environment. We are all aware of the negative message that decaying, unlooked-after buildings send out in our local communities. They can have a social and an economic impact, and there is also the issue of safety that David Stewart mentioned. Buildings that are in disrepair and are not properly looked after can be exceedingly unsafe for both users and the public. Last night, I spoke in a members&#8217; business debate on the Rana Plaza disaster, which is a tragic example of what happens when buildings are not looked after and are not used for the right purpose.</p><p>The bill is a practical piece of legislation and an important one. In my region of the Lothians alone, 46 dangerous building notices were issued in 2011-12&#8212;in just one year&#8212;so I very much welcome the practical provisions in the bill that will enable local authorities to recoup the costs of dealing with dangerous buildings.</p><p>The minister mentioned a couple of provisions that have changed between the initial proposals and the final bill that we will pass today. I particularly welcome the change on the 30-year payback issue, which has been addressed in the final bill. There should be scope for sensitivity to an owner&#8217;s circumstances, and local authorities should be able to address that. I flag up that issue because it was addressed in the equality impact assessment that accompanies the bill. It is particularly important for people on low incomes, who will now have a different opportunity to pay the bill on the sale of their property. The change to the attachment of orders to the property rather than the person is important in that respect.</p><p>The amendments that the minister successfully moved are also important. In particular, amendment 7 will prevent owners from dodging their liability and trying to ignore their responsibility for buildings that they have profited from. For that reason, it is good that we were able to amend David Stewart&#8217;s bill this afternoon.</p><p>At present there is about &#163;3.9 million of outstanding debt and only 50 per cent of local authority costs are recouped. We need to address that. The bill will plug that gap and address the problem by ensuring that local authorities, which are currently cash strapped, will be able to recoup their costs from the owners who have benefited from owning the buildings. I hope that this afternoon, across the parties, the Parliament is sending out a message that we all believe that owners need to take proper responsibility for maintaining their properties in good order.</p><p>I reiterate David Stewart&#8217;s view that the provisions in the bill should be a last resort and not a first resort. I say that in the knowledge that, in Edinburgh, the statutory repairs notice has become a first resort rather than last resort for far too many owners, with negative consequences. Next week we will debate the Housing (Scotland) Bill and we will again strengthen the scope for local authorities to step in where individual owners will not pay their share. The two bills represent important and beneficial changes in legislation that aim to ensure that we have well-maintained, safe buildings.</p><p>I look forward to David Stewart&#8217;s bill being passed today and to its becoming law, and I look forward to local authorities across the country being able to use the provisions in the bill in practical ways to improve the quality and safety of our built environment.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Buildings (Recovery of Expenses) (Scotland) Bill"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>It is always a joy to follow Chic Brodie.</p><p>Devolution gives us the best of both worlds.

All those sectors have grown and been strengthened under a strong Scottish Parliament that has worked in partnership with the rest of the UK. We can do all that without the division and disruption that would come from the uncosted independence plans that the SNP would take us through.</p><p>Strong devolution is about living in an interdependent world, where no one party or institution is all-powerful, and where we have to work together for the greater good.

It is also about funding streams and building capacity and capability. It is about supporting our rural and island communities and giving them opportunities to do more. Stronger devolution as part of the UK is a much better future for Scotland.</p><p>Over the past seven years, the SNP could have acted on all the issues that I have mentioned, if it had wanted to do so. I think that historians will look back and question Alex Salmond&#8217;s judgment in waiting for seven and a half years to have a referendum, when he could have got going at the start of his term of office. We could have tested this issue seven and a half years ago.</p><p>Within three months of the Labour Government being elected in 1997, we had a referendum and a decision and we were able to get on with exercising power, seeking opportunities to tackle social injustice and building solidarity. That is the legacy of the Blair Government and of Donald Dewar.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>No, thank you.</p><p>The decision not to act on the bedroom tax in 2013 tells us everything that we need to know about the cynicism of the SNP. The SNP could have used the powers that it had. It could have considered how to help local authorities.</p><p>As we predicted, there was a cost to that year of inaction, which left thousands in debt for the first time in their lives and meant that councils and housing associations had to divert scarce cash out of investment programmes and away from improving their housing stock in order to support their tenants. It also left a sting in the tail that councils are now having to address. Those people who paid their bills and the bedroom tax when they could ill afford it are now aggrieved, and councils are having to deal with that reality. The SNP could have done more.</p><p>Our local authorities do not have the luxury of playing with politics. They have to make decisions now, in the real world; they cannot put difficult decisions on hold. For example, social care challenges are increasing. On Monday, I spoke to a constituent who has worked as a care worker for 23 years but is on the verge of giving up because of the pressure and the lack of time that she is allowed to devote to the people for whom she cares. She believes that her hard work is not valued, and I think that she is right.</p><p>The work that Unison is doing to highlight the need to tackle inequality and the work that has been done with Renfrewshire Council show what we need to do instead of sticking with the sterile and cynical debate that the SNP would push us into. We need an urgent debate about how our local authorities provide improved quality services to the people who need them now. Local authorities need to expand their training and integrate their work on employability. They want to work at a local and a regional level with employers and colleges to deliver strategies that will work. That is what they need to do and we should be empowering them to do that, not telling them why they cannot do it or cutting back on the further education sector.</p><p>At our Scottish Labour councillors conference at the weekend, we had a fantastic set of discussions about the work that is being done now by councillors, even with the challenges that the SNP has put in their way. They are consulting communities, looking at the tough budget choices, shaping their services and getting on with implementing their manifesto commitments now, despite the centralising and underfunding agenda that they face. Fantastic work is being done in West Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Glasgow and Edinburgh to make sure that our young people have real opportunities for training, but so much more can be done.</p><p>We need only look at the local government elections that have taken place over the past 18 months to see that that work is acknowledged by communities. They do not want their local authorities to be used as a political football; they want people to get on and do the work now. We can see the challenge that is being met by our Labour councillors. Looking at the number of seats that Labour has won in the past 18 months, we are currently running 13:1&#8212;Labour has won 13 seats in the past 18 months, whereas the SNP has won a single seat. Some of those by-elections were caused by SNP councillors resigning from their council, which tells a story that is not being debated here. At the weekend, I was delighted to speak to Lesley McDonald, a South Lanarkshire councillor who was an SNP member for 30 years but who has now joined Labour, and to welcome Neil MacIntyre, the first Labour councillor ever to be elected to serve Oban South and the Isles on Argyll and Bute Council.</p><p>Something is happening at the local level.

Let us get on to 19 September.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>First, I thank colleagues for their support, which has enabled me to secure the motion for debate. There are constituents of mine who were very interested in the fact that we would be debating the issue this evening.</p><p>It is important that we raise awareness of what needs to be done to tackle the conditions that led to 1,129 Bangladeshi garment workers losing their lives, and to 2,500 people being injured in the Rana Plaza building collapse.</p><p>The twenty-fourth of April was the first anniversary of this tragic disaster, in which an eight-storey building collapsed in Savar, near Dhaka in Bangladesh. I will use my speech this evening to highlight what happened, why we should be concerned, what happened after the disaster, what wider lessons need to be learned and what action still needs to be taken.</p><p>The building that collapsed was not fit for purpose. It was not built to house the weight of machinery that was in it. There had already been a warning about safety, which had gone unheeded. The workers were paid a pittance for their work, as is the case in many factories in Bangladesh where garments are produced. We should be concerned, because some of those garments find their way into chains that are present in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.</p><p>I highlight the two key initiatives that took place in Bangladesh after the incident. First, there was the accord that was signed by the Bangladesh Government, the key industries, the trade unions and non-governmental organisations. In the immediate aftermath of the event, it was estimated that 90 per cent of buildings in Bangladesh did not meet the local building codes, never mind international building standards. In a country that is prone to earthquakes, that is a major challenge for the Bangladeshi Government and local government in the country to address. The &#8220;Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh&#8221; has been a big step forward. Oxfam records that more than 1,500 factories in Bangladesh will now be inspected. We must regard that as key progress.</p><p>Much more needs to be done on the other major initiative that brought together the Government, the industry, trade unions and NGOs. Although the Rana Plaza agreement has been strongly welcomed by people, it has led to a challenge. Although some companies have made donations and some people have been compensated for their loss or for the health implications&#8212;in cases of people who needed support afterwards and in cases of people whose capacity to work was removed&#8212;there is simply nowhere near enough in the fund to enable the second set of compensation agreements to be debated and to be handed out to the thousands of people whose lives were ruined by the experience and the distress that came with it.</p><p>Donor organisations include well-known names such as Gap, Asda and Debenhams, and some companies that have paid into the fund were not connected to the Rana Plaza disaster, but some of the biggest retail companies, whose names are known to us all, have not contributed and campaigns have sprung up to highlight that. Only 40 per cent of the target has been reached, and many companies have yet to make a significant contribution or indeed any contribution.</p><p>Although no Scottish companies sourced clothes from the Rana Plaza, Alison Johnstone, who is not in the chamber this evening, lodged a motion that referred to Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which sourced clothes from the Tazreen Fashions factory, where more than 100 people died in another incident. The motion suggested that more needs to be done to establish accountability and contributions in relation to that incident. Scottish Education and Action for Development, which supports that call, also wants chains of responsibility to be established for companies that are sourcing garments for the Commonwealth games. The charity particularly wants the minister to respond to that call.</p><p>There are issues to do with compensation and building safety. We should also ask questions about the pay and terms and conditions of Bangladeshi workers who produce garments that developed nations import. In future, the day on which the Rana Plaza disaster took place will be commemorated as fashion revolution day. The campaign aims to highlight the rights of garment workers, so that there is an annual focus on the issue and we never forget the loss of life at Rana Plaza.</p><p>It has been reported that Bangladeshi workers are some of the lowest paid in the world, taking home less than 62 per cent of the living wage. Nearly 40 per cent of the garment factories in Dhaka fail to pay the minimum wage. The International Labour Organization and Oxfam highlight the problem and challenge us to ask questions about the clothing that we buy.</p><p>The issue was addressed recently in a motion that Kez Dugdale lodged. Across the parties in the Parliament, there has been interest in ensuring that we highlight the issues. I think that doing so is an act of international solidarity and social justice. Members of the Scottish Parliament can promote the issue on an individual level and by working with organisations and NGOs in our communities.</p><p>The clean clothes campaign draws attention to brands that have made insufficient or no contributions to the Rana Plaza fund. That campaign and the fashion revolution campaign will sit alongside the work of established organisations such as SEAD and Oxfam, which have long called for justice for workers and lobbied for major companies to take responsibility for tackling poverty pay.</p><p>No worker&#8217;s life should be put at risk because of a failure to put appropriate safety measures in place. The anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster is one that we should remember in future. We need to acknowledge that people died in tragic circumstances and to enable their deaths to serve as a reminder of the importance of health and safety at work, abroad and at home.</p><p>We must campaign for the rigorous protection of all workers&#8217; rights. Many members celebrated workers memorial day this year, when workers across the world agreed to stand in solidarity to remember the dead, fight for the living and ensure that lessons are learned and tragedies are not repeated.</p><p>There are issues that we need to take up in our communities. There is a challenge to get Scottish consumers and companies to support stronger accountability from companies that source clothes from factories across the world for sale here. We need to draw attention to the chain of responsibility and encourage our constituents and organisations and companies that are active in Scotland to consider it in the context of their procurement and sourcing policies.</p><p>Today in the Scottish Parliament we can add our voices to calls for justice for garment workers, so that they receive fair pay and decent and safe working conditions. We do so in an act of solidarity with some of the lowest-paid workers, who experience working conditions that would not be acceptable here and in the rest of the developed world. Let us use our political influence to support those workers.</p><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the motion. I hope that in his closing remarks the minister will talk about how the Scottish Government can highlight the campaigns that I have talked about, assist with the chain of accountability and support corporate social responsibility in Scottish companies.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Rana Plaza Disaster (First Anniversary)"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>What timescale has the minister set out for putting in place the review of training for health professionals and for updating publications to ensure that bereaved parents and families get the right support and guidance, as referred to at paragraphs 2.1 and 2.54 of Lord Bonomy&#8217;s report?

He mentioned issues that concern many people. I was so concerned about housing land, development priority and the order in which development takes place that I asked the city council to give all the relevant MPs and MSPs in the Lothians a briefing on that. We had that meeting in January, which was useful.</p><p>One key challenge that was presented to us was that, when the previous local plan was put in place, it allocated 18,000 houses to Forth Ports land. When Forth Ports removed that, that created a challenge for the city. A difficult issue lies at the heart of the agenda. We need more houses in Edinburgh. We need more affordable housing for rent and for housing associations and council housing and we need more affordable housing to buy. The lack of new provision and the fact that many houses have been taken out of general residential use to provide short-term lets in the tourism industry mean that we have phenomenal pressure on housing. For those reasons, I am glad to have the debate.</p><p>One challenge is that we might see increasing social polarisation as people who are on low, modest or even relatively good incomes cannot afford to buy property in the city. As they do not qualify for social rented housing, they face the relatively high cost of rented accommodation or they have to leave the city. That is not good for us. Having lived in London previously, I worry about Edinburgh going in the same direction. More investment in social rented properties, particularly on brownfield sites, is crucial. That must be a priority in SESplan 2.</p><p>I support the council&#8217;s policy of having 25 per cent social rented housing on major developments. That is important, because housing is in short supply. We also need to focus on the different types of house that are needed. It is about the cost and the availability of the right kind of housing. In my casework, I see a lot of families and older people who are looking for housing and cannot afford the housing that is available at the moment.</p><p>I will finish on the issue of the challenge that faces house builders. The costs of development have increased, as has the cost of finance, and that is a real challenge that runs through SESplan. It is referred to in the reporter&#8217;s findings on the spatial strategy in SESplan, in which he says that there will be challenges to the delivery of housing in the short term because of the limited resources that are available for development and supporting infrastructure. It is partly a challenge of development infrastructure from the council and the lack of capital investment that the council has for new houses and infrastructure, particularly transport infrastructure. It is also an issue of finance for the development industry.</p><p>The housing land audit that was carried out last year shows that a key part of the story is the number of sites that were identified in the local plans but which are not being implemented. There were 12 sites for which consent has expired. The plans were in the development plan and given planning permission, but the development was not taken forward. There were 16 local planned sites with no consent or activity on them. Consent was given for those sites and they were in the local plan, but they were not taken forward. There were 10 sites where the developer or the company went into administration. All that is a key part of the story that needs to be part of tonight&#8217;s debate. Sites have been identified for development but they are no longer being taken forward. Questions must be asked about those sites and the capacity to develop them. They were the top priorities for the council the last time. There are massive implications from the loss of the Leith port sites, and the council now faces a difficult situation.</p><p>When the minister sums up, I hope that he will show that he has listened to representations from the council and those of us here tonight who are concerned about the lack of progress on brownfield and approved sites in the latest development plan.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Strategic Planning (Lothians)"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13956.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13956", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Sarah Boyack", "member_id": "80504", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Lothian"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Boyack", "left_house": "2011-03-23", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13956.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13956", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Sarah Boyack", "member_id": "80286", "entered_house": "2007-05-03", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Edinburgh Central"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Boyack", "left_house": "2007-04-02", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13956.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13956", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Sarah Boyack", "member_id": "80010", "entered_house": "2003-05-01", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Edinburgh Central"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Boyack", "left_house": "2003-03-31", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13956.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13956", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Sarah Boyack", "member_id": "80134", "entered_house": "1999-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Edinburgh Central"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Kezia", "last_name": "Dugdale", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p></p><p>5.

I was worried that my colleagues would not understand the complex and long-standing community interest in the issue and that they would be cold to the arguments from both sides and simply go through the motions, without an affinity for the community in question.</p><p>On reflection, that approach was exactly what was needed. I commend committee members and the clerks for their dedicated but dispassionate approach to the bill. They have examined the detail in great depth and have often delved into the detail beyond the strict application of the bill, producing a report that is thorough, robust and a credit to the Parliament.</p><p>I have received a number of emails from people who are opposed to the bill, which have questioned the committee&#8217;s integrity. Each email follows the same format and highlights the same key points; it feels co-ordinated in the way that many charity-led campaign emails do, but it does not have the parallel numbers.</p><p>The same email says that MSPs across Scotland were being told to vote in favour of the bill before any evidence had been heard, and that there is clear evidence that the bill is being rushed through as a political decision and is not being considered on its merits. I categorically refute those suggestions. There is no Labour whip in place for this afternoon&#8217;s vote and I understand that every other party represented in the chamber has taken the same decision.</p><p>I say to colleagues across the chamber who have perhaps yet to make up their minds that I will vote for the City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill at 4.45 this afternoon, and I will do so with every confidence that it represents the majority will of the community.</p><p>There is substantial evidence of community support in the preliminary stage report and in the consideration stage report that was published last month. Let me add to that the reality of my five years of solid campaigning in the constituency. I have spoken to thousands and thousands of voters face to face on their doorsteps. I know that the community wants this school and wants it on the park.</p><p>I will say a bit more about the community in my closing speech, but I will spend the last few minutes of my opening speech examining the suggestion that has been made by the objectors that the bill will somehow set a precedent on common good land. The objectors&#8217; email states that because</p><p>&#8220;there are no plans to reform common good legislation, this bill if passed will allow other councils to take common good land for any purpose they wish&#8221;.</p><p>It is exactly because the bill is so narrowly defined that no precedent is set. Should Parliament vote in favour of the bill this afternoon, the law of common good remains unchanged except for the specific instance of Portobello park. Paragraph 38 of the consideration stage report could not be clearer in that regard.</p><p>The final point that is made regularly in emails from objectors is that the Parliament is overruling a judgment of the courts. The committee addressed that point ably by highlighting the role of the courts as interpreting and applying the law as it stands. Parliament has the power to legislate as it considers appropriate, even if the effect is to change the law as determined by a court. In the simplest terms, that is democracy.</p><p>The committee also addressed the European convention on human rights issues. I understand that objectors are considering that as their next legal move. The committee&#8217;s preliminary stage report noted that</p><p>&#8220;a fair balance has been struck between the competing interests of those adversely affected by the scheme and the benefits to the wider community.&#8221;</p><p>The principle of proportionality has been applied, and I would ask the objectors to consider the concept of proportionality when they consider their next attempt to block the school.</p><p>I reiterate my thanks to my diligent colleagues who have served the committee since its establishment. I urge my colleagues in the chamber to vote based on the strength of the consideration stage report. They should be in no doubt that the vast majority of community support is for the bill to progress.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill: Final Stage"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>It is our last day of term but, instead of getting out the board games, we are here discussing a very important issue. It is worth pointing out how full the public gallery is. I welcome a number of community councillors, the chair of the Portobello for a new school&#8212;PFANS&#8212;campaign and a number of PFANS members, as well as my Labour colleagues Joan Griffiths and Maureen Child, who are both councillors for the school catchment area. I have also seen the outstanding headteacher of the school, Peigi Macarthur.</p><p>There are many other local residents in the public gallery and watching online. Perhaps some are following the debate through the TalkPorty Twitter account or through the Facebook page &#8220;A New Porty High School in the Park&#8221;, which has more than 2,500 followers. That is evidence of a real community spirit and support for a school on the park.</p><p>In the preliminary stage debate, I shared with members the story of Jessie, whose mum and dad I met while chapping doors in the area. Jessie challenged me to take a tour of the school and I did so, recognising how important it was to see the school through the eyes of a child.</p><p>Jessie was in primary 2 at Towerbank primary school when she was first promised a new school. She will most likely leave Portobello high school having achieved a complete set of highers in the current building. She has spent an educational lifetime waiting for a new school, and it will likely pass her by.</p><p>Jessie has had a first-class education at Portobello high school, as every failure of the building has been more than compensated by the determination of the staff to deliver that education. I pay tribute to the headteacher, Peigi Macarthur, for leading a school that is pounding with life, culture, sport and opportunity. She has never let the challenges of the building overshadow the school&#8217;s achievements, and for that she must be commended.</p><p>I was at Portobello high last week to see the school show, &#8220;Schools Will Rock You&#8221;, and I was blown away by the talent of pupils and the dedication of staff who were involved in the production. However, there was a sense of make-do-and-mend: there were a lot of plugs for various bits of equipment all jammed in one place, and the windows were blacked out.</p><p>I can contrast that experience with my visit last week to the new Dunfermline high school, which has a dedicated theatre space with all the rigging and the fancy stuff that many an Edinburgh festival theatre venue would envy.</p><p>In addition, the Dunfermline school has dedicated 3G pitches, which made me think of the bus trip that the Portobello pupils have to take to the Jack Kane sports centre for physical education lessons. The provision for PE at Portobello is so poor that the school has a special dispensation for the target of two hours of PE, as it has had for years.</p><p>I look at the bright, airy and spacious school in Dunfermline and contrast it with the stairwells at Portobello, which are cramped and fraught with problems. Classes at the school are timetabled on the basis of the traffic in the stairwells, in an attempt to minimise the amount of time that the kids spend walking through them from class to class.</p><p>I am not envious or jealous of Dunfermline high school, but proud of it. I am proud that we have a school that befits the ambitions of its pupils and teachers, and I want that for everyone, including those in Portobello. I want Portobello to have a first-class community school because of its building, not in spite of it. It would be a community asset and, in my view and according to a number of members in the chamber, an enriching one.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report is not black and white. It recognised that the consultation was not perfect, but it stated:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee does not consider that any shortcomings identified in the consultation process are sufficient to sustain any objection regarding the consultation&#8217;s adequacy.&#8221;</p><p>That takes us back to the concept of proportionality. The question is not whether the consultation was flawed, but whether any flaws were considered to be serious enough. The same goes for the minor loss of green space, views or house price values. The question is not the validity of those arguments, but whether they constitute enough of a reason to block the building of the school on the park.</p><p>Members should look at the report&#8217;s conclusion. It is quite unusual, as Alison McInnes pointed out, for a committee to comment on the polarisation of the parties involved in a bill. The committee has sent a strong message to the community that it should find a way through the situation. We may think that the referendum debate is fractious and divisive, but it has nothing on the school debate in the Portobello community.</p><p>I hope that the journey towards reconciliation and the future will start today, with a vote in this Parliament in favour of building the school on the park. With that vote, I understand that the shovels could be in the ground as soon as September and a new school could be ready for the start of the 2016 term.

If I have time, I will consider the additional promises that the Government has made.</p><p>The magic number of &#163;4.5 billion represents the money that we would need to find. It is also the drop in oil revenue between 2011-12 and 2012-13&#8212;and it is the entire schools budget.</p><p>I have spent a lot of time knocking on doors and taking part in referendum debates, and I have met a lot of undecided voters who are completely scunnered by the way in which we talk about the country&#8217;s finances. One side says that people would be &#163;1,400 better off and the other side talks about &#163;1,000 with independence. People are left thinking that someone is going to run up to them with bundles of &#163;20 notes, because they do not realise that those projections are based on estimates about what the situation will be 10 or 15 years in the future. If economists cannot forecast one year ahead effectively, how can voters give any credence to such sales pitches? That is why the comparison between oil revenues and schools is such a compelling one. Here is a resource that is so volatile that a dip in its value from one year to the next is enough to wipe out the entire schools budget.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>I am merely making the point that that is how undecided voters look at the debate. They are trying to get their heads around the finances, but Mark McDonald&#8217;s side&#8217;s sums do not add up&#8212;and they do not add up to the size of the entire schools budget. That is where the size and security of the UK come in. The UK can carry that fluctuation in prices with far greater ease than an independent Scotland could.</p><p>In her amendment, the Deputy First Minister refers to the Government&#8217;s</p><p>&#8220;record of delivery under devolution&#8221;.</p><p>Let us look at the detail of that record in relation to education. Cash-terms spending on secondary schools is falling&#8212;from 2008 to 2011, it fell by &#163;91.4 million. Real-terms spending on secondary schools is also falling&#8212;since 2007, it is down 8.6 per cent.</p><p>Teachers are feeling the pressure of having to deliver more for less. The latest Educational Institute of Scotland teacher survey, which was published just last week, contains some startling statistics: only one teacher in three is satisfied with their working life; 84 per cent of teachers had varying levels of work-related stress; and only one teacher in 10 was satisfied with their current workload. The resounding message from teachers is that they do not feel heard, do not feel valued as professionals and do not feel that they are getting the support that they require.</p><p>Meanwhile, educational inequality persists. It is at its starkest when we examine the experiences of looked-after children in Scotland. This week, the Scottish Government produced a new report on looked-after children, although members would be hard pressed to find it underneath all the other bumf on the Scottish Government website, including proposals for a new constitution. That shows once again the complete lack of the Government&#8217;s exposure of, and priorities on, the issue.</p><p>Let us look at the headline numbers. First, 85 per cent of looked-after young people left school as soon as they were old enough, in comparison with 30 per cent of all school leavers. Only 62 per cent of looked-after kids had positive destinations after school, compared with 90 per cent of all school leavers. To the Government&#8217;s credit, that is a considerable improvement on 2009-10, but there is still a long way to go.</p><p>The news on tariff scores is not so good. The average tariff score of a looked-after child in Scotland is 86, whereas it is 407 across all school leavers. That means that kids who are not in care are outperforming kids in care by a rate of five to one. That is a shocking statistic, but it is not the most damning statistic in the Government&#8217;s report, because the gap is getting bigger: the tariff scores across all kids are increasing at twice the rate of that for looked-after children.</p><p>That matters in the debate because education is an entirely devolved issue. The Scottish Government, not the dastardly Administration 400 miles down the road, sets the priorities and makes the hard choices.</p><p>Peter Peacock asked the OECD to investigate Scottish schooling back in 2004. A comprehensive and compelling report was produced in 2007 showing that we had an inequality problem in our schools. The Government has completely failed to address it. That record speaks volumes about the Government&#8217;s commitment to tackling inequality in our schools.</p><p>The education maintenance allowance is another classic example. Mike Russell boasts about the increased number of school pupils who are in receipt of the EMA, but denies that he has cut &#163;10 million from the budget, while college students are unable to take it at all. There has been a 26 per cent cut in the EMA.</p><p>What about colleges? There has been a 37 per cent reduction in student numbers. The SNP will say that those numbers are wrong, but it fudged the statistics by redefining a full-time course. Once again, women are disproportionately affected by those changes. That is before we even get to the SNP&#8217;s childcare commitments. We and the Scottish Parliament information centre believe that those will cost &#163;1.1 billion, and the Government will not produce the economic model that will tell us where it will find that money.</p><p>The Government needs &#163;4.5 billion post-independence just to stand still, but it is standing still on the big issues such as educational inequality. That tells us everything that we need to know about its values and priorities. The Deputy First Minister says that we should look at the record. Well, the record on inequality is wafer thin.

I am pleased to see the cabinet secretary in her place, focusing on the gender aspect of her brief.</p><p>I have been reflecting on the past few years and, in particular, the youth unemployment crisis that we have experienced and from which, to a degree, we are still recovering. Governments of all hues across the whole of Europe responded to that crisis by appealing to the big multinational companies. They competed to bring new jobs and new facilities to their respective shores, often with cash incentives. A couple of years after that, many of those companies were embroiled in tax avoidance schemes, which led to a huge amount of public outrage. The political response to that was to start to talk about a more responsible capitalism, whereby we say to companies that we expect them to pay their taxes, but if they are receiving public money we expect them also to pay a living wage and to build apprenticeships into their contracts, and not to promote a zero-hours culture or to be involved in blacklisting&#8212;in fact, we expect them never to have done so. However, it has always been about bartering with the big guys, and too often the big guys win. We can make demands of them, but if we go too far we push them away and lose the investment in the country&#8217;s future.</p><p>Can we imagine a different type of economy&#8212;one that is built on home-grown businesses that pride themselves on being decent employers, rooted in the communities that they employ and which they buy from and sell to? Realising that ambition requires a change of culture.</p><p>Arguably, we do not value businesses enough in Scotland. As a nation, we have a proud history of public service but perhaps we are less proud of people who choose to make their own money and of how they go about doing that. Being pro-business in Scotland tends to mean believing in low taxes and deregulation, when it could be about being an enterprising nation that is confident and engenders skills and a belief in our nation&#8217;s great traditions and passing them on to the next generation. Setting up their own business could be good not only for the individual but for their community. That type of attitude has to start in schools, colleges and universities. Only when we get a critical mass in the next generation will we be able to drive the cultural change that we are looking for.</p><p>That applies in a number of ways. We need to think about the debates that we have had in the chamber about work readiness and what that means. We often talk about work readiness in the context of matching the skills that come out of our schools and colleges with the skills that business needs, but it is always about the supply chain for somebody else&#8217;s business; we never talk about what it means in the context of setting up one&#8217;s own business.</p><p>In all college and university courses, and in schools, there should be much more emphasis on setting up a business. Young people should be taught about rates and how they work, about tax and what Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is&#8212;and about what would happen if they were to get on the wrong side of HMRC. They should be taught about digitising business and the new opportunities that come from that. They should be taught about markets and how to pitch, turnover versus profit, whether one can recruit to grow and what the balance of risk is. Those are all staple issues for business students, but they should be built into all courses, in all disciplines. They should not just be a unitary extra; students should not be told, &#8220;This week, class, we&#8217;re going to talk about how to set up your own business.&#8221; Those issues should be embedded in the ethos of the work that goes on in our colleges and universities. Setting up a business should be an option for all students. Students in our colleges should be told, &#8220;It&#8217;s an option for students like you.&#8221;</p><p>I look at what my college, Edinburgh College, does on a number of campuses around Edinburgh. Mechanics, joiners, hairdressers, web designers and fitness instructors come out of the college every week. They are all predisposed to work for themselves but often that is not an option for them. They could start out with a start-up but they need a bit more help. It does not necessarily have to be a lonely activity. Pairing a web designer with a fitness instructor creates a whole new business model that could be explored. It could be the job of a college, school or university to encourage that type of activity. We need to de-risk the process. Colleges could invest in individuals to help them put their foot on the first step of the ladder, knowing that the rewards of that investment could come back to the college. Colleges could incubate such ideas and encourage people to work together, knowing that the benefits will come back to the college community and benefit everyone else.</p><p>I spoke earlier today to a former chair of the Federation of Small Businesses in Edinburgh who is an excellent female role model for women in business in her own right. I asked her what she wants from a strategy that encourages women into business and she said, &#8220;More role models.&#8221; Funnily enough, I had a similar conversation with an academic at the University of Edinburgh yesterday about the challenges of trying to engage women in science subjects and she, too, talked about role models. We need role models not just at the top of an industry&#8212;it is not about the elite&#8212;but at every stage of the journey. Yes, Michelle Mone is a fantastic role model for women in business, but Christina McKelvie and Christine Grahame talked about women in their communities who are already running their own businesses and who are also fantastic role models. We need to tell those stories so that women who are thinking about setting up a business can see somebody like them doing the same thing and draw strength from that.</p><p>The same applies to women who are already established in a business environment and want to expand their business. They need help to take that risk, employ more people or offer a different product. They need to be able to meet more women like them who have already taken such risks.</p><p>The first challenge is to see more women in business, full stop. However, let us not miss out on the opportunity to get it right and have the right mix of women at the forefront of public debate on this agenda. I am sure that the cabinet secretary will take that on board.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Improving Entrepreneurship among Women and Young People"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>I can help the minister by telling him that the actual number of students from outside the EU has gone up every year since 2007-08.

If only the media had taken the same approach, we might have had a different election result last week. Liz Smith was the first to introduce the European election results; Liam McArthur mentioned them in his closing speech, too. We should all unite against UKIP and we should stand up and take it on. The solutions that UKIP puts forward do not stack up when we look at the challenges that the UK faces. I believe UKIP to be a regressive, reactionary and racist force in UK politics. I take some comfort from the fact that the UKIP vote was just 7.7 per cent in Edinburgh, but it was as high as 13.6 per cent in other parts of the country. We have a duty to unite and defeat those arguments and that party with the power of our arguments and the will of our work.</p><p>I was pleased that Humza Yousaf mentioned the role of the National Union of Students and the approach that it takes to welcoming international students to our shores. It does not just welcome them; it gives them an active role in the democratic systems that we have in place for student participation in so many of our universities. The NUS leads much of the work around promoting a positive place for international students on our campuses. However, the minister did say that he would come back to the issue of colleges and I do not feel that he did that, so perhaps he will return to it in his closing speech.</p><p>The minister was also very gracious to mention the fresh talent initiative. I pay tribute to Jack McConnell&#8217;s leadership on that initiative. Jack McConnell&#8217;s most successful policy is often viewed as the smoking ban but, when we look behind the scenes, we could argue that the fresh talent initiative was one of the most innovative and progressive things that he did in the sense that it was a long-term policy that displayed a great deal of foresight about the population challenges that we face as a country and addressed them head on, much against the will of quite a right-wing press. We should unite in recognising that.</p><p>At the heart of Jack McConnell&#8217;s fresh talent initiative was the fundamental acceptance and belief that we could have UK-wide border controls with the flexibility within that system to reflect local and national circumstances. Fresh talent was combined with the wider programme of promoting Scotland overseas. The slogan was</p><p>&#8220;Now is the time, Scotland is the place&#8221;.</p><p>Behind that bold slogan, though, was a serious policy and a mechanism to deliver it.</p><p>Although we have heard much about the fresh talent initiative, we have not heard much about the relocation advisory service, which underpinned much of the fresh talent work. The service was introduced in 2004, at the same time as the fresh talent initiative, and was funded by the Scottish Government as part of the initiative. The Scottish Government continued to fund the service when fresh talent was absorbed into the UK Labour Government&#8217;s plans around tier 1 post-study visa schemes. The Scottish Government continued to support the service because it offered a one-stop-shop information advisory service for people looking to study, live and work in Scotland.</p><p>The relocation advisory service also worked with employers to provide advice and assistance when companies were looking to recruit staff from overseas. People could do that using the website www.scotlandistheplace.com. That website is no longer operational. In 2012, the Scottish Government restructured, and the relocation advisory service was subsumed into TalentScotland, a Scottish Enterprise initiative. On the TalentScotland website there is nothing like the same degree of work, information and services that the relocation advisory service offered. It is important that we recognise that.</p><p>There was also the one Scotland, many cultures campaign, which ran from 2002 to 2008-09. Earlier today, I asked SPICe to tell me whether there were any equivalent schemes now. It told me that there is no current anti-racism media campaign in Scotland but that marketing activity on equality issues is planned for later this year.</p><p>It is important to recognise those two factors because, as much as I agree with a lot of what Humza Yousaf has said today, if he is going to apportion blame, he has to look at his own record on the issue. The one Scotland, many cultures campaign and the relocation advisory service have disappeared. He would be in a stronger position today if he had maintained those services.</p><p>We have heard a lot about statistics today. I heard Stewart Maxwell say that the number of non-EU students studying in Scotland was decreasing. I am afraid that that is incorrect. I have the tables from the Higher Education Statistics Agency here, which show that the number of non-EU students studying in Scotland has increased every year from 2008 to the present day. In fact, in the past year it has increased by 11 per cent, which is double the UK-wide figure of 5 per cent. Stewart Maxwell is shaking his head&#8212;I would be happy to provide the HESA tables to him after the debate.</p><p>We agree with the minister that the current Tory-Lib Dem Government immigration policy poses a significant threat to our universities. The weight of concern from the universities sector is considerable. The minister will have more success in uniting the chamber if he does not overegg it, but I am afraid that his use of statistics today suggests that he might be doing that.</p><p>Although I have proved to the minister that the number of international students in higher education is increasing, the number in colleges is decreasing. In fact, it is half what it was when the minister&#8217;s party came into power in 2007. In 2008-09, Motherwell College had a progressive approach to attracting international students. It had one dedicated member of staff in China, specifically to attract Chinese students to study at the college. We are calling on the Government today to consider more of that type of work.</p><p>There are other issues behind the statistics, because we do not know the full impact of what they tell us. We do not know what percentage of international students remain in Scotland after they complete their studies or how many want to stay and draw on policies such as the post-study work visa programme. We do not know how many people want to stay long term and become resident in Scotland. We would be in a much better place if we had that information today.</p><p>We have talked a lot about countries from which the number of students coming to Scotland has fallen. India has been mentioned several times, and Jim Eadie mentioned the impact that that drop in numbers is having on the University of Edinburgh. I asked SPICe about that particular trend today and was told that a contributing factor to a reduction in the number of Indian students coming to study in Scotland is a massive and rapid expansion in the Indian higher education sector. Fewer Indian students are coming to Scotland because the university sector is growing there and Indian students are choosing to stay and study in India. I am not going to suggest that that is the whole reason for the reduction in numbers, but it is worth putting the situation into context.</p><p>I add that the number of students coming from China is going up, while the number coming from the USA and Canada is staying broadly the same.</p><p>My colleague Neil Bibby was absolutely right to introduce the rest-of-the-UK fees issue into the debate. I encourage all SNP members to look at the SPICe briefing, which shows that the white paper proposal is not legal. It is very clear that that is the case, and I refer them to the fourth point in that briefing, which says quite clearly&#8212;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Immigration Policy (Higher Education)"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>I am sorry to hear that; I would have very much welcomed the opportunity to hear from Jim Eadie on that point.

She suggested that grants were allocated on merit, not geography. UK research councils fund UK institutions. If we are not part of the United Kingdom, we will not have access to those funds&#8212;it really is that simple.</p><p>We cannot accept the SNP&#8217;s position because it implies that only independence would deliver a more progressive immigration policy.

A policy area that is completely devolved was being sold as the cornerstone case for independence. The commentariat was quick to link the policy to the polls and the sizeable gender gap when it comes to support for independence.</p><p>Although we added our voices to the collective cynicism, we did not lose sight of the ambition for a transformation in the provision of childcare. Whatever the result of the vote at 5.30 today, the Parliament will have accepted</p><p>&#8220;That the Parliament resolves to keep childcare at the top of the political agenda&#8221;,</p><p>as it says in the first line of the motion.</p><p>That is no mean feat. I hope that we will make good on that promise, because high-quality, affordable childcare can transform lives. It has a clear economic benefit, it has clear links to closing the educational achievement gap, it is central to gender equality and it is key to tackling child poverty. The issue lights the fire of the Labour Party, because it is at the heart of our pursuit of equality and social justice.</p><p>It is one thing to unite behind a single line in a motion; it is quite another to unite behind a long-term vision for childcare in Scotland, which carries the support of at least the two major parties in the Parliament. That is why the motion calls, again, for a cross-party Scottish childcare commission, which would set out a route map for the long term. I will return to that.</p><p>First, I want to spend a considerable amount of time focusing on the childcare policy that is outlined in the white paper, and on the various twists and turns that the policy has taken over the past six months. That needs to be on the Parliament&#8217;s record and it is a matter of regret that that has not happened before today. I have been truly shocked by the spin, the vacuity and the handling of statistics around the issue. I cannot make up my mind whether there has been wild incompetence or deliberate deception.</p><p>Regardless of that, let me go through each twist and turn. I do not intend to give way until I have got to the events of May, when I will happily accept an intervention&#8212;preferably an apology&#8212;from the minister.</p><p>First, let us look at the white paper. The approach to childcare is set out in three phases. In phase 1, 600 hours of childcare, for 50 per cent of two-year-olds, will be delivered in the first budget in an independent Scotland. In phase 2, all three and four-year-olds will get 1,140 hours of childcare a year by the end of the first parliamentary session. In phase 3, all children from age one to school age or five will be entitled to 1,140 hours of childcare.</p><p>According to the Scottish Government, the associated costs are &#163;100 million for phase 1 and &#163;700 million for phase 2. That includes no capital costs whatever. The Government has not published the cost of phase 3, but the Scottish Parliament information centre tells us that it will cost &#163;1.2 billion. Again, there are no capital costs associated with that phase.</p><p>When the Scottish National Party was asked where the &#163;700 million would come from, it said that it would come from the tax receipts of the 100,000 more women who would go into work. In January, the Government published the paper, &#8220;Childcare and Labour Market Participation: Economic Analysis&#8221;. Alex Salmond boasted that he had published that &#8220;very important&#8221; paper</p><p>&#8220;so that everybody can read and understand these things.&#8221;</p><p>However, the paper contains an interesting footnote, which says:</p><p>&#8220;Note the analysis below illustrates the impact of a boost in female participation rates rather than a specific policy. The specific proposal will have its own unique implications for the economy and budgetary impacts. These are not simulated here.&#8221;</p><p>Essentially, the Government had examined the impact of there being 100,000 more women in the labour market, but that had no direct or substantiated link with its own childcare policy.</p><p>On 6 March, the Institute for Fiscal Studies rang the alarm bells when it stated that there was little evidence that a major expansion of early learning and childcare would lead to tens of thousands more women getting jobs.</p><p>On 11 March, Tom Gordon from The Herald received confirmation in a freedom of information response that there was no modelling of the Government&#8217;s childcare policy. The response stated clearly that the Government&#8217;s modelling was of the impact of having more women in the workforce, not</p><p>&#8220;the impact of improved childcare itself.&#8221;</p><p>A separate FOI request sought details of how long the Government had given itself to get 100,000 more women into work. Was it one year, five years or 10 years? That FOI request was refused on public interest grounds. Let me read out the response. It states:</p><p>&#8220;We recognise that there is some public interest in release as part of open, transparent Government and to inform public debate. ... However, there is a stronger public interest in high quality policy-making, and in the properly considered implementation and development of policies, particularly on such a significant issue as childcare. This means that Ministers need a private space within which to obtain the best possible evidence and advice from officials to be able to consider all available options and to debate those rigorously, to fully understand their possible implications. Disclosing this advice and evidence while the childcare policy is still under discussion and development may undermine or constrain the Government&#8217;s ability to develop that policy effectively.&#8221;</p><p>While the Government was touring the country saying that only independence could deliver transformational childcare, officials in Victoria Quay were desperately trying to work out how it could be done.</p><p>However, it gets worse. On 2 April, SPICe published its paper on early learning and childcare. It revealed what many of us already thought: there are not enough women. As outlined right at the beginning, the SNP maths was based on 100,000 women who have kids under the age of five joining the labour market. However, there are only 64,000 economically inactive women and only 14,000 of those are actively looking for work.</p><p>The SPICe paper added that a rapid increase in the number of women joining the workforce might lead to suppressed wages. It states:</p><p>&#8220;This could have wider implications for the labour market and on incentives for women to enter the workforce.&#8221;</p><p>There is not just a problem with the number of women who have kids under the age of five and are looking for work. Another issue is the nature of that work. The calculations in the Government&#8217;s paper released in January are based on the median salary of both men and women&#8212;&#163;26,000 a year. However, the reality is that the median salary for women in Scotland is &#163;17,000, because so many women work part time.</p><p>When Alex Salmond was questioned about that on &#8220;Politics Scotland&#8221;, in both January and April, he cast that aside and arrogantly pointed to the employment statistics that show that 60,000 more women returned to work in the past year alone. In the January programme, he said:</p><p>&#8220;The vast overwhelming majority of these extra jobs are full time&#8221;.</p><p>In April&#8217;s programme, he said that they were &#8220;mostly &#8230; full-time jobs&#8221;. Neither of those statements was true, and in parliamentary questions that were asked in my name and answered by John Swinney they were demonstrated not to be true. The vast majority of those jobs were, in fact, part time on a two-to-one basis. The major boost to female employment statistics comes from women aged over 50 who are returning to work, not from young mums.</p><p>That matters, not simply because the First Minister misspoke, but because it fundamentally undermines the maths once again. Part-time workers pay less tax and tend to have low-paid jobs. What about those jobs? The idea that a young mum who has been out of work for three years can walk into a &#163;26,000 job is nonsense. I want transformational childcare for lone parents in Niddrie, Pilton, Wester Hailes and Gracemount. It is the lives of those women that I want to transform. Alex Salmond wants their votes.</p><p>Another, final twist came on 2 May, when the Government revealed, in response to an FOI request from Tom Gordon, that there was childcare modelling&#8212;it just would not be released. I will read out what the response said:</p><p>&#8220;While the strategic policy direction has been set out in the White Paper, detailed policy design work is continuing. The premature release of this detailed modelling-type work could be to the detriment of the full consideration of the entirety of the evidence and the options which underpin development of childcare policy. The modelling work forms only one part of a wider evidence base used to continue to develop this policy. Release of this information could therefore lead to a narrowly focused debate which may not allow for the measured consideration of all evidence on the best way to deliver the policy highlighted in the White Paper, and this would not be in the public interest.&#8221;</p><p>That is &#8220;Yes Minister&#8221; speak for, &#8220;We scribbled all over the fag packet and we still can&#8217;t make it add up.&#8221; Forget the public interest; it is clearly not in the minister&#8217;s interest for the information to be in the public domain. Let us get this absolutely clear&#8212;the Government refused to provide full workings for a paper that it published in January, which it published so that, in Alex Salmond&#8217;s words,</p><p>&#8220;everybody can read and understand these things.&#8221;</p><p>We were told that publishing some results in January was pertinent and a good thing, but that publishing all the results in May would be premature and a bad thing. We understand the Government&#8217;s childcare policy all right&#8212;we understand it to be an absolute shambles.</p><p>However, there is a road back. The Government could commit to a childcare commission and stop hijacking the debate on childcare for its own ends. The Labour Party has set up the every step campaign, and we have been touring the country asking parents for their first-hand experiences of childcare. We know that the quality and flexibility of childcare are just as important as the cost and we understand how important workforce issues are to parents. Parents care about what people who work with their kids in nurseries get paid, their terms and conditions and their qualifications.</p><p>We understand that childcare does not stop when kids go to school and that, if anything, the issues get worse. The SNP&#8217;s policy is based only on children who are three and four years old and some two-year-olds, but the challenge is much broader than that. Parents want wraparound care and they want more investment in breakfast clubs, but those are the two things that have faced the brunt of the Government&#8217;s cuts to local authority budgets. Parents want council services to be joined up, and they want their politicians to join up, too. I note that the minister&#8217;s amendment mentions my colleague Malcolm Chisholm and Willie Rennie. However, the Government can hardly boast about cross-party working when so much of the understanding of the Government&#8217;s approach has had to be unearthed through parliamentary questions and FOI requests, many of which have been rejected or avoided along the way.</p><p>I want transformational childcare. I want to transform the lives of the mums whom I meet regularly at rhymetime in Craigmillar library. There is no incentive for them to work just now. I do not want to send them into a low-paid poor job on a zero-hours contract. I want them to go to college first and get the skills that they missed out on in school, but they cannot do that because of the cuts that the Government has made to the colleges budget. The task is made all the harder by the fact that there are 93,000 fewer part-time places for women in our colleges than there were in 2007, with nearly a quarter of a million women being denied a place in further education over the past seven years. That is the Government&#8217;s responsibility.</p><p>I know that members on the Government benches share the passion to help those women get back into work. Those members see independence as the answer, but I believe that their proposal is in tatters. We need to get round the table and address the issue together. I see the ministers shaking their heads and saying that the proposal is not in tatters&#8212;they could not be more removed from reality. Their officials are telling them that they do not have the answers and that their policy is still in development, yet they sit and laugh. I find that truly shocking.</p><p>I look forward to the debate. Once again, let us take the politics out of this, get round the table and work out a long-term vision for childcare in Scotland that we can all get behind.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament resolves to keep childcare at the top of the political agenda regardless of the referendum result; believes that the SPICe briefing, Early Learning and Childcare, which was published 2 April 2014, has discredited the childcare claims made by the Scottish Government in the white paper on independence; notes that the Scottish Government has refused to publish its own economic modelling and, in the interests of transparency, calls on it to publish all of the information that the childcare claims in the white paper are based on; agrees that good quality, affordable and flexible childcare is essential in supporting many families; believes that all parties should work together on a long-term vision for childcare in Scotland and reach a consensus on the delivery, availability, affordability and financing of a comprehensive childcare strategy, and further believes that, to begin this work, a Scottish childcare commission with all-party support should be established.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-05-28", "body": "<p>Will Bob Doris give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/25083.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "image_width": 99, "person_id": "25083", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Kezia Dugdale", "member_id": "80505", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Lothian"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Neil", "last_name": "Findlay", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p></p><p>5.

That is what it is putting forward to the people of Scotland. It claims that we will be &#163;5 billion&#8212;&#163;1,000 per head&#8212;a year better off and, as a consequence of that, it is able to put forward the policies that it does.</p><p>It is time for a bit of realism from the Scottish Government, because the independent economists and analysts say that it is likely that we would be financially worse off as an independent Scotland and poorer than we would be if we were to remain part of the United Kingdom. Analysts will say that we would begin life in 2016-17 in a weaker financial position, and that that would become more challenging as time moves on.</p><p>That is probably why the white paper has figures for a single year only. If a business goes to a bank wanting to borrow &#163;1,000, it has to show a five-year business plan, but the Scottish Government thinks that it is acceptable to put forward one year&#8217;s figures when it is deciding to separate and break up a 300-year union.</p><p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies was very clear. It thought that the deficit that we would face would be 5.2 per cent of gross domestic product. On the other hand, the Scottish Government claims that our deficit would be 2.4 per cent, potentially up to 2.8 per cent. If the IFS is right&#8212;and most economists agree with it&#8212;we would need to have greater austerity in an independent Scotland than we would as part of the United Kingdom, regardless of who was in power at Westminster and here. The IFS said:</p><p>&#8220;the main conclusion of our analysis is that a significant further fiscal tightening would be required in Scotland, on top of that already announced by the UK government, in order to put Scotland&#8217;s long-term public finances onto a sustainable footing.&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Government has managed to give the impression that we would be richer by doing two things. The first has been by looking back into the past and talking about what would have happened five or 10 years ago instead of talking about what will happen in 2016, were we to be independent. The second thing that it has done is to assume that we could have only a high oil price and production scenario, which is a completely false prospectus. Anyone anywhere knows that that is very unlikely to happen year in, year out.</p><p>In its financial paper, instead of looking at what it thought the finances would be, the Scottish Government&#8217;s starting point was, &#8220;We have to show that we would be better off than the rest of the UK.&#8221; It then put in the figures to try to prove that that would be the case. The only figures in its financial paper assume what it calls scenario 4 for oil. It discards any other potential scenario for oil. In its paper, of course, it makes it look as though we would be better off and that we would have more money to spend, but that works only if we pull in &#163;7 billion in oil revenues in year 1, &#163;7.3 billion in year 2, and &#163;7 billion after that. That was the question that Lewis Macdonald put to the First Minister during his opening remarks&#8212;what would the tax revenues from oil be like? The First Minister spent two minutes responding to the question on oil revenues, but he did not come anywhere near answering it.</p><p>Nobody out there&#8212;not a single person&#8212;agrees with Alex Salmond&#8217;s figures on future revenues from oil.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>The First Minister would not give way to me, but I will gladly give way to him.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>I do not know why members are clapping.

I am extremely grateful to Professor Gavin McEwen, who gave expert advice to the Finance Committee, and to all other stakeholders who participated in round-table discussions, gave formal evidence and wrote in to try to explain some of the finer complexities of tax.</p><p>Iain Gray quite rightly quoted Smith&#8217;s maxims. All those maxims have great merit on their own, but it has been very interesting to see that it is far trickier to obey them all at the same time in practice than in theory.</p><p>Although there was praise for most of the bill at stage 1, the biggest criticism that was made related to the provisions on penalties. Things had not been done quite rightly in that area and there was a strong view among stakeholders that the circumstances, amounts and factors to be taken into account ought to be on the face of the bill, and that procedure and administration could be left to secondary legislation. The bill team and the cabinet secretary acknowledged that during stage 1 and, helpfully and rightly, the cabinet secretary lodged a raft of amendments at stage 2.</p><p>The penalties provisions are now far clearer and have far broader support than they would have had if they had been left as they were at stage 1. For example, section 150, on failure to make a return, previously had no amount attached and simply gave the Government the power to produce regulations. Now, after amendments were agreed to at stage 2, firm amounts have been put against what would be paid in the absence of a return. The provisions have been helpfully divided into time periods: returns that are three, six or 12 months late will be treated differently and receive different penalties. Also, penalties have been split between the two taxes: the regime for land and buildings transaction tax is slightly different from that for landfill tax. Section 150 now does what it ought to do and gives some certainty, but, as the cabinet secretary said, the bill still allows the Government a degree of flexibility to make changes by order, should circumstances prove that to be necessary.</p><p>Another example relates to section 160, which is about penalties for an error in the tax return. Previously no penalty amount was set out; it was simply the case that regulations could be brought forward at some point. Now a clear percentage has been set out on what the penalty might be in relation to the tax. Indeed, it is quite helpful that the bill now splits the penalty into two categories: one for deliberate inaccuracies by the person completing the return; and one for inaccuracies that are deemed to be careless as opposed to deliberate. Those two categories are treated separately, as most people would argue they ought to be.</p><p>We now have consistency: the regime hangs together and makes sense to taxpayers. All those changes were welcomed when they were made and I welcome them again.</p><p>During this afternoon&#8217;s discussion of amendments, the cabinet secretary touched on the issue of a penalty for failure to pay tax. Everyone in the chamber agreed to today&#8217;s amendments in that regard. Previously, I had some concerns over the provision: there would have been, in effect, an instant penalty if the tax was not paid on or before the due date, which was a little harsh. The cabinet secretary agreed to reflect on the matter, and what has emerged is a good set of amendments that we considered today. They provide that, at least in the case of LBTT, taxpayers will have 30 days to pay the penalty.</p><p>There was criticism of the proposals for a charter of standards and values. The bill as introduced seemed to put a slightly greater obligation on the taxpayer than it did on revenue Scotland. Taxpayers had to obey; revenue Scotland had to &#8220;aspire&#8221; to the standards in the charter. The Government changed the wording, quite rightly, to provide that both sides must &#8220;adhere&#8221; to the charter. There will be reciprocity, as opposed to the balance being in favour of revenue Scotland.</p><p>Both the committees that considered the bill thought that ministerial guidance to revenue Scotland must be made public. That, too, has been provided for in an amendment that we considered today, which makes it clear that ministerial guidance will be laid before the Parliament.</p><p>The bill started well and has been improved, as the cabinet secretary said. We will happily support it at decision time.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>If that was John Mason being optimistic about the tax system, I hope that I am not here on the day when he is pessimistic.</p><p>Quite rightly, this has been a broadly consensual debate, with little to divide the chamber, either at stage 2 or at stage 3.</p><p>I was struck by something that the cabinet secretary said earlier. He pointed out just how much subordinate legislation will have to flow from not only this bill but the other tax bills that we passed earlier this year and at the end of last year. For all three, there is bound to be a raft of legislation. In some ways, today is only a starting point. There is more work to be done than we have done so far, and all of it has to be completed by 1 April next year. There is a huge amount to be done over the coming months by the Government, the Parliament and all those who are involved in taxation in Scotland.</p><p>Probably the first true test of revenue Scotland&#8217;s performance and way of doing business will involve the charter to which the cabinet secretary referred. Under section 10 of the bill, revenue Scotland has to create a charter of standards and values. As I indicated earlier, the section has been boosted by bringing in reciprocity between revenue Scotland and taxpayers. In pulling the charter together, revenue Scotland is to consult those whom it thinks are relevant. That will be its first challenge: how will it consult on what the charter ought to look like, who will it consult and will it take a proactive or a reactive approach? Everybody will be watching very carefully, because how the charter is constructed will tee up how revenue Scotland performs over the coming years.</p><p>I do not know whether there is information on this at the moment, but if the cabinet secretary has any information on the timing of the consultation on the charter we would certainly welcome hearing it in the chamber today.</p><p>I have a couple of other points to bring up. Section 3 refers to revenue Scotland&#8217;s resolution of disputes with taxpayers. The section contains the phrase &#8220;including by mediation&#8221;. Individual cases between taxpayers and revenue Scotland will clearly be operational matters and decisions on them will, quite rightly, be for revenue Scotland to take. However, I wonder whether including that phrase is a hint or a steer from the Government that, as a policy, it would like to see mediation being used by revenue Scotland. Perhaps I have read too much into that. I would certainly welcome any clarification on it from the Government.</p><p>A couple of members have talked about the block grant adjustment mechanism. This is not strictly and directly part of the stage 3 debate, but the cabinet secretary gave evidence to the Finance Committee last Wednesday about how things have moved forward in that regard. Perhaps the answer to this question is no, given that that was only a week ago, but has anything happened in the interim period and is there anything else that the cabinet secretary can share with the Parliament, so that we can see that process moving forward as fast as possible? That adjustment mechanism must be sorted out in the coming months, but everything else underpinning the bill&#8212;and indeed the other two tax bills&#8212;must be in place by 1 April next year. There is much for us all to do in the coming months.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Bill"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>I, too, congratulate Gordon MacDonald on securing the debate. I thank the Scottish Grocers Federation, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents and the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust for their helpful briefings, which I think that many members will have taken advantage of in preparing for the debate.</p><p>We are right to talk about the enormous contribution that independent retailers make to the economy. Figures have been put out there already, but they are worth repeating&#8212;41,000 people across Scotland are employed in the sector and there are 5,500 stores.</p><p>Most important, those stores have a multiplier effect. We heard about the statistics on investment in stores; that leads on to local trades, shopfitters and suppliers in the local area. It is a fact that a far higher percentage of each pound that is spent in a local retailer circulates back to the local economy in comparison with spending at an out-of-town centre or online.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch touched on my next point. I do not know whether it is by accident or design, but the number of people who get their first job&#8212;their first opportunity on the employment ladder&#8212;in some kind of independent retailer is remarkable. That should be recognised and applauded.</p><p>Independent retailers contribute nationally and locally, but they are more than that&#8212;they are community hubs wherever they happen to be located. We read in the briefings about in-store post offices, ATMs and bill payment services. Gordon MacDonald touched on the fact that many such stores have become the main source of advertising for the community.</p><p>If people want to find out when the gala day is and what is happening, who the best local supplier is to speak to for whatever trade, or what classes or training events are on, their local retailer is very often the first&#8212;and best&#8212;port of call. Many retailers put up that information for free but even those that charge do so for very reasonable and fair rates.</p><p>Although I have no scientific evidence to back this up&#8212;only personal experience&#8212;I believe that those who own and operate independent retailers in their communities are far more likely to be involved in, or indeed to run, their local community councils. When we wrap all that together, independent retailers genuinely give back in a way that many other businesses either do not or do far less of.</p><p>Some of the challenges that the sector faces have been touched on, but others have not so I will move on to them. As regards the challenges that are mentioned by businesses, the challenge of business rates is very near the top of the pile. The Scottish Government should be applauded for the small business bonus. We supported the bonus from day 1, we encouraged the Government to accelerate it, and it has been a resounding success.</p><p>The question for the minister and for all of us now is: where next with the small business bonus? Can we raise the threshold so that more local retailers come in underneath the threshold and benefit from it? Can we have more of a stepped system so that, if a retailer is just above the threshold, they do not miss out entirely and they still get some benefit from the small business bonus? Is there something that we can do to slow down the rises in business rates? I do not offer all the answers, but they are questions that we all have to think about.</p><p>I know that the minister has form on regulation, particularly in his previous role. Retailers have been hit by tobacco, alcohol and indeed environmental burdens. Some businesses have been hit by one of those burdens; many independent retailers have been hit by all three over a fairly short space of time. Is there something that we can do to reduce the burden of regulation on them? It is more difficult to comply with regulations as a smaller business than it is for far larger businesses.</p><p>Can we do more to help independent retailers on the issue of illicit trade? The Scottish Grocers Federation hosted an excellent session on the issue in the Parliament just a couple of months ago. Illicit trade damages legitimate businesses, harms consumers and helps those who are trying to get round the rules.</p><p>Any responses to those issues that the minister can touch on will be gratefully received.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Independent Retailers"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>The official Scottish Government pensions paper contains 30 key proposals but only four of those proposals are costed.

The official Scottish Government position, as set out by Mr Swinney yet again last week, is that if we do not get a currency union we will simply walk away from the entirety of the debt. It is one thing for a politician to be a bit reckless and say something like that, but it is quite another for economists to say it. The question that I put to Mr Swinney in my intervention was very specific: do all members of the fiscal commission working group, including its two Nobel laureates, support that particular argument?</p><p>We know that the fiscal commission working group has recommended a currency union, but that was not the question that I asked. Does the working group support the Scottish Government&#8217;s assertion that Scotland could simply walk away from the entirety of the debt were there not to be a currency union? I have read the fiscal commission working group&#8217;s reports and published statements, and the minutes of its meetings, and I have not been able to trace anywhere a specific comment from the group saying that all its members think that that assertion is a logical, intelligent or even correct thing to say or do.</p><p>I understand&#8212;at least it was reported in the press at the weekend&#8212;that the chair of the fiscal commission working group will give a keynote speech on Monday of next week.

The stark stats in the Buglife briefing tell us that 84 per cent of EU crops rely on insect pollinators. We can sometimes suffer from a focus on direct economic gain in this area, and we really must widen that. Many of the efforts that I have seen to look after the health of bees end up with a focus on honey bees. Honey bees and the beekeeping, honey-producing economy are important, but we must not be tricked into thinking that keeping the honey bees healthy means that we will be keeping our pollinator population at large healthy. The majority of pollination is by wild pollinators such as bumblebees or the 250 other species of bee in the UK, as well as flies, moths, wasps, beetles and butterflies. Many of our pollinators are in crisis, and that is no surprise when they have lost so much natural habitat in the past 60 years, including 97 per cent of wildflower meadows.</p><p>Pollination is one of those processes that are largely hidden from the public consciousness. The insects just get on with it and we enjoy the fruits, flowers and food of their labour. However, if we lose our pollinators, we might lose many of the plants that they pollinate and the animals that rely on them. The impact on the food chain would make sustaining the global human population massively challenging.</p><p>The campaign over the past few years to ban neonicotinoids&#8212;a highly damaging class of neurotoxins&#8212;was heartening but also infuriating. Millions of people joined organisations such as the Scottish Wildlife Trust and others to protect our pollinators after scientific evidence showed the effect that such nerve agents were having on pollinators, and the EU has put in place a temporary two-year ban for three of the most damaging insecticides. However, the big pesticide companies such as Bayer CropScience and Syngenta are continuing with cynical attempts to pursue short-term profit at the expense of the health of the agricultural economy, and indeed our health.</p><p>The precautionary principle states:</p><p>&#8220;Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.&#8221;</p><p>As Friends of the Earth says, our pollinators are seriously</p><p>&#8220;under assault from pesticides and intensive farming.&#8221;</p><p>We do not know what will happen after the two-year ban is up, but along with my colleague Angus MacDonald I urge the cabinet secretary to continue the ban that is currently in place.

David Cameron&#8217;s use of the words &#8220;scrounger&#8221; and &#8220;shirker&#8221; to describe people who receive support is divisive and is an attempt to legitimise his Government&#8217;s reforms, which have not focused on the welfare and mental health of the people who are in most need, or on the urgent need to address inequality in our society.</p><p>All MSPs received a welcome flood of briefings for the debate. The one from Engender stuck out. Its shocking headline figure is:</p><p>&#8220;Since 2010, 74% of cuts to benefits, tax credits, pay and pensions have been taken from women.&#8221;</p><p>It points out that</p><p>&#8220;This rises to 81% of the &#8216;savings&#8217; realised by the Treasury in 2014-15.&#8221;</p><p>It is clear that women are being hit by a gendered austerity. Engender points out that UK welfare reform has just exacerbated the gender inequality that is already pervasive in society.</p><p>The Fawcett Society has identified three main ways in which women chiefly are being hit by the cuts: through the loss of benefits and services, through the loss of public sector jobs and because, as state services are withdrawn, women will have to fill in the gap and take up further care and community responsibilities. It is hard to believe that the gender pay gap in Scotland is 13 per cent for full-time work and 34 per cent for part-time work. Women, who predominantly still manage caring duties, probably cannot find enough hours in the week or extra hours from their employer to bring their wages into line with those of their male counterparts.</p><p>Employment law is still reserved to Westminster. Why has so little progress been made? On average, women do four hours and 15 minutes of unpaid work a day, compared with men&#8217;s two hours and 18 minutes. Some 40 per cent of women in employment rely on relatives for childcare&#8212;a majority of them are female&#8212;and one in four women in her 50s is caring for a disabled or frail elderly relative.

One is a contributions-based scheme that the expert group described as</p><p>&#8220;a highly individual approach ... tying benefits to personal contributions and savings.&#8221;</p><p>That requires the complexity of means testing and constant assessment to ensure that nobody gets more than they need. The other vision is a universal one that abandons means testing and complexity and provides a citizen&#8217;s basic income to everyone.</p><p>Professor Ailsa McKay, who was a member of the expert group, was a feminist economist and lifelong advocate of that universal approach. She sadly passed away before the publication of the report, and is greatly missed by her family and friends. However, I have no doubt at all that her contribution to the welfare debate will continue. The University of Glasgow is advertising for someone to fill the newly created Ailsa McKay postdoctoral research fellowship in economics to further research the relationship between a citizen&#8217;s income and gender equality.</p><p>A citizen&#8217;s income is the foundation of the Green vision for social security. This week, the Green yes campaign has published a new paper that demonstrates how a citizen&#8217;s income could work and be paid for in Scotland. I thank John Mason for his open-minded comments regarding the citizen&#8217;s income and a certain level of unconditionality. It is not a perfect proposal, but it is designed to demonstrate how Scotland can begin on its journey towards rebuilding a fair welfare system that has universality at its core. The modelling that we have done with David Comerford of the University of Stirling demonstrates how Scotland could join the ranks of the most equal countries in the world.</p><p>Under the citizen&#8217;s income proposal, 70 per cent of the lowest-earning households would be better off, with the highest-earning households losing only 11 per cent of their income. The citizen&#8217;s income is a simple idea that could reduce inequality, promote solidarity and allow each of us to make our own decisions about working, caring, learning and creating without ending up on the breadline.</p><p>While we consider introducing a citizen&#8217;s income, we can currently crack down on tax dodging by corporations and rich individuals, and we can call for an end to the inhuman sanctions regime that has led to hundreds of thousands of people relying on food banks or applying in desperation for hardship or crisis loans.

They were a success because of our fascination with those who dedicate time, blood, sweat, tears and&#8212;often&#8212;cash to being the best that they can be in their chosen sports.</p><p>I know that we will all have our own personal memories and stories from the games. As someone who has been involved in sport since her earliest years, I attended a few events, which really were very special. George Adam may be slightly disturbed to learn that I was one of the very lucky ones in the ballot who was fortunate to be able to attend several events. If I had been organised, I might have stayed in the city, but I would have had to book accommodation before it was all booked up. However, if I had stayed in the city, I would have missed some of the memorable travel moments that Sandra White touched on.</p><p>Steve Montgomery, who is the managing director of ScotRail, could regularly be found mingling with the Glasgow Central rail queue&#8212;it was quite a queue at times, but a really well-managed and good-tempered one&#8212;offering advice on the most sensible way to get back to Edinburgh on a given evening. I did not see him there only once or twice. Taking his advice, I chose Glasgow Central rather than Queen Street station as a departure point, which meant that I enjoyed the deadpan delivery of the cross-country train guard who solemnly announced, as a prelude to other catering news, &#8220;There is no rooftop garden on this train.&#8221; There was also the Mount Florida station announcer who updated the hundreds returning from Hampden Park on the latest medal tally and his take on national characteristics. I do not think that I can share that with members, but he could certainly give a few Edinburgh fringe stars a lesson in timing and delivery.</p><p>Glasgow embraced the games and, as the days passed, the feeling of pride and enjoyment in what the city and its people added to the spectacle simply grew. I was privileged to attend hockey, netball, track cycling and athletics. The warmth, humour and desire to help visitors and spectators get to where they needed to be were palpable. Those who delivered the games had clearly learned much from the London blueprint; the games there were a huge success, as were Glasgow&#8217;s.</p><p>Glasgow 2014 brought together people from around the globe in a way that only sport can. Spectators cheered on their own countryfolk, but the applause from the crowd for each and every athlete and their endeavour is testament to the generous and knowledgeable audience that Glasgow attracted. The crowd defied definition. From babes in arms to our oldest citizens, folks of all shapes, sizes, nationalities and walks of life cheered every individual, regardless of outcome or level of celebrity.</p><p>I was really chuffed by Eilidh Child&#8217;s silver; Mark Dry&#8217;s bronze; Lynsey Sharp&#8217;s determination to achieve; Guy Learmonth&#8217;s personal best in the 800m final, which was a real highlight; Eilish McColgan&#8217;s gutsy run; Beth Potter&#8217;s 10,000m personal best; and Emily Dudgeon, who narrowly missed out on the 800m final after a fantastic performance. There were far too many great performances to mention them all. However, medals and records aside, it is the endeavour of those who performed that matters, including those who may have to wait until next time and those who will have to go back to the drawing board. That is what makes the games what they are, and what makes them so special.</p><p>I have no doubt that many people, young and old, will be inspired to follow in the footsteps of those they cheered on; there were sports for all ages and inclinations on show. Jo Pavey&#8217;s 5,000m bronze medal in her fifth decade, and months after giving birth will spur on many a middle-aged runner, and seeing bowls being played by rising youngsters will have an impact, too.</p><p>There are questions posed by the games, however. How can our part-time netball and hockey players compete with full-time professional athletes? Which sports should receive more funding? We need to look even more closely at formal links between our top coaches and our earliest educators in schools. Physical education and games are not the same thing, and we need to invest in physical literacy for our young people, because that will pay dividends in terms of their long-term health and wellbeing, self-confidence and enjoyment of sport.</p><p>The challenge now is to deliver a truly meaningful legacy. Part of that legacy is visible: it is the velodrome, the rest of the Emirates arena and the housing, with its district heating scheme.</p><p>However, it is not just about facilities in Glasgow: this is a nationwide issue. Let us ensure that the facilities are properly maintained, that we proudly take care of them and that we learn lessons from what happened at Meadowbank in Edinburgh. Bob Doris was right to highlight community sports delivery as an important model. The other part of the challenge is to ensure that those who would like to use the facilities have access to them, that they are affordable, that we have enough coaches in place and that no one is priced out of a more active lifestyle. Let us look at good practice, such as Scottish Athletics&#8217; club together programme, which is about partnership and building a meaningful legacy from the grass roots up.</p><p>The games do not take place in a vacuum. The world watched, and Scotland&#8217;s message of equality was clear and heartfelt. The inclusion of para-sport made the games even better. Pride house played an important role, and I was proud to be a patron. The impact of Pride house, which was in a central location, cannot be overstated and I thank and congratulate the board, the volunteers and all those who supported this public sign of our support for the lesbian, gay and bisexual community.

I, too, thank the committee members, and the clerks who supported them in their deliberations.</p><p>As an Edinburgh councillor, I visited Portobello high school and was, frankly, appalled by the condition of the building. Learning and teaching in that poorly designed and poorly maintained building is needlessly challenging. If Portobello high school had been properly designed in the first place and had been allocated a meaningful life-cycle maintenance budget, we might not be here today. I know that those who oppose building on the park also whole-heartedly agree that Portobello needs a new school. Passions have run high in this debate because our parks and our schools are among our most precious and most important community assets, and the local community concerned cares deeply about those assets.</p><p>The City of Edinburgh Council obtained advice from senior counsel in 2008 that advised the council to seek the court&#8217;s permission to appropriate Portobello park before taking any further action. However, that expert advice was not made known publicly and has come to light only as a result of a freedom of information request. The council should have established, without a shadow of a doubt, that it could build on the park. Offers to share costs to do so were not taken up, and the on-going lack of clarity lengthened the debate around the future of the school and the park by some years.</p><p>We are now years down the line and we must ensure the best possible outcome for the entire community. My amendment committing the City of Edinburgh Council to provide an area of replacement parkland for that lost if the bill is enacted was not selected for the debate this afternoon, but it can been seen in Tuesday&#8217;s Business Bulletin. The people of Portobello want and need a new high school where their young people can flourish and learn. The people of Portobello also need certainty that their environment and quality of life will not be diminished. I fully understand why there are community concerns around that issue. The City of Edinburgh Council has changed its mind previously regarding the provision of replacement open space, so making that part of the bill&#8217;s provisions would provide greater protection and recognition at a national level.</p><p>That said, Green councillors in the City of Edinburgh Council have ensured, via an addendum that was lodged, that the council will secure the replacement park with Fields in Trust status. As I said, I sit on the Fields in Trust Scotland board and I am reassured that Fields in Trust protection is formally being processed with the City of Edinburgh Council for both the golf course at Portobello park and the new open area that will be where the school currently stands. It is worth noting that there has been no challenge to any site protected by Fields in Trust since it was formed in the 1920s and that it has always successfully negotiated for appropriate replacement provision in cases in which councils have approached it.</p><p>I will support the bill at this final stage. Although they are not part of the bill&#8217;s provisions, there are assurances in place for the replacement park. I welcome the consideration stage amendment from Alison McInnes on protecting the land&#8217;s legal status should it cease to be used for education. There are lessons to learned from this experience and process, not least about how we design our schools in the first place. Are we seriously maintaining them? Are we putting funds aside to ensure that they do not deteriorate to the state that Portobello high school finds itself in?</p><p>I look forward to the arrival of a school that pupils in Portobello deserve and the community can be proud of. I look forward, too, to the provision of quality open space that will genuinely enhance the quality of life of people in Portobello.

One person&#8217;s idea of a good place to live will be different from another&#8217;s but those are some basic, entry-level things that planning should deliver.</p><p>Land-use planning is a profession for a reason. To balance all the demands on our land is a difficult art, particularly when we are not in control of the building itself. However, just because it is a profession does not mean that the experts have all the answers&#8212;far from it. Land-use planning should be done by people who live on the land. We should not be frightened of opening up such decision making. Of course architects and developers have an important role in that, but so do the people who will live in and alongside the houses that they build.</p><p>What holds us back from a step change in public engagement? The Involve Foundation and the Royal Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce tell us in &#8220;From Fairy Tale to Reality: Dispelling the Myths around Citizen Engagement&#8221; that those myths trap us in a way of thinking that says that public engagement is too expensive and too difficult and that people are not up for it.

Housing targets in the plan mean that more land is to be zoned, but the targets are bloated by a 10 per cent generosity margin. Take away the fat and the generosity, and the need to sacrifice the green belt at Cammo and Curriemuirend vanishes. People are understandably incredulous and often angry that their views are ignored and that estimated housing numbers from a desktop study are given precedence.</p><p>Edinburgh needs more homes, but the spread of the suburbs and executive housing will not meet that need.

That is true to an extent, but the housing forecasts are done with a Government tool and signed off as credible by the Government.</p><p>The Government has the last word and is enforcing it, but that creates a local development plan that meets developers&#8217; needs, not real people&#8217;s housing needs&#8212;that is the issue.</p><p>I am sure that the minister understands that the argument that more new supply will reduce house prices is nonsense, because new supply is only a fraction of overall supply and makes very little difference to price.

Scrutiny of how we are going to pay for it is welcome&#8212;obviously, the finances are important if any Government is to deliver on promises. I welcome the fact that the issue is getting the attention that it needs and merits, because it is fair to say that it has not had that until now.</p><p>I hope that we can see the debate in the round, as being about the care of children rather than childcare. Public policy should be able to help parents to ensure that their children have the best start in life. Increases in the amount of institutional nursery childcare that is available from local authorities will be welcomed by parents who struggle to afford to pay for additional hours. We all know that childcare costs here are among the highest in Europe.</p><p>There are other types of childcare, many of which are playing second fiddle in the debate but should not be forgotten. Informal care by friends and family is the most obvious example. Throughout human history, we have raised children by sharing responsibility among friends and family. That type of care has immense value, although it is not measured in economic terms, as Clare Adamson mentioned. Any public policy that we promote should welcome and recognise the important role of informal care.</p><p>For all sorts of reasons, many parents do not have such a network to tap into, so they look outside that circle. Just who by and where our children will be looked after is a massively important decision for any parent or carer. Many of us will have visited nurseries and childminders before coming to a decision, although many people experience a limited range of options&#8212;or no options&#8212;as well as limited availability for certain days, waiting lists and shortages, which necessitate increased travel, expense and inconvenience and make a long day even longer for parents and children.</p><p>It remains the case, however, that it is often easier to secure a nursery place for a younger child than it is to secure childcare that fits round the school day and makes working life possible for those with school-age children. Childcare is essential for those with children who juggle work and family life, and it can be challenging to find the right place or person to provide it. Fees can sometimes be comparable to mortgage payments and beyond consideration, particularly for those with more than one child. As I said, fees are particularly high in this country, yet that is not reflected in the pay packets of those who deliver the care, even though their job is surely one of the most important that anyone could do. I agree whole-heartedly with the comments of Mary Scanlon and Ken Macintosh on that.</p><p>One size does not fit all. We need various flexible models of childcare that reflect that and address local challenges, but we need quality assurance, too, and mutual commitments to standardise excellence across the board. Day care should be part of a full childhood and not simply somewhere to park children when we head to work. It should be delivered by highly qualified, well-paid and valued staff and it should be such a positive offering that it will be taken up even when there is a parent at home.</p><p>The Food Standards Agency has suggested that 15 per cent of Scottish homes do not have cutlery. Quality childcare can introduce children to important life skills. Many children do not eat at the table and are not introduced to a knife and fork at home. We can look to the Copenhagen House of Food model and make good food habits an important part of a quality education.</p><p>We can address our children&#8217;s lack of physical activity from the youngest age by making the outdoors accessible all year round. We can make days when children spend wet breaks indoors a thing of the past. We could stock nurseries and schools with waterproofs and wellies for all children. Our children are not as fit or physically literate as they used to be, and we are paying the price. We need to build links with sport governing bodies and introduce our nursery children to gymnastics and athletics&#8212;the basis of physical literacy&#8212;at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Childcare needs to be educational, affordable and universal. If we achieve that transformation, we will enable the many women who wish to work to achieve their potential and realise their ambitions. As Professor Sara Carter has noted, if the level of business ownership among women matched that among their male counterparts, we would have more than 108,000 additional businesses in Scotland. However, as the Scottish Trades Union Congress has advised, many women choose economic inactivity when faced with high childcare costs and a lack of appealing choices. That inactivity can impact on career progression and on the value of women&#8217;s pensions when they reach retirement age.</p><p>Single parents face particular challenges accessing childcare and making budgets balance. The great majority of single parents are women and, while children are young, there is a marked difference between the number of lone parents working and the number of women with partners working.</p><p>Women make up the overwhelming number of those working in childcare. Childcare has one of the biggest gender imbalances among staff and it is important that we address that. Norway has set targets for male educators and has provided extra support to help with those targets, along with job advertising and recruiting campaigns. Sweden is also often quoted in this debate. In the 1970s, less than 10 per cent of pre-schoolers in Sweden could access a publicly funded place. Their parents took to the streets.</p><p>We need to recognise the important role of childminders. They look after 30,000 children in Scotland and, in too many areas, they are a preciously rare resource. We need to ensure that we offer the support that will encourage more people to consider childminding as a career.</p><p>We must think about where our childcare buildings are located. Large institutions, colleges and universities should offer childcare provision for staff. This Parliament should consider such provision. There is a private nursery in a local college, but it is too expensive for the young mums who study there. That does not make sense.</p><p>We cannot achieve this transformation overnight, but we can achieve it.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-05-21", "body": "<p></p><p>5.

I will be honest. There were other events on in the Parliament that night and I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go and talk about potatoes all night.&#8221; However, it was genuinely one of the most interesting meetings that I have ever been to in the Parliament and I left it a complete convert to the value of Scottish produce and the importance of potatoes, which we hardly ever talk about in the Parliament or, I would argue, do enough to promote.</p><p>Potatoes are affordable, environmentally friendly, a staple of a healthy diet, nutritious, and a leading Scottish product. I will admit to being teased about holding a potato debate this evening, but we need only look at Scottish potato exports. In the Parliament, we frequently talk about whisky and salmon as leading Scottish exports, which have targets to increase their global reach, and yet Scotland is the second biggest producer of seed potatoes in Europe. Almost 30 per cent of seed potatoes grown in Scotland are exported to EU and non-EU countries. We export to more than 40 countries, including Egypt and Morocco. That is quite impressive, but we do not talk about our exports or our global importance in that area.</p><p>We are not always grateful for Scotland&#8217;s weather but we have a great combination of soil and weather for producing a world-leading product&#8212;a product that many other countries rely on. At a time when we talk a lot about food security, potatoes are an important cornerstone of Scottish produce. We should be looking at ways to support and grow the sector. Like all areas of farming, there are yearly challenges and fluctuations in price and productivity, but in 2012 the estimated value of potatoes was &#163;160 million. Eighty per cent of all British seed potatoes are grown in Scotland, with a sector value of around &#163;100 million. It is a significant sector and a Scottish success story that we should celebrate.</p><p>I mentioned food security, but we could look at other global challenges, such as sustainability and addressing climate change. Food chains and production have a significant role to play in addressing those challenges.</p><p>Potatoes that are grown in Britain use just 29 per cent of the average amount of water consumed by the crop across the rest of the globe. The journey from field to plate is much shorter than it is for other comparable produce. If we think about the water, energy and air miles that are used to produce rice and pasta, we can see that potatoes compare very favourably. Work is, however, being done for the future. The James Hutton Institute is investing in research for the sector and developing varieties that require less fertiliser and water input, and so can be grown with a smaller environmental footprint. Potatoes that can withstand environmental pressures are good for the export market but they are also good for futureproofing our own produce against the impact of climate change at home.</p><p>However, the potato sector is facing significant challenges. Consumption has fallen across the United Kingdom, but more significantly within Scotland. Since February 2012, consumption of fresh potatoes in Scotland has fallen by 13 per cent compared to 9 per cent in England and 10 per cent in Wales.</p><p>We can suggest several reasons for that. Our eating habits have changed. We have seen an increase in the use of pasta, rice and noodles; we have many more options than we did generations ago, when meat and potatoes were the staples. Lifestyles have also changed: we lead busy lives combined with less meal preparation. When someone gets home from work, potatoes might not seem like the obvious thing to cook, if they plan to cook at all. The impression is that they take a while to prepare, but supermarkets and producers are trying to respond to that with more convenient but fresh produce options. Product development is trying to address the issues of consumption.</p><p>We have also seen a shift in the type of potatoes that we buy. We are in new potato season, and I hope that members will come along to the Potato Council event at lunch time tomorrow and try some new season potatoes. They will be most welcome. The consumer is increasingly buying smaller potatoes and smaller bags. Although that might help with consumption figures, it leaves the Scottish potato market vulnerable and too seasonally focused.</p><p>Research also has a significant role to play. We all like good-looking fruit and veg these days. Although there is a job to do with the consumer accepting produce that looks like it has actually been grown in a field, there are also advantages to improving the appearance and nutritional profile, reducing greening and sprouting, and developing better flavour. All those issues can contribute to how we increase consumption.</p><p>Of course, there is always the perception that potatoes make us fat. That is probably one of the most difficult myths to address and reverse. Starchy foods are our main source of carbohydrate and are important in a healthy diet, but the idea that potatoes are heavy in calories persists. When I spoke to people about the debate, I was surprised by how many people still have that impression. It is often not the potato, but the butter, the oil, or the salt that we add that is the problem. Potatoes with skins on are a great source of energy, fibre, B vitamins and potassium, as well as vitamin C. The UK Department of Health has recently changed its dietary advice to include potatoes with skins, along with wholegrains, as a source of fibre.</p><p>There is, however, no defined portion size for potato in the UK, unlike the 80g that is recommended for fruit and vegetables. It would be good to have clarity on that because it would help with the promotion of healthy eating guidance to consumers. If it was true that potatoes caused weight gain, we would not necessarily see falling consumption alongside increasing obesity figures.</p><p>Last year, I asked the Minister for Public Health about the goal of increasing potato consumption by 25 per cent, a target that was in the preventing overweight and obesity in Scotland route map, and then removed on the basis of advice from the Food Standards Agency. I understand the reasons for changing the advice, but it creates a confusing message for the consumer. I accept that part of that is the difficulty caused by the lack of an evidence base about health benefits, but that needs to be resolved and a clear message given about the nutritious value of potatoes and the role that they play in a healthy diet. While no one denies their value, potatoes miss out on positive promotion as they are not part of the five-a-day message, and they miss out on positive promotion as a starchy carbohydrate because they are not a wholegrain, which tend to be the focus in that category.</p><p>Potatoes are affordable. We have seen an increase in cost in recent years, but we have seen an increase in food prices across the shopping basket. Food prices are predicted to rise faster than incomes every year until 2018. There is significant pressure on global food prices and feeding a family gets more difficult. Potatoes remain an affordable product and one that people can grow themselves. I know that the Potato Council, as well as representing the sector, has been doing a lot of work with schools and has been supporting them through the grow your own potatoes project.</p><p>This year marks the 70th anniversary of the D-day landings and the British Nutrition Foundation is using that opportunity to highlight the potato with what it describes as new nutritional insights into an old wartime food hero. Potatoes can seem old-fashioned and the consumption figures that I mentioned are even starker when we see that consumption is falling much faster among under-40s.</p><p>Bearing in mind the global food challenges that we face, and issues such as affordability, nutrition, sustainability and the environment, I believe that we have a Scottish product that we should celebrate and be proud of.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Potatoes"}, {"date": "2014-06-04", "body": "<p>Does the member agree that although we know about the different varieties there should be more variety in our supermarkets and that part of the way to address the problem of consumption is to give the consumer much greater choice in the potatoes that they consume?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Potatoes"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p></p><p>5.

I have tried to have the subject selected for topical questions over the past few weeks, so I am glad that the minister has recognised the seriousness of the situation and has used Government time to debate it. It is an emotive subject that has gathered a significant amount of attention from organisations and the wider public. I am pleased that we have the opportunity today to discuss wildlife crime and how we can work together to ensure that we do not continue to be faced with the unacceptable deaths of our iconic birds. I fully support the minister&#8217;s comments in his opening speech.</p><p>The reaction to the latest raptor deaths, from the demonstration in Inverness to the donations that have been received by RSPB Scotland, should make everyone within the chamber pause and reflect on the impact that the deaths are having not just on our wildlife, but on the image of Scotland and the value that we place on our environment. Nature-based tourism is worth some &#163;1.4 billion a year to our economy, and SNH has said that the recent deaths</p><p>&#8220;detract from that value and diminish Scotland&#8217;s appeal as a major wildlife tourism destination.&#8221;</p><p>It is vulnerable raptors that are being targeted. Therefore, although overall numbers might be small, the impact on the populations can be significant.</p><p>I appreciate that such crime is difficult to tackle because of the remote locations, the length of time that it can take for a crime to be detected and the lack of witnesses. We have recently passed legislation and the Government has announced some welcome additional measures, but the lack of prosecution in recent cases&#8212;the poisoning of a golden eagle in December 2013, the poisoning of a peregrine falcon in February 2014 and the killing of a peregrine falcon in April 2014&#8212;shows that the crime is evading the law. If we can identify areas of legislation that can be strengthened or reviewed, we must give serious consideration to pursuing that option. We must also look critically at the resources that are being deployed, and we must challenge the culture in which such crimes are considered acceptable.</p><p>I am confident that everyone in the chamber today believes that the abhorrent deaths of the 22 raptors last month are unacceptable and that the perpetrators should be found and prosecuted. However, again and again we come back to the difficulty of detection and evidence gathering, and I believe that more can be done in those areas.</p><p>I am pleased that the Government is now consulting on greater powers for Scottish SPCA officers. The consultation was due last year, and in the light of delays I would be interested in hearing the reasons why we are having such a long consultation process, which will run from March to September. The minister will speak about that in his closing speech; perhaps he can tell us when any extra powers will be granted to the Scottish SPCA.</p><p>A proposal to increase penalties is very welcome. They must be fixed at a level that will provide a strong deterrent. However, deterrents will work only if there is a realistic prospect of prosecution. That is why the Scottish SPCA consultation is so important. RSPB Scotland&#8217;s briefing states that</p><p>&#8220;the expertise, specialist equipment and facilities of the SSPCA benefit the work of the police.&#8221;</p><p>We must ensure that the powers that are granted to inspectors are sufficient to contribute to the securing of convictions.</p><p>I have previously raised concerns over the role of wildlife crime officers in Police Scotland. Having spoken to people who work in that area, I know that there are concerns that it is often a part-time role or that officers are frequently moved around and changed. There is also an issue around commitment and expertise. The effectiveness of the role depends on the commitment and knowledge of the officer. There is a need for officers to gain the trust of the community, to know the community well, to be able to gather intelligence and to work in partnership with others. What discussions has the minister had with Police Scotland over operational matters on wildlife crime? Christine Grahame raised that issue.</p><p>Our amendment acknowledges the work that the Government is undertaking in relation to the Scottish SPCA and wildlife crime penalties, but it also calls for further action. I know that the Government recognises that need, and that it has given a commitment that, if such action needs to be taken, it will take it.</p><p>I appreciate that is not long since the passing of the WANE act, but there was a rise in confirmed raptor poisonings last year. There is a danger that this year&#8217;s incidents, combined with a lack of convictions, could encourage others to think that it is acceptable to carry out such crimes and that they are likely to get away with them. That suggests that there is a need for us to go back to the legislation, to scrutinise its measures and to consider additional action.</p><p>There is a belief that the detected crimes are perhaps not the complete picture. There will be undetected and unreported crime, so the true figures could be more significant. When the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill was passed, there was an indication that the Government would be prepared to go back and consider other options if the legislation was not successful. Although the introduction of vicarious liability was welcomed&#8212;there is a belief that it led initially to a reduction in poisonings&#8212;it has not yet been tested in a Scottish court, notwithstanding the current case at Stranraer. The lack of convictions for wildlife crimes seems to indicate that the 2011 act is failing to work as a vehicle for holding those responsible to account.</p><p>That is why, in our amendment, we propose that the Government should conduct a study of wildlife legislation from outwith Scotland, particularly of licensing and game-bird legislation in other countries. I am pleased that the minister has indicated that he will support our amendment.</p><p>The RSPB briefing highlights the fact that Scotland lacks any regulation of game shooting. My colleague Peter Peacock lodged amendments to the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill on that area at stage 3.</p><p>We cannot eradicate this type of crime without changing the culture. It seems to come from a place where there is a single focus on what one sector believes suits its needs, regardless of the consequences on other interests. That places a huge responsibility on land managers. I fully accept that a small minority is involved in any kind of criminal activity, and I fully acknowledge the contribution that NFU Scotland and Scottish Land &amp; Estates have made to the reward fund that was established by RSPB Scotland. However, there are still elements of land management that think that such activity is acceptable, perhaps even necessary, and we must all work together to challenge and change that culture. That challenge must come not just from politicians and conservationists, but from land managers themselves. As I say, it is a small minority but, when such acts are perpetrated, the subsequent negative press and public reaction impact on all landowners and land users across Scotland, on their businesses and on tourism as a whole.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Wildlife Crime (Raptors)"}, {"date": "2014-05-06", "body": "<p>That is an on-going police investigation. The minister said that we need to consider the science and where the bird population has been affected. We need to be honest: there are people involved in land management who think that such practices are acceptable. I fully accept that it is a minority, but we need to change that culture and make it clear that the practice is unacceptable.</p><p>I spoke to representatives of Scottish Land &amp; Estates last week. I recognise the work that it is doing to address the matter. Some people are perhaps not involved in any of the structures or big organisations, and we need to reach those people. As well as having robust legislation and an effective wildlife crime unit, we need to resource education and training opportunities properly. As I said, not every landowner or manager is a member of a formal organisation, and we need to ensure that they still have the opportunity to interrogate their practice and ensure that they are compliant with the law.</p><p>I looked back at the passage of the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill. Peter Peacock closed his speech by saying:</p><p>&#8220;The issue has not gone away; it will come back.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 2 March 2011; c 33708-09.]</p><p>We should all be hugely disappointed that those words have come to pass. We must continue to strive to create a culture where raptor persecution is unacceptable and where the practice will not be tolerated by anyone who has an interest in our countryside and wildlife. We must be prepared to take measures to ensure that that happens.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-09916.3, to leave out from first &#8220;welcomes&#8221; to &#8220;Police Scotland&#8221; and insert:</p><p>&#8220;believes that the commitment to tackle wildlife crime is shared across the Parliament; acknowledges the work undertaken by the Scottish Government and its relevant bodies and partners in working to tackle wildlife crime, including the review of wildlife crime penalties and the consultation for increased powers for the Scottish SPCA; however believes that the latest wildlife crimes show the urgent need for further action in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Government to conduct a study of licensing and game bird legislation in other countries with a view to working with other parties to review wildlife crime legislation in Scotland;&#8221;.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Wildlife Crime (Raptors)"}, {"date": "2014-05-06", "body": "<p>I start by thanking Kenny Gibson for securing the debate. I thank Dogs Trust for all its work campaigning for compulsory microchipping in Scotland and across the UK.</p><p>I apologise to the Parliament for having to leave the debate early this evening. I am disappointed not to be able to listen to other members&#8217; speeches; I will study the minister&#8217;s reply in the Official Report tomorrow.</p><p>In September 2013, I held a members&#8217; business debate on microchipping. Kenny Gibson spoke then of his visit to the rehoming centre in his constituency. I have not visited that Dogs Trust centre, but I have spent time at the centre in West Calder, where I discussed microchipping and I saw how easy it is to scan a dog. For the dog owner, microchipping is quick and cheap, and it is potentially even free. The scheme provides multiple benefits, as was highlighted by Mr Gibson in his opening speech. It should result in a reduction in the number of dogs that are abandoned or negligently allowed to stray, as well as enabling quick reunion with the owner.</p><p>Although the number of stray dogs in Scotland is reducing, which is to be welcomed, it is still at a significant level. The figures for the last year available, 2012-13, show that Scottish local authorities dealt with 3,525 stray dogs. That involves distress for the dogs and their owners, but also adds a considerable expense to the budgets of local authorities, which have to not only provide a dog warden service, but meet the kennelling costs for up to a week.</p><p>Microchipping has the advantage of being an immensely popular proposal with the public. A YouGov poll showed that 82 per cent of adults in Scotland would support its introduction. The measure has already been successfully introduced in Northern Ireland and is due to be introduced in Wales and England in the near future.</p><p>When I held my members&#8217; business debate in September 2013, the Scottish Government had yet to confirm its support for the measure: in his closing speech, the Minister for Environment and Climate Change indicated that the Government still had &#8220;some concerns&#8221; over its introduction. I am therefore delighted that the Government has overcome those concerns and is now minded towards introduction. That is to the credit of campaigners from across the country, led by charities such as Dogs Trust. I am sure that, like me, members across the Parliament have received emails from their constituents expressing support for the introduction of compulsory microchipping. The Government&#8217;s journey towards that introduction will have been aided by the campaign. There is evidence that it will be a very positive policy.</p><p>Compulsory microchipping is not, however, a measure to tackle dangerous dogs. It is perhaps another tool in the box&#8212;it can trace a dog back to its owner and it can help to encourage responsible dog ownership by bringing the owner into contact with services&#8212;but it does not itself change the behaviour of dogs or their owners.</p><p>The dangerous dogs consultation is disappointing, in that it concerns what I believe is a dog welfare policy, alongside another policy that it would appear no one, including the Government, supports, namely the compulsory muzzling of all dogs. There are legitimate concerns that the introduction of muzzling could have a detrimental impact on the welfare of dogs, as well as reinforcing a negative stereotype of all dogs as dangerous, which is far from the case. Muzzling already plays a part in tackling the issue of dangerous dogs, as long as it is used proportionately. Under the Control of Dogs (Scotland) Act 2010, muzzling can be included in a dog control notice. I believe that that has the support of animal welfare charities and should be maintained.</p><p>We must acknowledge the reason for the consultation, which is the incidence of dog attacks with tragic consequences. How do we address the problem when the owner is beyond changing their behaviour? I accept arguments around breed and deed, and evidence that shows that many incidents happen in the home, but what more can be done to protect communities, and children in particular, from aggressive dogs with irresponsible owners? Unfortunately, the consultation is limited in that area and, although I welcome microchipping, it is not the answer. We should be open to considering other models of dog control.</p><p>Of course, education and training for owners, as well as pets, is key. Kenneth Gibson highlighted the work that Dogs Trust is doing with young offenders. However, let us not kid ourselves that all owners will respond to such training. We must be open to considering measures that could give greater protection to communities from dangerous and out-of-control dogs.</p><p>I welcome the measure on compulsory microchipping and look forward to its introduction in Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Responsible Dog Ownership"}, {"date": "2014-04-29", "body": "<p>Some of those issues were raised in the debate last week. Can Dave Thompson explain to me how the seven votes of an independent Scotland, which would be equivalent to the votes that Estonia has, would give more influence to Scottish fishing than the 29 votes that the UK has?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Inshore Fisheries"}, {"date": "2014-04-29", "body": "<p>I am pleased to close the debate for Labour. Scotland is a coastal nation. We have more than 6,000 miles of coastline, and the majority of MSPs represent coastal areas. I remember learning at school that Fife is a peninsula in the shape of a terrier&#8217;s head that traces a coastline that is rich in history.</p><p>With more than 100 miles of coastline, Fife&#8217;s history as a leisure, industrial, maritime, trading and fishing region has been shaped by its coastline. King James IV of Scotland described Fife as a</p><p>&#8220;a beggar&#8217;s mantle fringed wi gould&#8221;.</p><p>The gold fringe is the coast and its chain of little ports with their thriving fishing fleets and rich trading links.</p><p>With industrialisation, the focus of Fife&#8217;s economy turned increasingly away from the coast and towards coal mining. However, the coast is again a vital part of the economy, and the expansion of leisure opportunities, offshore renewables and the developments at Rosyth port are all examples of how we see competing interests and opportunities along our coastline.</p><p>The motion talks about the cultural contribution. Fife is lucky to have the Scottish Fisheries Museum in Anstruther, and Roderick Campbell gave a fair analysis of the challenges that the inshore sector of the east neuk faces. Other more remote communities have inshore fisheries that play a much bigger part in their economies. Much of Scotland&#8217;s inshore fleet of smaller boats exclusively employs local residents, which should build in a great incentive not to overexploit the resource. The income that they generate is retained locally to the benefit of many fragile rural communities. Those fisheries, particularly the creeling and diving fisheries, can be entirely compatible with other income streams including marine tourism, which brings positive diversity to the area&#8217;s economic opportunities.</p><p>Inshore fishing&#8217;s importance to our coastal communities, particularly in the context of employment, is evident. I was pleased to hear members talk about successes in Eyemouth and Arbroath. Some of Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable towns and villages are on the coast; we must work together to deliver a strong and sustainable future for them. Inshore fishing and its benefits are vital for many areas. Members talked about the importance of the onshore sector&#8212;the processing sector&#8212;and the employment that it provides in many communities.</p><p>The inshore sector brings in upwards of &#163;80&#160;million to the Scottish economy&#8212;much of it in exports. How can we ensure that our coastal communities see more benefits from the revenue that has been generated on their doorstep?</p><p>Inshore fishing can be a volatile industry. Jayne Baxter talked about the challenges that face the industry in our region, in particular around the east neuk, and noted the fluctuation in the value of landings. The overall quayside value of sea fish and shellfish decreased by 8 per cent in 2013. Bertie Armstrong has talked about the difficulties that that has presented for the fishing sector. The Scottish Government has announced a hardship fund and a fund that aims to support the creel industry, which I very much welcome.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary said, we need to consider how we provide a legacy for the sector and opportunities for young skippers who come into the sector. We should ensure that the industry can be sustainable, by implementing a strategy that looks to the industry&#8217;s longer-term future, in not just financial but environmental terms. Elaine Murray&#8217;s description of cockle fishing in the Solway Firth showed how challenging that can be. She talked about the difficulty of enforcement, which Scottish Environment LINK mentioned in its briefing for this debate. How can licensing and service restrictions be enforced?</p><p>We need a long-term vision and plan. Our inshore marine environment is complex and remains poorly understood. The notes from the 2013 conference demonstrate that data collection is a big issue. How can we ensure that we have robust data and scientific evidence on which to base our decisions?</p><p>In the short term, what we must deliver is clear; we need a marine plan and an ecologically coherent network of well-managed marine protected areas by 2016. We then need responsive, collaborative management, which balances the needs of different sectors. Progress in that regard will help to address tensions. I remember the members&#8217; business debate on the proposed special area of conservation designation for the Sound of Barra, which took place when the minister was fairly new in his post. In that case, the community was fearful of the risk to their fishing opportunities that the designation might present.</p><p>There is also increasing interest from the offshore sector in using our harbours. We need to ensure that we have a robust management system that facilitates constructive work with all interests.</p><p>Rhoda Grant talked about the need for strengthened local management in the interests of conservation. We should ensure that inshore fisheries groups that represent the fishing communities are empowered and given the tools that they need if they are to manage and conserve fishing for the good of their local economies.</p><p>Scotland takes the lead on many environmental issues. We fish in challenging mixed fisheries, and we have taken measures to improve the health of our seas and to deliver a more sustainable fishery. It can be argued that we have taken the lead in Europe on such issues.</p><p>However, Scottish Environment LINK expressed concern about unsustainable practices in inshore fishing, such as non-target bycatch, sea-bed habitat damage and overfishing. LINK acknowledged the measures that fishermen have taken to start to address such issues, but expressed concern about the IFGs&#8217; high-level management plans, which it says</p><p>&#8220;focus largely on conserving the stock levels of target species&#8221;,</p><p>rather than on meeting a more high-level environmental objective. LINK says that the plans</p><p>&#8220;therefore fail to address wider ecosystem concerns.&#8221;</p><p>We must strike the right balance between profitability and sustainability. Long-term profits might look inviting to many fishermen, some of whom struggle from season to season, and to coastal communities, but long-term sustainability and, especially, healthy fishing stocks can provide for sustained revenues that would ensure that in the future communities not just survive but thrive.</p><p>Scotland has an excellent international reputation for our seafood, which is exported all over the world. Last week, I visited Macrae Edinburgh Ltd in Livingston, which produces fish and seafood exclusively for the domestic market, with a focus on smoked salmon. In Scotland, we produce high-quality sustainable and traceable produce with a focus on consumer confidence. However, in that meeting, I was struck by the focus on occasion or party food; seafood and shellfish are not an everyday meal for us, which is very different from how people eat on the continent. We need to do all that we can to promote seafood.</p><p>Last year, I took part in Sainsbury&#8217;s switch the fish campaign, which encouraged people to eat Scottish mussels rather than prawns, and I follow @fishisthedish Twitter recipes, which encourage consumption and try to change consumer behaviour. We need more marketing initiatives. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s confirmation of the increased support for Seafood Scotland.</p><p>So, opportunity exists; we can see the demand from around the world for Scottish produce. It is only right that we take advantage of that, but we need to ensure that we sustain a domestic market. We are increasingly seeing imported tropical prawns and Canadian lobsters. We have quality produce here, and we need to do more to promote locally sourced seafood. Rob Gibson made good points on that subject.</p><p>I could see no report yet from this year&#8217;s seafood conference, but from last year&#8217;s report it appears that there was a big debate about certification. Certification was recognised as an indication of good management and sustainability, but it was not considered to have shown increased financial returns for fishermen and was viewed as being costly and overonerous. Can the cabinet secretary give an update on discussions with the Marine Stewardship Council on that issue ?</p><p>In its briefing for the debate, SIFT raised important concerns about the contrast between Scotland and England. In October, it said:</p><p>&#8220;There is little doubt that the management and compliance monitoring of Scotland&#8217;s inshore waters is being starved of resources and falls far behind the situation in England. In essence Scotland is trying to manage inshore fisheries that cover almost twice the length of England&#8217;s coast with less than 25% of the budget.&#8221;</p><p>England, of course, does not have the same deep-sea fishing sector that Scotland has, and its focus may lie elsewhere. We can also perhaps see that it has a different emphasis in the UK fisheries minister&#8217;s decision to redistribute some fishing quota away from the major operators in favour of the smaller-scale fishermen. SIFT described that move as signifying</p><p>&#8220;a shift towards recognising the importance of the small boat inshore fleet&#8221;</p><p>and confirming</p><p>&#8220;that the fishery is a public resource that should be managed for the benefit of the many, rather than&#8221;</p><p>the few.</p><p>There is a legitimate call to have that principle demonstrated more clearly in Scotland in the management of inshore waters. We need to be clearer about how we will demonstrate that.</p><p>I support Alison Johnstone&#8217;s comments about the strategy; I, too, had difficulty in finding a strategy beyond the press release, which gave high-level objectives. There needs to be more detail for Parliament.</p><p>The debate has been interesting, and I hope that the cabinet secretary will respond to the comments that have been made by many members.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Inshore Fisheries"}, {"date": "2014-04-24", "body": "<p></p><p>6.

However, in light of major developments in the area, such as the energy park at Methil and the expansion of Diageo in Leven, does she recognise that there is now a strong case for reviewing the rail link among the Government&#8217;s transport priorities, given that an infrastructure project of that size will not be able to go forward without financial backing from the Scottish Government.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Levenmouth Rail Link"}, {"date": "2014-04-22", "body": "<p>I am pleased to speak in the debate.

We owe it to everyone who has a vote in September&#8212;including those in leading industries and sectors&#8212;to be honest, open and transparent.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s role in Europe has not been diminished due to being part of the UK. We have been able to work in partnership and there have been many positive and important outcomes. Currently, as part of the UK, we have 29 votes&#8212;a voting bloc that no other country can better. On balance, it is more positive for our sectors to keep that strong voice at the top table.

The issue is that the Scottish Government can give no guarantees to Scottish farmers about what the situation will be once we have had to renegotiate our way into the EU. It is unfair of the Government to make big promises of increased payments that it cannot justify.</p><p>The benefits of remaining within the UK, with its voting power, are clear. Even if an independent Scotland were to join with Ireland, Croatia and Lithuania, it still would not have the voting bloc or the strength of voice that it currently has.</p><p>That strength allows us opportunities within the EU. For example, recently, we were able to play a much stronger hand in the dispute about mackerel, in which UK representation and influence backed up the argument. Also as part of the UK, we were able to deliver a conservation credit scheme, which was of great benefit to Scottish fishermen when it came to the debate on days at sea.</p><p>Our quotas need to remain at a level that will ensure the future of our fishermen. By being part of the UK, we are able to benefit from flexibility that might not be available post independence. Currently, quotas are negotiated as part of the UK and then divided among the home nations. The recent concordat provides stability in that situation. Our sector in Scotland benefits from having a bigger UK quota and a relative stability that can be vital in a sector in which the catches and values can fluctuate, as was highlighted only last week by the news that the value of Scottish landings had dropped by 8 per cent.</p><p>As part of the UK, we also have the opportunity to lease quota among our partners throughout the UK. That is a unique arrangement. The other option that is available to member states is to trade quota, but that obviously means giving up some quota. Under the leasing arrangement, Scotland is able to catch more quota from throughout the UK and more than its original allocation. That leasing arrangement is a valuable commodity for our sector, as it gives it access to higher quota, but it would disappear under independence. The opportunity to lease among partners would be turned into having to trade with competitors.</p><p>At the heart of the matter is the fact that we do not know what the outcome of negotiations for EU membership will be. At least we now have an acceptance that there will be negotiations, but we are asking businesses and sectors to take a leap in the dark. We know that the membership process will be protracted, difficult and political. It is not realistic to suggest otherwise.</p><p>The SNP asserts that the negotiations will be finalised by March 2016, but that seems pretty unrealistic to someone who has followed the recent CAP negotiations. Negotiations in Europe are never that simple. What will happen to sectors that are dependent on the EU if the negotiation is longer than the promised 18 months? What will happen to the quotas and the continuing CAP negotiations?</p><p>The new member states may all agree that an independent Scotland could join&#8212;I say &#8220;may&#8221;, as many of the national states have their own separatist movements on which they have an eye&#8212;but there are no guarantees about what the conditions would be. Nations that want more money for farmers or more quotas for their fishermen will regard it as an opportunity to better their lot at Scotland&#8217;s expense. The rebate, which is worth &#163;135 to every Scottish household, will be up for grabs.</p><p>Scotland cannot go into negotiations without recognising the need to compromise. To think otherwise is politically naive and potentially damaging to some of our biggest sectors. Will we compromise on the rebate, our fishermen or our farmers? When Nicola Sturgeon went to the European Council, she argued about retaining the rebate; she did not argue for more support for fishing or farming.</p><p>SNP members will no doubt highlight, as the cabinet secretary did, the UK Government&#8217;s recent decision on the convergence uplift. I do not defend that decision; it was wrong and there was cross-party support for questioning it. However, although we agree on the problem, we do not agree on the solution. I think that a solution can be found within the UK that will deliver a level playing field for our farmers.

Only 51 per cent of the 14.9 million population has access to good sanitation, 47 per cent of children under five are stunted, one in 36 pregnant women dies from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, and HIV/AIDS, which is prevalent throughout Africa, affects 10.8 per cent of the population. Despite those dire health statistics, the country has one of the lowest number of doctors per capita&#8212;one per 50,000.</p><p>International epidemiological studies suggest that the rates of mental illness in Malawi are at least as high as those in western countries. Mental health provision is, to say the least, extremely sparse. The country has only one state psychiatrist, Dr Felix Kauye.</p><p>The Scotland Malawi Mental Health Education Project, which is a charity, is a good example of Scots working together with Malawians. The project delivers the teaching of a psychiatry module to medical students, supports postgraduate psychiatric trainees and delivers training to psychiatric nurses and clinical officers based in Zomba mental hospital and the Queen Elizabeth central hospital in Blantyre. It helps to organise the annual mental health conference, which is attended by delegates from most of sub-Saharan Africa, the UK, Europe and the USA.</p><p>It is a good example of a project that receives multiple support from the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland, the Scottish Government, NHS Education for Scotland, the Tropical Health and Education Trust and local postgraduate deaneries and tutors.</p><p>The other big topic is tackling infectious diseases, particularly pneumonia and diarrhoea, and over the past decade Malawi has made significant progress in reducing deaths in children under five. However, pneumonia is still the single biggest killer, taking the lives of 1,000 babies and young children in 2010. Diarrhoea is another major threat, causing the deaths of 600 children a year. No single intervention is effective in the treatment or control of either condition. However, the good news is that Malawi is beginning to reduce infections and deaths from those two previously stubborn killers by using multiple actions; vaccines against pneumococcal bacteria and rotavirus are two of the newest tools, which are now part of its regular routine childhood vaccination schedule.</p><p>As Patricia Ferguson said, it is important that the Government here works in partnership with the Department for International Development, whose expenditure in Malawi is &#163;117.5 million, on its education, health, agriculture, water and sanitation programmes.

It supports bursaries for the secondary school and the provision of clean water and sanitation, and it works in partnership with Mary&#8217;s Meals to provide meals for primary school pupils in a kitchen that Dunblane donated. The Rotary Club of Bridge of Allan and Dunblane, working with the Gloag Foundation, supports the elimination of fistula through the Freedom from Fistula Foundation.</p><p>It is through such multilevel connections and support, which involve the UK Government, the Scottish Government and various organisations and communities in Scotland, that we can continue to foster the growing number of partnerships with Malawi.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland and Malawi"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>If I may, I will very gently point out to the cabinet secretary a small correction: north-east England has more GPs per head than Scotland, as he will see from the four countries report.</p><p>The whistleblowers telephone line was eventually introduced by the Scottish Government two years after the English line came into being.

It is based on a collaborative and co-operative approach that has been agreed by all five parties. We have the highly respected Scottish Medicines Consortium and our evidence-based Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network guidelines. We have higher numbers of consultants, higher numbers of nurses and higher numbers of beds. All that is underpinned by the fact that we receive more funds through the Barnett formula, as does the north-east of England, on the basis of need. When it was introduced, the Barnett formula was not based on need; it was expected to take us to even-stevens over the years.

What does Dave Thompson not understand about the concept of redistribution?</p><p>The biggest challenge to Scotland&#8217;s current pre-eminence in health that would arise from independence would come about indirectly. We have five medical schools, which is far more than we require. Students from England pay substantial tuition fees for medicine and, indeed, for all other forms of higher education. That adds to the bill that Iain Gray added up. There are a few more figures that need to be added to that bill. If we become independent, we will lose &#163;140&#160;million in university fees, because we will not be able to charge students from other European Union countries those fees. Over time, the Howat report&#8217;s prediction that we should halve our medical student intake would come to pass, which would mean our having two fewer medical schools. We have been able to have five medical schools because we are part of the union.</p><p>Within the UK, Scotland punches massively above its weight in medical research. We win about 14 per cent of competitive research applications&#8212;I stress the word &#8220;competitive&#8221;&#8212;which results in our getting &#163;257&#160;million from the UK Medical Research Council.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>I am sorry, but I must make some progress.</p><p>A population-based share of that funding would be only 8.3 per cent. Even the Scottish National Party must accept that that is a fact. The &#163;83&#160;million that the University of Edinburgh raised from UK research councils equalled a third of its overall research income. The University of Dundee received &#163;21&#160;million from the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council out of &#163;121&#160;million in research funding. If we did not receive funding from the UK research councils, we would have to make up that difference. That must be added to the bill for the fantasy land that we are being presented with.</p><p>The same applies to the funding that we receive from the other 13 research councils. We also punch well above our weight in securing funding from them&#8212;we get about 13 per cent of the funding that they offer. Under independence, we might be able to afford to provide that funding, but we would not be winning research applications in competition with institutions from the rest of the UK, which would mean that, over time, the quality of our research would be likely to degrade. I have no doubt that Scotland would eventually gain entry to the EU, but any delay in EU membership could interrupt the horizon 2020 funding as well. Therefore, for research, there would only be a downside to independence.</p><p>Of course, the nationalists will promise to match that research funding, but we do not know how they would do that. The same issue would affect the funding that we receive from the Wellcome Trust and other charities that would not, following independence, fund in the same way. If members do not believe that, they should look at what happened to Eire. When Eire became independent, it lost the funding that it had received from the MRC, and the Wellcome Trust provides funding only of up to 50 per cent for projects in Eire, rather than for 100 per cent of them, as is the case in Scotland.</p><p>There are many other downsides. For example, we might well have to set up a whole raft of agencies and, for me, the biggest disappointment is that we have absolutely no costings for that. Would we have to set up a separate human tissue or organ donation organisation? Would we need a separate health professional council, a separate general medical council, a separate general dental council or a separate nursing and midwifery council? We are going to have to set up 277 agencies, and we have had no idea from the SNP or the yes campaign about what the costs are going to be.

As others have said, she has made this a core issue throughout all parliamentary sessions, including by introducing a member&#8217;s bill that changed some of the public&#8217;s perception, but more needs to be done.</p><p>The 2011 publication &#8220;Improving Maternal and Infant Nutrition: A Framework for Action&#8221; was a useful document, and it should now be seen in the context of the early years collaborative, as it develops, and the family nurse partnership, among other initiatives. The report&#8217;s adoption of the World Health Organization&#8217;s view that breastfeeding should be exclusive in the first six months was also welcome. The report also recognises that breastfeeding is crucial for the development of the infant and for the good future health of the mother, including a return to pre-pregnancy weight, which is becoming increasingly important as obesity becomes ever more prevalent in Scotland.</p><p>Infants who get the immunological benefits of breast milk that cannot be supplied by formula have reduced risk of ear, respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections; of allergic disease, including eczema, asthma and wheezing; and of type 1 diabetes. They are also less likely to be overweight, which again contributes to the major public health issue of obesity. Furthermore, infants who are breastfed are less at risk of childhood leukaemia and sudden unexplained infant death, and there might also be an association with improved cognitive development. Pre-term babies who are breastfed are likely to have better eyesight and brain development than those who are not and have a reduced risk of necrotising enterocolitis.</p><p>The factors that are associated with influencing breastfeeding are many and varied, particularly for pre-term babies where there can be considerable difficulty, and they might have to be tube-fed, as happened to one of my grandsons. It is particularly important that those mothers get the help that they need.</p><p>The quality of assistance during delivery and in the first few days is important, and yet we have a situation in which&#8212;instead of what happened when I was a student, when there were 14 days lying-in, as it was called&#8212;many mothers now go home within a few hours of delivery. Have we really adjusted the services to accommodate that? I believe that that is a factor in the poor rates of breastfeeding that we see.</p><p>Once mothers get out of hospital, getting professional and peer-to-peer support is important. Is there now comprehensive mapping of the accessibility of breastfeeding peer support groups?</p><p>The Government has to take some responsibility for our problems in that it cut the midwifery student intake by 40 per cent some three years ago. To be frank, that was a foolish decision. It was wrong for Scotland and certainly wrong for the UK, where there were and still are serious shortages of midwives. Worse still, it resulted in the precipitate closure of three university schools of midwifery. The subsequent partial reversal, with increases, came too late to reopen those schools.</p><p>At the same time, we have really serious problems with health visitor recruitment and training. That is still being left to health boards, which, again, is not the correct decision. The Government needs to take a far stronger hold of the training of health visitors, who can be critical to the sustaining of breastfeeding, not just its establishment.</p><p>The University of Dundee is involved in a programme of research. It has done very good work on incentives to stop smoking, and it is now doing a project, in association with an English unit, on the potential of financial voucher incentives for breastfeeding. It will be interesting to see what emerges from that research and whether the approach should be adopted.</p><p>One important issue that other speakers have not mentioned is the fact that Scotland has only one breast milk bank&#8212;there are 17 in the United Kingdom&#8212;and I wonder whether there are plans to extend that with a second.

According to an Ipsos MORI poll that was carried out last year, 50 per cent of people in Scotland believed that the welfare system was too generous as against only 25 per cent who thought that it was not generous enough. A similar poll showed that 73 per cent of people in Scotland supported a general benefits cap as against only 12 per cent who opposed it. There is actually more support in Scotland for a benefits cap than in the UK as a whole.</p><p>Liam McArthur reminded us that everyone agrees with welfare reform&#8212;or so they say. Everyone agrees that the previous system simply did not help people when they needed help and that its costs rose too quickly. However, although those in other parties claim to support welfare reform, in practice, they oppose every measure proposed by the UK Government to try to deal with it. If they believe in welfare reform, they need to tell us precisely what measures they would implement to reduce the growth in the welfare budget.</p><p>I turn to some of the points raised in the debate.</p><p>Alex Johnstone reminded us that we regularly hear from the SNP that welfare reform is taking &#163;6 billion out of the economy. That claim would have some credibility if the SNP was proposing to reverse on independence those so-called cuts, so let us look precisely at what the SNP proposes in its white paper.</p><p>We know that by far the two biggest components in that &#163;6 billion are the change in the uprating of benefits inflation linking from the retail prices index to the consumer prices index and the removal of child benefit from higher earners. Between them, those two changes make up the vast bulk of those savings. However, I could see nothing in the white paper about reversing those changes. The white paper says that benefits will rise with inflation, but does that refer to the CPI or the RPI? We can only assume that it is the CPI. If I am wrong, no doubt I will stand corrected in the minister&#8217;s closing speech.</p><p>The only detailed proposals on welfare in the white paper are to remove the spare room subsidy, which has already been mitigated by the actions of this devolved Parliament, and stop the roll-out of universal credit and personal independence payments. The best that can be said about those changes is that the costs are marginal in the context of the total savings from welfare reform.</p><p>Therefore, the proposition that the SNP puts forward in the debate that voting for independence will make a huge difference when it comes to welfare and, in the words of the Government motion,</p><p>&#8220;only with the full powers of independence can the UK Government welfare cuts be halted&#8221;</p><p>is shown to be utterly worthless because the bulk of the reductions will not be reversed under the SNP&#8217;s proposals.</p><p>What would the welfare system in an independent Scotland be? We do not know. How much would it cost? We do not know. Would taxes have to rise to pay for higher benefits? We do not know and, as Jackie Baillie reminded us, we do not even know what currency those benefits would be paid in. The SNP is using welfare policy to try to argue the case for independence but, without any detail on its alternatives, the claims that it makes are simply dishonest.</p><p>I understand that yesterday at the Welfare Reform Committee, Nicola Sturgeon said that she foresaw no net increase in welfare costs in an independent Scotland beyond proposals that have already been announced.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>I am sorry. From a sedentary position, the cabinet secretary has corrected me. She says that that is what the welfare review group recommended.

There is no magic money tree. There will not be more money to spend on benefits if we become independent. In fact, there will be less.</p><p>The SNP is trying cynically to play on the fears of those who are in poverty and of the disabled by promising that independence will mean that they have more money and greater security, but it cannot produce any concrete promises to back up those proposals. It is a deeply cynical and disgraceful tactic of which SNP members should be ashamed.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I will begin by paraphrasing Winston Churchill. He said that it is always a challenge on such occasions to have to follow a really great speaker. Fortunately today I have only to follow Chic Brodie.</p><p>Like many other members in the debate, Mr Brodie spoke about the issue of currency. That issue is important, because currency is at the heart of how we take our economy forward.</p><p>Nothing typifies the weakness of the SNP&#8217;s case better than its stance on currency. We know that the SNP stance is that there should be a currency union with the rest of the UK post independence, but that stance is not shared by many other people who are involved in the yes campaign, such as Patrick Harvie, Jim Sillars, Colin Fox and even the campaign&#8217;s chair Dennis Canavan.</p><p>Mr Swinney and his colleagues continually assert that there will of course be a currency union between Scotland and the rest of the UK after a yes vote because that is manifestly in the rest of the UK&#8217;s interests. However, that view is not taken by the leadership of the three major Westminster parties or by the people of the rest of the UK, who in successive opinion polls have said that they do not want to share their currency with an independent Scotland.</p><p>Nor is it the view of a whole range of experts. When the Parliament&#8217;s Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee took evidence on the issue in the spring, we heard from experts including Sir John Gieve, former deputy governor of the Bank of England; Professor Ronald MacDonald of the University of Glasgow; Dr Monique Ebell of NIESR; Professor David Bell of the University of Stirling; and the currency expert Dr Angus Armstrong. They were all quite clear in their view that a currency union as proposed by the SNP would not be in the interests of the rest of the UK.</p><p>I know that the committee also heard from Professor Anton Muscatelli of the University of Glasgow, who, in fairness, takes a different view. However, he was very much a lone voice among those who gave evidence. The weight of expert opinion is contrary to what the SNP claims, and yet its members still assert those claims as fact.</p><p>That leaves us with the question of plan B. The First Minister seems to be hinting that the preferred alternative to currency union is sterlingisation: using sterling without a formal currency union. However, as an expert report pointed out last week, that would be disastrous for the financial services sector in Scotland and would leave us without a lender of last resort.</p><p>There are 115,000 people directly employed in the financial services sector in Scotland at present. How many of those jobs would be retained if we went down that route?</p><p>The First Minister says:</p><p>&#8220;It is our pound, and we are keeping it.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 7 August 2014; c 33160.]</p><p>We have also heard him say that the pound is an asset of the UK that we are entitled to retain and that, if Scotland is denied a share, we do not need to take on any of the liabilities.</p><p>That demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding. A currency is not an asset but a means of exchange issued by an institution&#8212;in this case, by the Bank of England. If the people in Scotland vote to leave the United Kingdom, they vote to leave its institutions behind. We might be entitled to a share of their asset value, but the claim that we retain a right to the Bank of England after a yes vote is as absurd as saying that we retain a right to other institutions such as the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the Ministry of Defence.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>That is a bizarre intervention from Mr Brodie. The negotiations will take place between two sovereign Governments, which will of course be answerable to their electorates.</p><p>As I have already said, the latest poll says that 60 per cent of the population of the rest of the UK do not want to countenance a currency union with an independent Scotland.</p><p>What would Scotland walking away from a share of the UK debt actually mean? Writing in this weekend&#8217;s Scotland on Sunday, Bill Jamieson put it better than I ever could:</p><p>&#8220;It would be an act of national financial suicide, branding Scotland as an untrustworthy borrower and wreaking havoc with our claims to fiscal probity.&#8221;</p><p>Angus Armstrong addressed that point when he appeared before the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, and he made it clear that there were two substantial downsides to Scotland defaulting on a share of UK debt. First, there would be an impact on borrowing costs. International investors would regard an independent country that had just repudiated its debt share as a poor risk, and the consequence would be much higher borrowing costs in Scotland than at present, which would be a real financial burden on businesses and ordinary families across the land.</p><p>Secondly, in the words of Angus Armstrong,</p><p>&#8220;The precedent that that would set for the rest of Europe would be extraordinary&#8212;any part could unilaterally have a referendum on independence and have no debt. There are a lot of places in Europe that would like to do that. People have to think about the broader consequence of that.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, 5 March 2014; c 4071.]</p><p>Dr Armstrong was absolutely right to highlight that concern. Members must imagine the consequences for debt-laden countries such as Italy or Spain if a precedent was established that parts of them could vote to leave without taking any debt with them and then presumably think that they could waltz into EU membership without difficulty. Nothing would be more likely to provoke a veto on Scottish accession to the EU.</p><p>I am sure that those are the arguments that weighed heavily with the fiscal commission when its members failed to support the Scottish Government&#8217;s stance on the issue&#8212;although we await with interest Mr Beveridge&#8217;s answers to those questions when he makes his speech on Monday.</p><p>The fact is that the SNP stance on currency is a total shambles. Members do not just have to take my word for it&#8212;they should listen to what the SNP&#8217;s former deputy leader Jim Sillars has said. I have a lot of sympathy for the view that the logical position is that an independent country should have its own currency, perhaps with a currency board arrangement with the rest of the UK. However, that is not what is on offer. Instead, we are being offered something impractical, unworkable and increasingly incredible.</p><p>All this matters, because people need to know the currency in which their wages will be paid, in which they will pay their mortgages and in which businesses will make their loan repayments. We need to hear from the Scottish Government what its preferred alternative to currency union is. Until it tells us that, its economic plans are totally without credibility.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I congratulate Drew Smith on securing the debate, and I commend him for the balanced and fair tone of his motion and his opening speech.</p><p>Our overriding concern must be for the innocent civilians caught up in the strife. As we have heard, the civilian suffering, especially that of the children involved, is appalling and tragic. The Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, has rightly called the current situation in Gaza and Israel a humanitarian catastrophe.</p><p>Given the rapidly deteriorating situation, the United Kingdom Secretary of State for International Development has made around &#163;12 million available in emergency support, including healthcare, clean water, blankets and cooking equipment, to help the people who are affected by the violence in Gaza. The Department for International Development is also bringing forward &#163;3 million in funding to help the International Committee of the Red Cross respond to the worsening situation.</p><p>This is in the context of wider support from DFID, which in the past four years has provided a total of &#163;349 million to support Palestinian development, of which &#163;30 million a year goes directly to help the people of Gaza and to develop Palestinian institutions and the economy so that a future Palestinian state can be stable and prosperous, and it can live side by side in peace and security with Israel.</p><p>In looking at the conflict, we need to remember that the victims are not just in Gaza. There are victims in Gaza and Israel, and Gazan civilians are not the only casualties in the recent spate of rocket attacks. The Israelis are also living with the consequences of the on-going conflict and the Israel defence force estimates that 5 million Israel civilians live within the range of rockets fired from Gaza. The danger in playing the blame game is that it suggests that the fault is all on one side, and I do not believe that that is the case.</p><p>I agree that Israel&#8217;s response has been disproportionate, but let us not be in any doubt that Hamas is a terrorist organisation, one that is vilified by most of the Arab world. While the retaliatory action taken by Israel has had devastating effects on innocent civilians, we cannot ignore the fact that Hamas has been using its own people as human shields and sacrifices to justify firing rockets at Israeli civilians and to increase its own civilian casualties to turn western opinion against Israel. Indeed, it has broken two ceasefires to date. Hamas is putting Gazans in harm&#8217;s way by using UN schools and hospitals to store rockets and launch attacks.</p><p>All of us in the chamber want to see an end to the death of innocents, and we should put pressure on the Israeli Government because of its actions. However, we should not be naive enough to place all the blame at Israel&#8217;s door when Hamas&#8217;s aim is to destroy Israel and kill each and every Jew.

It is also true to say, as Patricia Ferguson pointed out, that Christianity has never been more persecuted at any time in its 2,000-year history. I think that those two facts are probably linked as cause and effect, because Christianity is never stronger than when it is persecuted. The Christian faith never grows faster than when it is subject to persecution.</p><p>Just last month, the Vatican suggested that, in the current year, across the world 100,000 Christians will die for their faith. That is a staggering statistic and one that we hear too little about in this country. I am particularly grateful that Dave Thompson has given the Parliament the opportunity to highlight that important issue.</p><p>About 31 per cent of the world&#8217;s population are Christians, and 80 per cent of all acts of religious discrimination are directed against Christians. Statistically, that makes Christianity the most persecuted religion in the world. Given that the Commonwealth games closed earlier this week, I highlight the fact that 10 of the top 50 countries in which Christians are most persecuted are Commonwealth countries: the Maldives, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brunei, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Kenya, Bangladesh and Tanzania.</p><p>John Mason and others mentioned the horrendous situation that exists in Iraq and Syria with the formation of the new Islamic State. Human Rights Watch has said that the IS</p><p>&#8220;seems intent on wiping out all traces of minority groups from areas it now controls in Iraq. No matter how hard its leaders and fighters try to justify these heinous acts as religious devotion, they amount to nothing less than a reign of terror.&#8221;</p><p>If anyone wants an indication of what that reign of terror feels like on the ground, I commend to them the regular dispatches from the chaplain of St George&#8217;s, Baghdad, Canon Andrew White. In the Church Times the other day, he was reported as saying:</p><p>&#8220;things are desperate; our people are disappearing ... Are we seeing the end of Christianity? We are committed, come what may. We will keep going to the end, but it looks as though the end could be very near.&#8221;</p><p>He added that Iraqi Christians were</p><p>&#8220;in grave danger. There are literally Christians living in the desert and on the street. They have nowhere to go.&#8221;</p><p>Even more chillingly, just the other day he reported that a family of eight had been found in their home. Lying in a pool of blood with an open Bible beside them, they had been shot through their faces because they would not renounce their Christian faith. Those are horrific pictures, which are almost reminiscent of what happened in Roman times.</p><p>What can be done? We have an opportunity to use the avenues that are open to us to actively promote human rights. We have the opportunity to use the moneys that the Scottish Government has for foreign aid. The UK has a substantial foreign aid budget&#8212;we are the second-largest donor of foreign aid&#8212;and we can use that to promote our message about spreading freedom and human rights around the world. The UK has already given &#163;5 million in humanitarian aid to Iraq and more can be done.</p><p>It is also a case of simply showing solidarity.

Like other members in the chamber, I had the privilege of visiting Malawi on a parliamentary visit some years ago. Just as the minister said in relation to his visits, I would say that those who visit Malawi and see the projects that have been supported by the Scottish Government&#8217;s spend cannot but come away impressed and deeply moved by the difference that they are making to people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>I want to touch on three aspects of the support for Malawi. The first is the Scottish Government&#8217;s programme. As the minister accepted, the programme started in 2005 and has been continued and developed by successive Scottish Governments. It is extremely welcome and, as I said, makes a huge difference on the ground.</p><p>The second is the civic engagement that Patricia Ferguson has just talked about and to which the minister referred as well. We are all aware of a range of charities, schools and church groups across Scotland, in all our constituencies and regions, which are helping in Malawi. Of course, the Government plays a key role here, but the support from broader Scotland goes way beyond what comes from Government. It is of huge value and I know that it makes a tremendous difference to the lives of millions of Malawians.</p><p>The third aspect, which my amendment touches on, is that we cannot talk about the support for Malawi without also making reference to the support that we in Scotland give through the United Kingdom and DFID, which in 2014-15 amounts to some &#163;90 million to Malawi, supporting education, healthcare and food assistance.</p><p>The UK is one of only five countries meeting the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income going to international development and humanitarian causes. That is very welcome and I noticed how the Scotland Malawi Partnership welcomed the fact that the Scottish Government is working hand in hand with the UK Government in delivering that target.</p><p>We know that we here in Scotland have a special relationship with Malawi. We only had to watch the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth games and see the rapturous welcome for the Malawian team when it entered Celtic Park to know that there is a special affection here in Scotland for Malawi.</p><p>The minister raised the important question of Scotland&#8217;s and the UK&#8217;s legacy in many of our former colonial parts of the country. Of course, there are dark periods there. It was interesting that at the time of the Commonwealth games a poll was published that showed that 49 per cent of people in the UK thought that the British empire left a generally positive legacy and 15 per cent disagreed. When I visited Malawi, I was struck by how positively our influence was viewed.</p><p>The minister also talked about David Livingstone, who was perhaps the Scottish figure who had the most influence and has the most resonance in Malawi&#8217;s history. David Livingstone did not go to Malawi to conquer, exploit or enslave the people; he went there to bring freedom. He went as a liberator. His self-confessed objective was to open up central Africa to Christianity and commerce. Commerce was so important to him because it was the way to defeat the slave trade. For much of his life, he was not actually engaged in missionary work; he spent much of his life in exploration and trying to open up trade routes east to west across Africa, so that central Africa could be available to trade with the rest of the world. He saw that as the way to build a local economy that would not be dependent upon the slave trade, so that it could be stamped out.</p><p>Anyone who goes to Malawi today will be struck by how the twin objectives of ending the slave trade and introducing Christianity made David Livingstone so important to Malawians today. Of course, Malawi is a very Christian country, as anyone who has been there can testify.</p><p>We can also play a role in helping to strengthen democracy. In my amendment, I mention good governance. The minister reminded us that a new Parliament has been elected in Malawi, and the Scottish Parliament has played an important role in twinning with members of the Malawian Parliament and helping them to strengthen their roles. We have a particular role to play in helping members of the Opposition to hold their Government to account. That could happen the other way around, but we will leave that debate for another day.</p><p>Politics in Malawi is rather different from in our country. They do not have party politics in the same way as we do. Political parties tend to be based around regional or tribal groups, or around the personality of a leader. That makes for a different environment in which parliamentarians have to operate. We can do a lot to help Malawians to strengthen their Parliament as an institution and to help them to hold their Government to account.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland and Malawi"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>I realise that I am out of time.

Likewise, I always think that it is one of life&#8217;s great ironies that, as I drive up the M90 motorway through Fife&#8212;a journey that I make several times a week&#8212;I see signs to &#8220;The Secret Bunker&#8221;, which is obviously not so secret after all.</p><p>For 20 years, as Rod Campbell pointed out, the secret bunker has provided Scotland and Fife with one of our most unique and exciting visitor attractions, so I join colleagues in welcoming its reopening. Those who came before me spoke at length about the impressive refurbishment of the bunker, but it is worth stating again just how substantial the structure is. It lies 300 feet below ground and its entrance is hidden by a farmhouse. The bunker is a vast labyrinth of tunnels that cover an area the size of two football pitches.</p><p>As part of a variety of improvements, visitors will now be able to see a remodelled British Telecom room and the specialist equipment that was needed to feed an astonishing 2,800 phone lines to the bunker. Formerly closed rooms are to be opened and a number of information screens have been added, as well as an audio tour to improve the visitor experience.</p><p>As we heard from Alex Rowley, tourism is a hugely important industry to Fife. In 2012, tourist expenditure in Fife was worth &#163;313 million and tourism contributed 6,000 full-time jobs, with 2.8 million people enjoying 6.1 million days in the area. It is famed for its castles, fishing villages and golf courses, but the secret bunker gives Fife&#8212;and particularly its area of Fife&#8212;another weapon in its armoury to attract visitors.</p><p>Despite the fact that the bunker today looks almost identical to when it first opened, its role has changed dramatically over the years. On its construction in 1951, it operated as a military command centre and it would have served as the base for the Scottish government in the event of a nuclear attack. It is hard for the post-cold war generation to imagine how close the world came to nuclear Armageddon in the 1960s. The Cuban missile crisis and nuclear arms proliferation put the globe on the brink of all-out war.</p><p>Scotland played a key strategic role during the cold war, welcoming US submarines to Dunoon. Recently declassified documents show that the UK Government was preparing for nuclear attacks that would target Glasgow as the UK&#8217;s second city, RAF Lossiemouth and the Holy Loch marine base. As a result of the Communist threat, a number of subterranean fortifications were built throughout Scotland. Many survive to this day, but at present the secret bunker in Fife is the only one to have opened as a visitor attraction.</p><p>The cold war forms a key part of the history curriculum at both national 4 and 5 levels, and the secret bunker gives today&#8217;s students the opportunity to witness at first hand some of the preparations that were made for war. It is worth reflecting on how fortunate we are that the secret bunker never had to be used for its intended purpose, that the world survived the worrying period in its history that was the cold war and that we live, I hope, in happier times.</p><p>Fife has many historic attractions but nothing quite like the secret bunker. Inside it, history comes alive and visitors are offered a distinctive insight into the macabre world that was the cold war. The bunker has huge importance to Fife&#8217;s culture, economy and education and I join others in wishing it success for the next 20 years.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Secret Bunker"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13991.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13991", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Murdo Fraser", "member_id": "80514", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "Mid Scotland and Fife"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Murdo", "last_name": "Fraser", "left_house": "2011-03-23", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13991.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13991", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Murdo Fraser", "member_id": "80313", "entered_house": "2007-05-03", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "Mid Scotland and Fife"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Murdo", "last_name": "Fraser", "left_house": "2007-04-02", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13991.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13991", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Murdo Fraser", "member_id": "80034", "entered_house": "2003-05-01", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "Mid Scotland and Fife"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Murdo", "last_name": "Fraser", "left_house": "2003-03-31", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/13991.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "13991", "entered_reason": "replaced_in_region", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Murdo Fraser", "member_id": "80157", "entered_house": "2001-08-14", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "Mid Scotland and Fife"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Elizabeth", "last_name": "Smith", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>The announcement today is warmly welcomed.

As several members have said, the value of apprenticeships is immense and many of the themes that underpin the Wood commission are important in driving forward policy. In particular, there is a growing need to address the STEM subjects. Christine Grahame, who is not in the chamber just now, and Willie Coffey both said important things about STEM subjects and the difficulties that the science and technology industries encounter in attracting sufficient women.</p><p>Notwithstanding the success of programmes such as girls in energy, which is sponsored by Shell United Kingdom, concerns remain about the Scottish Qualifications Authority returns in recent school sessions, which show a drop in numbers taking subjects such as physics, with which there has been a problem in the last five school sessions. In mathematics, the numbers remain largely unchanged for boys, but that is not the case for girls&#8212;again, there has been a significant drop in the last few sessions.</p><p>I want to flag up concerns about the Scottish baccalaureate exams, which I believe have the potential to do something about the trend. At present, the take-up rate for the baccalaureate is exceedingly low. Indeed, the figure has fallen, with only 136 entries across Scotland for the current session. The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning said in a recent parliamentary answer to me that the Scottish baccalaureate was</p><p>&#8220;never intended to be a high uptake award&#8221;,</p><p>since it is primarily in place</p><p>&#8220;to meet the needs of ... our most able learners&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Written Answers, 19 August 2014; S4W-22291.]</p><p>I question the wisdom of saying that, because the whole point about baccalaureate exams is their interdisciplinary approach, especially when it comes to the dissertation work and practical disciplines. Those are the exact skills that many employers are looking for in their STEM graduates. The whole premise of the baccalaureate discipline is to have added value on the interdisciplinary front. We need to think about that very carefully.</p><p>That fall in the take-up of the baccalaureate is happening at the same time as subjects such as geology are coming out of the SQA examination diet altogether, yet geology is one of the burgeoning disciplines when it comes to Scotland&#8217;s thriving technology industries. There are serious issues there. We need to do much more on the training aspect that we all agree is so important to women in the labour market.</p><p>Secondly, there has been common agreement that many women are looking for much greater flexibility in the labour market. That, after all, is why there is cross-party agreement about the need to provide more and better-quality childcare. Of course, it would help if the Scottish Government&#8217;s economic modelling had been factually accurate. Instead, it was based on a theoretical trend, not on the specific labour market circumstances that apply to Scotland. Rhoda Grant was quite correct to point out the problem with that.</p><p>Childcare matters in terms of availability and reasonable cost, but also in terms of flexibility. That is why it is important that we do something about that availability on the flexible level. Jayne Baxter referred to issues in Mid Scotland and Fife in that regard. A group of campaigners in Glasgow is making the point that we cannot have the Scottish Government policy on full childcare provision unless we also harness the private sector availability of the public-private partnership mixes in nurseries. That provision cannot be delivered by dependence on the state sector alone. We need to take on board the fact that some of the state-funded nursery places do not have that flexibility because the provision is for only up to three hours a day and in some cases the school holidays are not covered. There are a lot of issues that we need to look at.</p><p>The third area of relative agreement is the huge role that colleges play in tackling the problem. One of the great success stories of colleges since the changes that took place in 1992 is their ability to cater for a wide diversity of courses&#8212;full time and part time&#8212;many of which are particularly suitable for women. However, as has been made clear this afternoon, it is impossible to come to any other conclusion than that the recent college cuts have disproportionately affected women. I do not want to hear any excuses about measuring part-time places against full-time equivalents. What matters is the trend against the same measure further back and, on that basis, the Scottish Government knows that the message is not a good one.</p><p>There are a lot of areas in which we agree on the principles behind the policies that we have to develop to ensure that women are not only much more available in the labour market but are available on a flexible basis that allows their individual skills to flourish in a way that perhaps has not been possible before.</p><p>The recent employment and GDP figures make it clear that Scotland is doing very well as part of the union and is benefiting from the combined economic policies of Holyrood and Westminster, as Jenny Marra and Alison McInnes said. It is essential to have those economies of scale that are important to investment and jobs and which help to provide the economic security that allows local economies to develop.</p><p>The potential for a boost in female participation rates is huge, provided that the whole of that capacity can be stimulated. That is why we are fully supportive of the unionist amendments in the names of Jenny Marra and Alison McInnes.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>Will the cabinet secretary give way on that point?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>The cabinet secretary is quite right about the need for flexibility.

We are also happy to support the Labour amendment, which congratulates EventScotland and Sir Jonathan Mills, as he completes his distinguished career at the Edinburgh festival.</p><p>Festivals are all about the celebration&#8212;or commemoration, in some cases&#8212;of a unique aspect of a community and its traditions. They are about a sense of belonging and purpose, and they usually have their origin in the identities of social, religious or geographical groupings. As the cabinet secretary and Patricia Ferguson said, festivals are full of enthusiasm and, particularly this year, bring a feel-good factor that invigorates the whole community.</p><p>Some festivals in Scotland have their history in early agriculture and celebrations of the change of seasons. The Gaelic Beltane fire festivals were all about encouraging the summer crops to grow, the Lammas festivals were about the power of the sun and the breaking of the first new bread following the harvesting of the grain, and the Gaelic interpretation of the Saturnalian festivals, which the Latin poet Catullus described, was all about celebrating the bounty of the land. Of course, in more modern times we have the very Scottish interpretation of the autumn celebration of Hallowe&#8217;en.</p><p>Many early festivals, particularly in the middle ages, grew out of religious crusades and the pilgrimages that people made to celebrate the life and work of saints. Many such festivals continue today. For those of more pagan views, there were other festivals, some of which dated from much further back in time. For example, archaeologists think that the standing stones at Callanish are there because some of the earliest inhabitants believed that the stones would act as a kind of astronomical observatory that would allow them to watch and worship the movement of the sun and the stars. Like some of the other festivals that I have mentioned, they were a monument to the link between man and his environment. Next week, when we debate the Historic Environment Scotland Bill, we will be thinking about how we understand all that in a more modern setting.</p><p>The cabinet secretary mentioned the traditional music festivals, many of which have their foundations in iconic Scottish instruments, such as the harp and the bagpipes, or the very best of Celtic and Gaelic songs and poetry. The festivals are a key means of understanding Scotland&#8217;s rich history and how it has shaped our environment.</p><p>Festivals that have a sporting edge also have a rich history&#8212;I was interested in Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s suggestion that we establish a new sports festival. The oldest Highland games come from Ceres, in Fife, and are of particular interest this year, because they were the result of a charter that was awarded to the villagers because of their loyalty to Robert the Bruce at the battle of Bannockburn. Highland games are Scottish in character but international in outreach&#8212;and increasingly so, as we see when we look at the countries in which they are copied and the lists of competitors in Scottish events, who come from all over the world. Indeed, at the Crieff highland games, on Sunday, I understand that that great Lancastrian, Freddie Flintoff, will proudly wear his kilt as he tosses the caber.</p><p>The cabinet secretary was absolutely right when she said recently that culture has a worth in itself, which should not be subservient to economic or financial gain. That is an important context as we consider the intrinsic value of our festivals, which define who we are and the relationships that we have with our past, as well as the relationships that will help to mould our future.</p><p>Nowadays, as the cabinet secretary said, our festivals are as diverse and vibrant as those anywhere else in the world. In the fields of music, art, science, film, food, leisure and religion, they reach far and wide, well beyond our local communities and into every corner of the world. As such, they are an increasingly popular attraction for visitors as well as Scots.</p><p>The Edinburgh festival epitomises that breadth and depth of cultural experience. Since its inception in 1947, it has grown in size and stature, and it now encompasses just under 3,000 shows every August. It is still, for the most part, capable of attracting world class artistes on every stage.</p><p>When I was growing up in the 1960s and 1970s&#8212;I am older than the cabinet secretary&#8212;I was privileged to hear a great deal about the Edinburgh festival and its musical direction, because Dick Telfer, who, along with Alexander Gibson, Ian Rodger and Ainslie Millar, founded Scottish Opera in 1962, was a family friend of my parents and grandparents. The ethos on which they went on to found Scottish Opera is one that continues to be admired around the world and that has always had the ability to ensure that Scotland is looking outward as well as nurturing the very best of our home-grown talent.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>Yes, indeed, and it can be enhanced, because it is very much in Scotland&#8217;s tradition to be outward looking as well as to do our best for our home-grown talent.</p><p>I hope that that mix is something that we can always have, particularly, dare I say it, in the context of whatever happens in the referendum. Whoever we are, whatever political party we support, that mix is something that binds us all together. These are very important strands.</p><p>Culture is always at its best when it can make Scotland relevant in the international community in a way that celebrates the best of our nation while challenging our imagination and creativity and strengthening our cultural and social future. If any proof were needed, one need look no further than Glasgow this summer. Not only did that city lay on a highly successful Commonwealth games, it laid on a terrific cultural experience through festival 2014 and culture 2014. Much of it was free to enter and it went hand in glove with the traditions and colour of the Commonwealth nations.</p><p>Glasgow excelled itself in so many different ways this summer and we debated the legacy in the Parliament last week. The cultural legacy is part of that and I have no doubt that those two festivals will be a reason why many visitors will return to Glasgow in the years ahead.</p><p>Festivals are an integral part of any nation, whether they are held in very small communities and organised on a shoestring or in large communities. They are often the means by which communities bind themselves together. They matter to the economic fabric of Scotland and, more than that, they define who we are and, as such, we must celebrate them and do everything we can to support them.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-07", "body": "<p>I begin by reiterating congratulations to all those who helped to make the Commonwealth games such a successful and, indeed, memorable event. Whether it was our outstanding athletes, the numerous officials and administrators, the volunteers, the UK and Scottish Governments, Glasgow City Council, the police or the armed forces, they all deserve glowing praise for the excellent work that they did.</p><p>Over the 11 days we witnessed competition of the very highest order, so we were perhaps not surprised to hear Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, tell us that they were</p><p>&#8220;the stand-out Games in the history of the movement.&#8221;</p><p>That is a very considerable compliment. In that vein, we have absolutely no problem in supporting the motion and, indeed, the Labour amendment. We also welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement regarding Largs.</p><p>I do not think that anybody could doubt the extent of the challenge that we face when it comes to the delivery of a meaningful and lasting legacy. I say that because I do not think that it is easy to define the parameters of the debate. The word &#8220;legacy&#8221; itself is not terribly easy to define, particularly in its qualitative sense, and therefore I do not think that it is particularly easy to measure. That has perhaps been why people have moved away from the issue for some games in the past.</p><p>A legacy must, by necessity, include some aspects of quantitative measure&#8212;for example, increasing the number of people who participate in sport and taking on board the Scottish Government&#8217;s initiative to try to ensure that more women take up sport; and we can obviously also measure reductions in obesity totals and how much additional money is raised. However, the legacy has to be much more than that, and I think that that is the tougher call. I am not sure that it is the politicians&#8217; job to say what that should be, but what I think is our job and what we have to do in line with other stakeholders such as sportscotland, Glasgow 2014, local authorities and so on is to deliver the right circumstances that will help communities to develop the more qualitative aspects of the legacy. Stewart Harris said it is about &#8220;building capacity&#8221; and he is right.</p><p>Thus, it is not enough to provide top-class facilities for sport. At a recent meeting of the cross-party group on sport we heard that 50 per cent of senior schools in Scotland now have excellent sports facilities&#8212;we have all seen many of them&#8212;but that at times quite a lot of them are still underused. What is important&#8212;the cabinet secretary referred to this in the context of Largs&#8212;is to change public perception, culture and attitudes to ensure that there is sporting participation and development.</p><p>The games revealed some inspirational examples that can facilitate a shift in perspective. There was the extraordinary achievement of England&#8217;s Steve Way, who said on television that in 2007 he weighed 16 and a half stone and smoked 20 cigarettes a day. However, at Glasgow 2014 he finished tenth in the marathon, breaking the British over-40s record, which had stood since 1979. Way&#8217;s transformation shows the ability of sport to change lives if sufficient determination is there.</p><p>In addition, who can forget the delightful Erraid Davies, the 13-year-old Shetland swimmer who won bronze in the 100m para-breaststroke, which showed how much can be done with even modest means? I am sure that our colleague Tavish Scott, who is here, will say a little bit more about Erraid Davies. However, she trains in Brae in a pool that is about a third of the length of the 50m pool in which she won her medal. She has proved just what can be done without necessarily having world-class facilities in which to train. When she was interviewed, she spoke of her inspiration at primary school. If I may, I will focus on the Conservative amendment, which makes a statement about the crucial role that primary schools will have if we are to deliver the legacy in full.</p><p>As I understand it, there has been significant progress in recent months on meeting the physical education target in schools, and sportscotland has worked hard with Education Scotland to support the PE continuous professional development programme, which will ensure that much more is done to tackle the shortfall in the number of primary teachers who are fully qualified in PE and in sport. At a recent session of the Health and Sport Committee, sportscotland made it very clear that the issue is much more about the quality of delivery rather than the amount.</p><p>I suggest to the cabinet secretary that we need to do a little more to ensure that local authorities know exactly what is going on in their schools, because a recent freedom of information response suggested that a worrying number of them do not know what the situation is in their schools, how many teachers are fully trained and so on. It would be helpful if the cabinet secretary could provide some information on when she expects to be able to update that data and how we can move forward on that.</p><p>The games also proved Scotland&#8217;s depth of sporting interest and ability&#8212;something that was always very dear to the heart of the late Margo MacDonald as she chaired the cross-party group on sport. We may be a football-mad nation from time to time, but the games have proved what else we can do, in the so-called minority sports. We won three golds and a bronze in lawn bowls and a remarkable 13 medals in judo, and I noticed yesterday that squash and netball both shot up in the rankings of spectator sports. There is an issue there about the broadcasting of sport. I give credit to the BBC, which has managed to develop a lot of minority sports to a level that we have not seen before. The lessons about broadcasting are something that we can develop in the future.</p><p>I am running out of time. The legacy has to run deep. It involves some difficult concepts, but they are the most important ones if we are to provide what will be a meaningful and lasting legacy.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-10736.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;, and believes that, in line with recent advice from Scotland&#8217;s sporting bodies, the key policies that will deliver a permanent and meaningful legacy are those that focus on the improvement in the qualitative sporting experience for primary school-age children when they first develop their interest in, and enthusiasm for, sporting activity&#8221;.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Legacy)"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>At what stage will the Scottish Government be able to tell us the local authority breakdown of the 500 additional health workers?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Health Visitors (Training)"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>I add a very strong thank you and congratulations to everybody who was involved in the Commonwealth games, which were outstanding.

The staff who have worked and who currently work at the hospital have provided first-class care&#8212;life-saving care in many cases&#8212;to the local community over the past 100 years.</p><p>Of course, 2014 is a big year for national commemorations, but it is important not to forget that many local commemorations will be taking place on 10 July, which marks the 100th anniversary of the opening of Perth royal infirmary.</p><p>Unquestionably, our public health services have come a very long way in the intervening 100 years. Life expectancy, for example, has increased from 49 and 45 years for women and men respectively at the turn of the last century to 80 and 76 for women and men today; the infant mortality rate has fallen by over 100 per 1,000 births; and if, in 1914, pneumonia, influenza and tuberculosis were among the most common causes of death, they are now among the least common.</p><p>Today, on the news, we hear about a quadruple amputee being accepted for a pioneering operation in Leeds to provide her with two new hands. In the past few weeks, two of our major Scottish universities have continued to make their outstanding contributions to the provision of ground-breaking cancer treatment.</p><p>The first half of the 20th century saw major improvements in access to, and standards within, the system of public health provision, some of which built upon the Education (Scotland) Act 1908, which provided for compulsory medical inspection of schoolchildren. Major reasons for those significant improvements are not only advances in medical science and technology and better education, but the dedicated professionalism of our doctors and nurses and the vast numbers of support staff who do so much for our patients. It is to them that we pay tribute this evening.</p><p>For Perthshire, the development of a national health service saw the Perth city and county infirmary completed in 1838 by city architect William Macdonald Mackenzie. The hospital saw multiple changes but eventually proved far too small for the requirements of the growing city. James Miller was then commissioned to design a new hospital and began work in 1912 on the Glasgow Road site, two years later seeing the new Perth royal infirmary open its doors.</p><p>Perth royal infirmary was opened by King George V and Queen Mary as part of their Scotland-wide tour. Accompanied by the troopers of the Scottish Horse Guards, the royal couple paraded along County Place amidst a sea of local support. It was a time when women did not have the franchise, and there were considerable protests that day from leaflet-wielding suffragettes. Reports in some of the excellent archives held in the hospital state that a startled King George was confronted by some of the radical ladies, who latched on to the car and were unceremoniously dragged away. Fortunately, those incidents did not spoil the day too much and Perth royal infirmary was opened as planned.</p><p>The intervening 100 years have seen many changes. With health services becoming increasingly centralised as a result of the rationalisation of services at national level, there are significant challenges for PRI with regard to its future place in the community. As such, many residents across Perthshire and Kinross-shire, and many staff within PRI, have on an on-going basis expressed their concerns that the removal of services such as the maternity ward, paediatrics, pathology and weekend surgery will have a detrimental effect on the future of Perth royal infirmary as an acute district general hospital. That is something that MSPs on all sides of the chamber have fought against.</p><p>I hope that this centenary anniversary will not only celebrate the distinguished past of the hospital but reaffirm the commitment from NHS Tayside to ensure that Perth royal infirmary remains a fully-equipped acute district general hospital to serve what is a quickly growing population of Perthshire and Kinross-shire.</p><p>It is very clear that Perth royal infirmary has been a precious asset for the local community. As well as providing many local jobs and high-quality healthcare throughout its 100-year history, it has brought many people together. The centenary provides an opportunity to thank and acknowledge the staff of PRI, both past and present. The first-class medical care that is given to patients from numerous communities and backgrounds is a testament to their professionalism and dedication.</p><p>Looking to the future, we face huge challenges in the realms of providing specialised healthcare, which must reflect changing needs and changing social structures. Those challenges have been acutely felt at PRI, and we know only too well that there are deep-seated concerns among members of the local community about what that could mean for the future of the hospital, particularly as regards the availability of certain health services and staffing levels.</p><p>If the highly successful hands off PRI campaign taught us anything, it was that there is a very strong bond between the hospital and the local community, and I am sure that we are all clear that nothing must happen to undermine the ability of PRI&#8217;s staff to provide what has always been a first-class service.

That is not to say that either body has failed in its duties; far from it. There have been warm words about the staff in both organisations and we would echo those words.

What a momentous moment we have arrived at in our country, when in just four weeks we will have the one opportunity of a lifetime to decide what kind of country we want to live in and what kind of country we wish to build for future generations.</p><p>On Thursday 18 September we will, each of us, have the opportunity to make a choice between two futures: a Scotland that controls her vast resources and puts them to use to build a better, more prosperous and fairer country, or a Scotland whose decisions continue to be taken by out-of-touch Westminster Governments that we do not vote for, which place a ceiling on our ambitions and squander our resources. Aspiration to something better, or the same old same old from Westminster&#8212;that is the choice of two futures that faces all the people who live and work in Scotland on 18 September.</p><p>Many areas of importance to our daily lives have been discussed this afternoon. In the time that remains to me I, as a member of the Welfare Reform Committee, would like to direct my remarks to the important issue of welfare. What has emerged very clearly from the inception of the work of that committee over the past two years or so is that the welfare system that is, sad to say, still controlled by Westminster, is no longer fit for purpose, and is being dismantled before our very eyes, with the safety net that should be embodied in it being removed by stealth. What other conclusion could be reached by people&#8212;people at home, who have the notion of the common weal&#8212;when we look at the deeply damaging impacts of so-called welfare reform on individuals and families across Scotland?</p><p>Who could not feel diminished, as a human being, by Westminster policies that force people who have motor neurone disease to take in lodgers in order to avoid paying the bedroom tax, or that harass recently bereaved widows to leave their homes of many decades because the UK Government says that they have too many rooms? I see the Tory front bench laughing, as they did in the debate last week. I do not think that that is funny; I do not think that the lady who came to the Welfare Reform Committee to give evidence on that very issue thinks that it is funny.</p><p>Who could not feel diminished by Westminster&#8217;s work capability assessments&#8212;which were, of course, introduced by the previous Labour Government, with the help of Tony Blair&#8217;s friend the Tory Lord Freud, and which have been kept on by the Tories? Those assessments turn medical orthodoxies on their head by finding vulnerable ill people somehow fit for work and forcing them to go through hoops in efforts to maintain their health, their sanity and their dignity.</p><p>Who would not feel diminished by Westminster Government policies that will see more than 100,000 disabled Scots lose some or all of their disability benefits as a result of the roll-out of the new personal independence payment&#8212;a benefit that was introduced by the current UK Tory-Liberal Government and which Labour plans to keep?</p><p>Of course, a welfare system should have the objective of supporting people into work that is paid at a decent rate, but at the same time, who would wish to choose a society in which a bit of help is taken away from some of its most vulnerable members? That is the miserable, rotten place that we have reached under the union. For me, that is the unacceptable price that our most vulnerable members of society&#8212;our poorest members of society&#8212;are now paying for the union.</p><p>Scotland is wealthier per head than the UK, France and Japan, yet we have in the past year alone seen 22,387 children having to rely on food banks in order to eat. The country has vast resources both in human talent and natural resources, but if we stay on the Westminster path, we will see 100,000 more children being pushed into poverty by 2020.</p><p>It does not have to be that way; we cannot, each of us, in all conscience allow it to continue to be so. This is the opportunity of a lifetime&#8212;the opportunity to say that we want a decent society that has fairness at its heart.

The silence of the Labour Party today speaks volumes. It will do nothing differently from the Tories, except on the bedroom tax. Shame on Labour.</p><p>What we are seeing before our very eyes is the dismantling of the welfare system and the removal of the safety net that should be embodied in it. What kind of rotten, miserable society is being created by a Westminster system that harasses recently bereaved widows to leave their home of many decades or pay a tax simply because there is a spare room; that says to those with motor neurone disease that, to avoid the bedroom tax, they should take in a lodger; that encourages the description of people with long-term conditions who are unable to work as workshy; and which forces decent, hard-working civil servants to make judgments of Solomon about their fellow citizens in accordance with Kafkaesque criteria that are designed to lock those citizens out of the little help to which they are entitled?</p><p>As the motion states, the &#8220;damaging and destructive impact&#8221; of those Westminster policies is being felt by communities and families the length and breadth of Scotland. In the time available, I want to focus in particular on the impact on the disabled and children&#8212;two of the most vulnerable groups in our society.</p><p>As we have heard, today the Scottish Government published a comprehensive report on the financial impacts of welfare reform on disabled people in Scotland. It makes shocking reading. It is clear from the report that more than 100,000 people in Scotland will lose disability benefits. As the Deputy First Minister has pointed out, that will not only mean a loss of financial support but have a devastating impact on the quality of life of disabled people and their families.</p><p>In paragraph 2.1 of its helpful briefing for today&#8217;s debate, Inclusion Scotland says:</p><p>&#8220;It is clear that the prime motivation behind the replacement of Disability Living Allowance ... by the Personal Independence Payment ... has not been empowering disabled people to the same freedom, choice, dignity and control as other citizens to participate in society and live an ordinary life. Rather it has been about cutting the welfare budget.&#8221;</p><p>There we have it in a nutshell: Westminster&#8217;s treatment of disabled people in 21st century Scotland is to be determined solely by Treasury bean counters.</p><p>The Tories are so interested in the possible ramifications for disabled people that they seem to be having a little chat and telling jokes to one another. This is an important debate, and I am sure that people across Scotland will have noted the Tories&#8217; lack of interest in the interests of disabled people. We should recall that, when the Welfare Reform Act 2012 was going through the legislative process, the Tory-Liberal Democrat Government&#8212;oh, I see that the Liberal Democrat member has gone as well&#8212;made it very clear&#8212;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>I am sorry, but no.

A yes vote on 18 September will enable Scotland to halt the abolition of DLA and the cuts, and, over time, to put in place a new welfare system for Scotland that is fit for purpose and progressive, which provides a safety net through which individuals cannot fall, which will not see more than 100,000 children pushed into poverty by 2020 and which will not think it somehow acceptable that in the past year alone 22,387 children have had to rely on food banks to be able to eat.</p><p>In that respect, I want to mention again the very curious statement, highlighted by my colleague Kevin Stewart, that was made by the official better together outfit up in Aberdeenshire. Those people seem to think that in 21st century Scotland increased recourse to food banks is not only acceptable but laudable. How can they stoop so low? What a miserable lot they are. Do they have no respect for basic human dignity? Scotland is a wealthy country; it is wealthier per head than France, Japan and indeed the UK as a whole.

In so doing, I pay tribute to the care that doctors, nurses and all the other staff of PRI have provided to the people of Perth, Perthshire and neighbouring Kinross-shire down through the years. I also commend the volunteers who give up their time to make the lives of patients and visitors easier as they pass through the hospital.</p><p>Perth royal infirmary grew out of the Perth city and county infirmary, which was opened in 1838 and whose elegant main building now houses Perth&#8217;s famous A K Bell library. The records for PRI show how the cost of hospital building has increased over the years. In that regard, it may interest members to note that while the cost of purchasing the land for and building the original hospital, which we now know as the A K Bell library, was a little over &#163;6,812, the new PRI that was built in Taymount Terrace in 1914 cost &#163;36,000. That sum was secured largely from donations, subscriptions and fundraising.</p><p>That figure can be contrasted with the &#163;5&#160;million that was spent on the clinical research centre that was opened in the infirmary in 2006 by the University of Dundee, in conjunction with which PRI gained teaching hospital status. The centre concentrates on chronic diseases such as asthma.</p><p>In the year in which we commemorate 100 years since the outbreak of the first world war, it is appropriate to note that, further to the hospital being constructed on the Cornhill estate between 1911 and 1914, it was pressed into use straight away as a war hospital during that conflict.</p><p>As Liz Smith said, many buildings have been added on to the hospital. In 1926-27, the maternity block was added. There were major developments in the 1960s and new wards were built into the hillside at the end of the 1970s. In the late 1980s, an extension was constructed to provide accident and emergency facilities, and a cancer care centre was established in 2007.</p><p>PRI is close to people&#8217;s hearts not because of any particular connection to any of those buildings but because of what they mean for the local provision of healthcare to the citizens of Perth, Perthshire and beyond. When maternity services were under threat in the early years of the last decade&#8212;I am sure that Liz Smith will remember that battle well&#8212;folk took to the streets in great numbers as part of the community-led hands off PRI campaign. Unfortunately, despite the wishes of the local community and the best efforts of all those who were involved in the campaign&#8212;I see that the local MSP John Swinney is here tonight; he was very much involved in that campaign, as was I, because I was the local Westminster MP for Perth at the time&#8212;consultant-led maternity services were still transferred to Ninewells hospital in Dundee.</p><p>However, a partial success was achieved in that, although at one point there was a very real threat that there would be no maternity services at all in Perth, the hands off PRI campaign secured a community maternity unit staffed by midwives. I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the women who gave up so much of their time to spearhead that fantastic community campaign, and to the midwives and all the other national health service staff for ensuring that women could still give birth at PRI. As we speak, the community maternity unit is celebrating its 10th anniversary, and I join in the congratulations to the outstanding team based there on their sterling service to women and families throughout Perthshire and Kinross-shire.</p><p>There was a period not so long ago when it seemed that the change in the way in which health services in Tayside were being provided meant that the flow of facilities was always away from Perth to Dundee. However, a number of developments in recent years have reversed that trend. The cancer care centre has been established in Perth and, following another long-standing campaign, there is now a dialysis unit providing a satellite service from Ninewells, thus enabling Perthshire kidney patients to get access to a treatment facility nearer to their homes. We must all monitor the situation and be quick to spot opportunities in the years ahead.</p><p>I say a very big thank you to everyone involved with the PRI, now and over the past 100 years, from those of us who live in Perthshire. I speak as someone who has received both in-patient and out-patient treatment at the PRI. On all occasions, the level of care has been excellent. I hope that the PRI continues to grow and develop and to serve the community for many more years to come.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Perth Royal Infirmary&#8217;s Centenary"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>I was pleased to note the general reference in the statement to equality issues, which are important.

Like Alex Fergusson, I speak as a member of the cross-party group on armed forces veterans, where I have taken a particular interest in the welfare of our armed forces veterans since my election to this Parliament, just as I did when I was a member of the Westminster Parliament. I was involved there in a number of defence-related issues, including the widely supported but, sadly, subsequently unsuccessful campaign to save the Black Watch and the other Scottish regiments. Sadly, that campaign fell on deaf ears with the UK Government of the day.</p><p>It is fitting that we are having this debate today, in advance of armed forces day being held in Stirling on Saturday, and in this year when we remember in particular those who fell in the first world war in the fields of Flanders and beyond. What a terrible price was paid by so many millions of young men, and what a terrible impact the war had on communities the length and breadth of Scotland and of every country across the European continent and the wider world.</p><p>As the minister said, we also look back this year, on the 70th anniversary of the D day landings, to the bravery of those who came ashore on the beaches of France to liberate a continent. There really are no words properly to describe those heroic actions and the sacrifice involved. Each of us can ensure, however, that those who have served their country are treated with the utmost respect and dignity when they leave the armed forces. Here in Scotland, it is a matter of some pride that we have a dedicated minister for veterans to ensure that, as far as we can, with the limited powers that this Parliament has, we can support the 400,000 or so veterans in Scotland. As we have heard, the Scottish Government has made significant contributions to Veterans Scotland and, through it, to a number of important ex-service charities to support their excellent work.</p><p>The 2012 &#8220;Our Commitments&#8221; report&#8212;to give it its full title, &#8220;Our Commitments: Scottish Government Support for the Armed Forces Community in Scotland&#8221;&#8212;provides, inter alia, for a co-ordinated approach across Government to planning for and delivering devolved services for our armed forces community. As Christina McKelvie said, it is important that we include within that the families of members of our armed forces and of veterans, as they, too, play a very significant role, albeit not on the front line. There is provision in the report for regular meetings with Veterans Scotland, and there is assistance to NHS boards and other public sector providers.</p><p>There are recurrent themes in the work of the cross-party group, one of which concerns health matters. It is very welcome that there is provision for priority NHS treatment for veterans and both serving and retired reservists with what is defined as a service-related condition. At recent cross-party group meetings, there has been discussion about the parameters of &#8220;service-related condition&#8221;, in particular where mental health issues present; they might present not immediately, but some time down the line. Perhaps the veterans minister could look at that area in conjunction with his ministerial colleagues in the health portfolio to see what can be done to ensure that the implementation of the policy is as clear cut as it can be for all concerned.</p><p>Reference has been made to other excellent provision for veterans in the health field, including specialist mental health services, in conjunction with the NHS and Combat Stress, and the NHS armed forces champion in each NHS board. A leaflet has been provided to raise understanding among GPs about what it means to be a veteran and the issues that may present.</p><p>In addition to the important area of health, housing is another key area that is frequently raised at the cross-party group. I am pleased to note that a number of initiatives have been promoted by the Scottish Government, including the introduction of proposed legislation on homelessness to ensure that employment and residence connected to the armed forces constitute a local connection for the purposes of the legislation, and that there is priority access to the Scottish Government&#8217;s low-cost initiative for the first-time buyers shared equity scheme. The minister referred to the 50-home unit in Glasgow and, I believe, to developments in Carnoustie. Those are very much to be welcomed, and they will include social and transitional housing.</p><p>Welfare issues have also been raised at the cross-party group. Sadly, although veterans face many considerable challenges to do with welfare, the Parliament can do very little about that at present, as we simply do not have welfare powers, which reside with Westminster&#8212;but, hopefully, not for much longer, further to what I hope is a yes vote on 18 September.</p><p>We have heard about the veterans champions in local authorities. It might be timely to consider that again, to see what further awareness could be raised about, and access facilitated to, those champions. They do a power of work, but their role could be further enhanced and explained to the veterans community that they are there to serve.</p><p>I wish well the Scottish veterans commissioner, whoever they may be, in the new post that the Scottish Government has created to bring a greater focus to all the areas that we have discussed this afternoon. That acts as a significant marker of the Scottish Government&#8217;s absolute commitment to doing right by veterans in Scotland and ensuring that they receive the help that they need.

As we have heard, it was introduced by the SNP Government in 2007 and launched the following year and&#8212;I am happy to say&#8212;involves taking money that has been recovered from criminals under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and reinvesting it back in young people and the communities in which they live. Its benefit is twofold, in that it provides young people with worthwhile local activities, particularly but not exclusively in sport, and helps to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour by giving young people a different road to travel, instead of their being caught up, as a small minority are, in causing trouble in their communities. I believe that it is working to provide a different path that can make a key difference to the lives of young people who are desperate for real chances.</p><p>Although there has been some debate this afternoon about the Scotland-wide nature of the programme, I think that that is very important, because crime and antisocial behaviour are not limited to certain geographical areas. The programme does not discriminate on the basis of postcodes, but considers applications on a case-by-case basis to determine whether need has been established. That is only fair; after all, it must be accepted that young people in all parts of Scotland need a chance.</p><p>Football features widely in the sporting opportunities that the programme facilitates. As my colleague James Dornan said, cashback resources can also be used for girls football. Such projects might be less common at the moment, but I hope that that will not be the case in the future. In fact, cashback money is helping to fund Scotland&#8217;s only girl-specific football scheme&#8212;the girls football academy at Lornshill academy in Alloa, which is being piloted for the women&#8217;s section of the Scottish Football Association. The fact is that girls are already participating in football in schools across Scotland, and local authorities that I understand might have been a bit sceptical when the project in Alloa began are now considering setting up their own girls football academies. I very much look forward to that happening in the years to come.</p><p>Another sport that has attracted cashback programme funds in the wee county of Clackmannanshire is basketball. The unique jump2it programme, which is supported by the cashback scheme, provides education through sporting initiatives that are delivered to primary schools across Scotland by the charity Scottish Sports Futures. In addition to that scheme, the Glasgow Rocks professional basketball team has provided information on healthy lifestyles to primary school pupils, including over the past year 900 pupils at 16 schools in Clackmannanshire. Moreover, more than 300 youngsters in the wee county created more than 30 teams to compete in a regional tournament that was delivered by Clackmannanshire active schools and sports development team. Four teams of girls and four teams of boys won the exciting opportunity to attend a Glasgow Rocks game and, in fact, played their finals at half-time, with the girls&#8217; winner being the team from Tillicoultry primary school and the boys&#8217; winner being Abercromby primary school. Both teams were crowned Clackmannanshire&#8217;s jump2it champions.</p><p>Those examples represent the real stories behind the dry statistics of the cashback programme that some of us have got involved with this afternoon, and which are set out in the lengthy evaluation document. The real story behind cashback for communities is the opportunity that is provided to young people to realise their potential, so I congratulate Clackmannanshire Council on its 110 per cent enthusiastic take-up of the project, and I congratulate all the teachers and others who have been involved in delivering it.</p><p>Time does not permit me to discuss or to go into any detail on the other exciting projects that are going on across Perthshire and Fife. However, I will say that, further to an oral question that I put to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice last December, I am pleased to note that Fife has benefited from &#163;1.3&#160;million in cashback investment and more than 55,000 activities and opportunities for young Fifers.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to say what a fantastic initiative the cashback for communities programme is. It is a credit to the SNP that it has ensured that this unique approach has been rolled out so extensively and successfully. At the end of the day, there can surely be no more important goal in life than to do everything we possibly can to ensure that young lives are nourished and that young people are nurtured so that they have confidence in themselves and can realise their potential.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Cashback for Communities"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/25085.jpeg", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "image_width": 99, "person_id": "25085", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Annabelle Ewing", "member_id": "80516", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Mid Scotland and Fife"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Willie", "last_name": "Rennie", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>I share the First Minister&#8217;s ambition for us to use the energy from the referendum for the good of politics in the long run.

Human nature is innately good, generous and open. That is why I have never warmed to nationalism, as I have always viewed its central philosophy as inward rather than outward looking. It divides rather than unites. I recognise that not all supporters of independence regard themselves as isolationists, but the effect and outcome of their desired destination feed that philosophy.</p><p>Of course Britain is not perfect, but it is not as imperfect as the nationalists would like people to believe. The fact that it is not perfect does not mean that I want to break it up and the fact that I want change does not mean that I want just any change that happens to come along.</p><p>There is a lot to be proud of in our United Kingdom, a lot that helps people to achieve great things. Let us take science and innovation. Even though Scottish universities form only one tenth of the UK university base, they get 13 per cent of UK funding against a population share of 8 per cent. That is 50 per cent more than elsewhere in the UK. That happens because of the combination of talent and access to that bigger pool of funding.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>Members of our party are free to vote as they wish.

Scotland and Scottish businesses have been able to take good advantage of our natural food and drink products, to innovate and to add value to Scottish produce. The global network of 270 UK embassies, consulates and trade missions supports those businesses. In the past four years, UK exports have risen by 28 per cent to Brazil, by 55 per cent to India and by 115 per cent to China. Our ambition should be that those embassies step up their work for us to open doors to new markets, not close their doors to Scotland.</p><p>Let us take the single market, regulatory regime and currency that the First Minister refused to talk about.

That trade is worth 270,000 jobs to Scotland.</p><p>Those examples speak to the United Kingdom as a great platform from which Scots can be all they can be.</p><p>I do not want a Scotland that retreats from other countries, cutting two thirds of our overseas representation just when there has never been a better time to promote Scottish excellence and businesses. I do not want a Scotland that cuts the opportunities for Scottish universities to keep the huge funding boost that they get from the UK at the moment when the 21st century western economies demand more innovation.

If we want to do something different, sometimes we cannot because we do not have the necessary financial power. Our plan sets out proposals for the Scottish Parliament to raise the majority of the money that it spends, through the transfer of income tax, inheritance tax and capital gains tax, as well as the proceeds from corporation tax.</p><p>That means that if we want to cut taxes for those on low and middle incomes, as we have done at Westminster, that can happen. If we want to increase childcare, which the SNP members resisted for so long but which we have made progress on, we can raise the money to pay for it if that is required.

However, it is important that we are aware throughout the year of the work that is done by our armed forces and for our veterans.</p><p>I am sure that all of us have met veterans for whom the transition to civilian life has not been easy, for a host of reasons. For some, experiences of combat have left mental and physical scars. That underlines the importance of the support that they receive from organisations and charities that work with veterans and the need for our public services to provide the right support for veterans. I am sure that the veterans commissioner will have an important role to play on that issue.</p><p>We recognise the challenges that many veterans face, which the minister outlined, but it is also important to recognise the great contribution to our communities that many veterans make. It is right to emphasise that. As Ken Macintosh said, stereotypes need to be challenged. A number of other members have also made that important point.</p><p>As I represent North East Scotland, members would expect me to talk about the vital role played in our community by the Gordon Highlanders. Gordon Highlander veterans make a great contribution to our area and our communities. The majority of the regiment&#8217;s ranks were made up of men from Aberdeen and the north-east, who fought on battlefields across the world. In August 1949, the regiment was given the freedom of the city of Aberdeen. Sir Winston Churchill said:</p><p>&#8220;There is no doubt they are the finest regiment in the world&#8221;.</p><p>In October 2011, I was privileged to attend the unveiling in Aberdeen&#8217;s Castlegate of a commemorative statue to the Gordon Highlanders regiment, which Aberdeen City Council commissioned. The sculpture of two soldiers is magnificent. It was unveiled by Prince Charles, who served as colonel-in-chief of the Gordon Highlanders and is a patron of the Gordon Highlanders museum.</p><p>The museum plays an important role in the city and a tremendous amount of work has been invested in making it the excellent resource that it is, not only as a place to visit and to learn about the Gordon Highlanders but as a centre for learning and research. It focuses on the contribution that soldiers made and it reminds us of the contribution that we must make to veterans&#8217; lives today.</p><p>I pay particular tribute to the tremendous work that has been done by Lieutenant General Sir Peter Graham, formerly commanding officer of the first battalion of the Gordon Highlanders and subsequently general officer commanding Scotland, who has been instrumental in making the museum the great success that it is. He also has a personal mission to help our veterans in today&#8217;s community.</p><p>The museum is important to celebrating the history of the Gordon Highlanders, but it also offers activities for families and children and learning experiences for pupils, who can find out more about what life was like for soldiers in the Gordon Highlanders. That outreach work is important for our younger generations, as it is for all of us who have lived in times of relative peace and who have&#8212;fortunately&#8212;not had the experiences that our grandparents had, because it ensures that we understand better how that peace was secured and empathise more with the crucial role that our armed forces play today.</p><p>The work of the Gordon Highlanders museum receives fantastic support from our local community in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. It is therefore right that, on a broader level, the work of Poppyscotland, Erskine and other charities that work with veterans across Scotland receives support from the Parliament and the Scottish Government. I am pleased that the minister outlined exactly that kind of approach in his speech and that it is certainly outlined in the motion.</p><p>It is good that the Scottish Government is taking a strategic approach to that work and that we can look to progress with the appointment of the Scottish veterans commissioner so that, as a society, we ensure that our veterans have not only the gratitude that they so richly deserve from us but, crucially, the support that many of them need from our communities and public services.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Armed Forces and Veteran Communities"}, {"date": "2014-06-05", "body": "<p>I, too, congratulate Alex Johnstone on securing today&#8217;s debate, and I also acknowledge his commitment to the wider links between Japan and Scotland through his convenership of the cross-party group on Japan. I will focus my remarks on Aberdeen&#8217;s link with Japan, although we all enjoyed Mr Buchanan&#8217;s speech.</p><p>Mr Johnstone is quite right to bring to our attention the importance of the historic link between Aberdeen and Japan that Thomas Blake Glover contributed to through the development of Japanese industry, as part of which he played a role in the development of the important firm of Mitsubishi. Of course, Thomas Blake Glover&#8217;s contribution to commerce in Japan went far broader than that. As Lewis Macdonald said, he helped to found the Japan Brewery Company, which became the major Kirin Brewery Company, which distributes its products around the world, including to Aberdeen. He also promoted the mining and rail industries in Japan. He engaged in enterprise in a range of fields.</p><p>Therefore, it is right that Thomas Blake Glover&#8217;s achievements should be properly recognised in this country, including through Glover house in Aberdeen, as they undoubtedly are in Japan, where I understand that Glover garden house in Nagasaki attracts 2 million visitors every year. People in Aberdeen should be aware and proud of his achievements, which should inspire more of our people to achieve great things around the world. I hope that Glover would be proud that, in his native city, that pioneering, achieving spirit is alive and well. Aberdeen is a truly globally connected city and the energy hub of Europe. That means that people from around the world come to Aberdeen, while skilled workers from the city travel the globe, particularly in the energy industry.</p><p>I am very pleased that the contribution of Thomas Blake Glover and the importance of Aberdeen's links with Japan have been recognised by Aberdeen City Council in its development of the Japan engagement strategy. Our city is the energy hub of Europe and our local authority has ensured that we capitalise on that strong position by encouraging more international companies&#8212;including companies from Japan&#8212;to bring their business to Aberdeen. Lewis Macdonald rightly mentioned the contribution that Barney Crockett has made to that important work. It is good that we are joined for today&#8217;s debate by Councillor Ross Thomson, John Reynolds, who is the deputy provost, and Councillor Willie Young. That shows the council&#8217;s commitment to the important issues that we are debating.</p><p>The council&#8217;s delegation to Japan has been important in renewing and strengthening the links between Aberdeen and Japan. As Alex Johnstone pointed out, those links are not simply about marking the significance of the historical relationship; they are about building stronger links in the future, too. Fittingly, given Glover&#8217;s multifaceted approach to his life in industry, there are a range of activities in which it is natural for institutions and businesses in Aberdeen to work more closely with their Japanese counterparts. I am referring to renewables, food and drink&#8212;which includes our successful whisky industry&#8212;golf tourism and, of course, the work of our universities. I know that the University of Aberdeen and academic institutions in Japan have already collaborated on research.</p><p>I hope that the new engagement strategy between Aberdeen and Japan will succeed, will be beneficial to both parties and will stimulate investment, research and jobs in Aberdeen and Japan. That will be a fitting legacy for the immense contribution of Thomas Blake Glover and will be supported not only across the chamber and across the council chamber but in Japan and in our great city of Aberdeen.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Aberdeen&#8217;s Engagement Strategy with Japan"}, {"date": "2014-05-27", "body": "<p>During my brief tenure as a member of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee&#8212;perhaps mercifully brief for the other members&#8212;I took part in the latter stages of the inquiry into the delivery of regeneration in Scotland. I am happy to say that I very much enjoyed my short time on the committee and found the inquiry to be not only interesting but important.</p><p>As other members have said, we spend a lot of time in the Parliament talking about what policies should be introduced for communities but somewhat less time on how we can ensure that those who are affected by policy and legislation can play their part in ensuring that it meets their needs. Throughout the inquiry, the emphasis was on listening to groups, communities and individuals to hear their views on regeneration policy and on how they should be involved in shaping the places where they live and the opportunities that they should have in the future. The committee engaged with local people to hear their views and saw the impact&#8212;or, sometimes, lack of impact&#8212;of regeneration policy on the ground.</p><p>I was pleased to take part in the committee&#8217;s visit to Dundee and attend the launch of the report in Aberdeen. It was a refreshing and welcome change to take part in two committee events in the north-east, which may not be entirely unrelated to the weighty north-east contingent on the committee.</p><p>I hope that ministers will pay close attention to the recommendations that the committee made on community engagement as they take forward the community empowerment (Scotland) bill. I am sure that the report will play an important role as we seek to ensure that the bill is best equipped to meet the need of creating more genuinely empowered communities.</p><p>The role, membership and transparency of the CPPs&#8212;which have been referred to a number of times in the debate&#8212;will be an important part of that debate, because it is clear that too many communities feel disempowered and disengaged from the decisions that affect them. Perhaps that is why so few people take part in their community councils, as Mr Mason said. I am sure that, if people felt more empowered and more listened to, they would be more ready to be involved. That is a big challenge not only for community planning partnerships, but for local and national Government.</p><p>The report supports the general thrust of the aims of the community empowerment (Scotland) bill but states that the committee is unclear about how the governance and accountability arrangements for CPPs will work in practice and how the partners will hold one another to account. That will require to be addressed during consideration of the bill. The convener highlighted a number of areas that the committee worked hard on to illustrate in our report and which still require a substantial response from Government. I hope that the committee is successful in obtaining that response and engagement from ministers during the passage of the bill, which we look forward to.</p><p>We heard about the difficulty that local authorities and regeneration companies have had in delivering regeneration strategies and reducing inequality in what is a difficult political and economic environment. We could debate at some length why that environment is so difficult&#8212;earlier, Duncan McNeil highlighted some of the issues that he has seen in this area&#8212;but the key concern for me in the course of the inquiry was to look at what strategies had been put in place, particularly by the regeneration companies, and to examine what had worked and what had not, and from that to explore what lessons should be learned for the future. In that, the inquiry was a very instructive process.</p><p>It was evident that a number of the plans on which URCs had embarked were predicated on economic growth and growth in the housing market that simply did not occur. Of course, it is easy to look back with hindsight, and that experience shows that such plans for regeneration&#8212;whether they are put forward by URCs, councils or others&#8212;must in future be more readily adaptable to changing economic situations.</p><p>It is also fair to say that within the experience of the URCs are examples of best practice that should be encouraged and shared. I welcome the fact that the committee has decided to revisit the work of the URCs towards the end of the year, and I hope that it will see evidence of the URCs taking on board some of the committee&#8217;s valuable conclusions.</p><p>Of course, that was only one aspect of the committee&#8217;s inquiry. As Cameron Buchanan said, one of the impressive things about the report is its scope. It makes recommendations to the Scottish Government on the importance of a wide number of areas, such as implementing the principles of the Christie commission; it makes recommendations to councils on the role of community officers; and it makes practical proposals relating to, for example, the better use of community assets. It also highlights the need for effective use of Scottish Government and European funding streams, which are essential, because there is still a lack of private sector funding for these important initiatives. Further, it deals with the role that must be played not just by Government and councils but by other public sector agencies and housing associations.</p><p>At that point, I depart from the approach of Stewart Stevenson, who takes a rather more laissez-faire approach. The history of community regeneration is laid out in some detail at the beginning of the report, and that history shows that these are not issues that are easy to address or resolve and that there are issues with regard to Government action at every level. It shows that non-intervention is not a recipe for success but that progress on regeneration and community empowerment takes focused efforts over many years by many people&#8212;efforts that can all too easily be derailed. That is why I am pleased that the committee has already indicated its desire to revisit those issues in the future.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, {"date": "2014-05-27", "body": "<p>I do not want to misrepresent Mr Stevenson, so I certainly stand corrected.

Although I was not a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee when it considered the Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Bill, I was, like Murdo Fraser, a member of the Enterprise and Culture Committee in 2005 when it considered the Bankruptcy and Diligence etc (Scotland) Bill. The goal of what was another highly technical piece of legislation was to strike a better balance between the rights of creditors and the rights of debtors and to uphold the can-pay, should-pay principle while helping those who, for whatever reason, genuinely struggled to meet the financial demands of their debts. Such a balance is not always easy to strike and achieving it in this bill has clearly been at the forefront of committee members&#8217; minds.</p><p>In the stage 1 debate, we on this side came to the conclusion that the correct balance had not been struck between those competing demands, particularly with regard to the increase in the debtor contribution payment period from 36 to 48 months. Indeed, that was the subject of amendments 1 and 2 in the name of Jenny Marra, which were debated in this chamber this afternoon. Although the minister has said that the measure is not about full-cost recovery for the Accountant in Bankruptcy, Citizens Advice Scotland and others have expressed the opposite view and voiced concern that the move is not primarily in the interests of debtors, who, after all, do not take lightly the step of entering into such arrangements.</p><p>As a result, I think that it has been right to test the Government&#8217;s stance on this issue, and I agree with Citizens Advice Scotland&#8217;s assessment that even if the provision is intended for individuals who have been assessed as being able to make the contribution, the fact is that increasing the debtor contribution payment period by a further year is very likely to cause them hardship. An additional year of payments, administration fees and charges will not assist them in restoring their financial position, which is, after all, the point of the bankruptcy process.</p><p>However, as colleagues have said, we acknowledge that during stage 2 there was movement from the Scottish Government in a number of important areas, including the raising of the minimal asset process bankruptcy level as well as the offer of &#163;200,000 to support financial education, which will, of course, be welcomed by all parties in the chamber. The provisions on compulsory money advice for bankrupt debtors and financial education for those who it is deemed would benefit from it are ambitions of this legislation that can be supported.</p><p>I believe that my party has a strong track record in improving the laws of this land for people who become unable to meet their financial obligations and who require assistance to restore their financial position while, at the same time, delivering fairness to creditors. Indeed, when we were in government, we achieved those goals through measures such as the debt arrangement scheme and support for money advice. It is always right to review legislation in this area to ensure that it is fit for purpose, and I am sure that ministers have been right to do so in this instance. However, although we welcome a number of provisions in the bill as representing progress in our bankruptcy laws, we maintain strong reservations about the practical impact of other elements.</p><p>I suspect that this will be one of those pieces of legislation for which post-legislative scrutiny will be particularly important; indeed, as Jenny Marra has highlighted, it will be most important with regard to the debtor contribution payment period. It will be necessary to reflect further on this legislation once it has been passed so that we as a Parliament are assured that, in practice, it is delivering a legal framework that effectively provides the balance in the law that I mentioned earlier of maintaining creditors&#8217; rights while assisting those who cannot meet the demands of their debt.</p><p>The bill must be part of that much broader work of Government to help people who are in debt get out of it and, most important, to do whatever we can to ensure that people do not take on unmanageable debt in the first place.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Bill"}, {"date": "2014-03-06", "body": "<p></p><p>1.

I am confident that the substance of my speech and the matters to which I refer will comply with your guidance.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Unite&#8217;s Back Home Safe Campaign"}, {"date": "2014-02-27", "body": "<p>I thank members of all parties who signed the motion in support of Unite&#8217;s back home safe campaign. I also declare an interest: I am a member of Unite the union. I am pleased that a number of my fellow union members, who are offshore reps, have joined us from Aberdeen for the debate. Their commitment to the campaign is reflected in the fact that they bring to the Parliament a petition that has more than 3,000 signatures, which backs the measures that the union is promoting to restore the confidence of the workforce in helicopter safety.</p><p>Workforce confidence was shattered after the tragic crash off Sumburgh, in which four people lost their lives&#8212;the fifth ditching of a Super Puma helicopter in just four years. Of course, the first of those events was the tragedy that took place in 2009, which all of us remember all too well, when 16 people lost their lives.</p><p>In that context, it can be no surprise that in a Unite survey of its offshore members, more than 53 per cent of workers said that they did not have confidence in offshore helicopter safety and 77 per cent said that their confidence in helicopter safety had decreased in the past 12 months.</p><p>Helicopter transport is vital to our oil and gas industry, which we all know is of great importance to the Scottish economy. The key goal for all of us&#8212;ministers, parliamentarians, trade unions, regulators and of course the industry&#8212;must be to restore confidence in helicopter safety and ensure that the safety record is greatly improved.</p><p>That has driven the important and successful campaign by Unite, which has produced clear proposals for action to improve safety. Those include increased investment to create a larger offshore fleet, changes to the internal seat configuration on offshore helicopters, changes to the design of helicopters that are used for passenger transfer and improved survival equipment and training for workers.</p><p>Last week, the Civil Aviation Authority published the report of its review following the crash in August. Although it is far from a final word on the issue, it has been welcomed as a step forward, and it is a mark of the success that Unite has had in making its case for safety improvements. The review, in identifying the need for new prohibitions on flying conditions, changes to onboard seating configurations and the improvement of emergency breathing equipment for workers, proposes measures that Unite has called for as part of the back home safe campaign. The review points the way to a change of culture, from competition to collaboration, which is to be welcomed.</p><p>That is not to say that there has been no collaboration up to now. The helicopter safety steering group, which includes in its membership John Taylor of Unite and Jake Molloy of RMT, has been an important forum. It is also true that the industry&#8217;s Step Change in Safety organisation, which is focused on improving safety, has done a huge amount of work. However, further measures and more joint working are clearly needed, and the review recommends that operators adopt a set of best practice standard procedures. It also found:</p><p>&#8220;All the helicopter operators reported that customer influence in operational matters was too extensive. The perception that contracts are offered at too short a timescale and awarded on lowest cost is also prevalent.&#8221;</p><p>The industry must respond to that finding, because the priority has to be safety, rather than getting the lowest-cost contract.</p><p>The review is therefore welcome, but it does not diminish the requirement for a full independent commission of inquiry into helicopter safety. The call for such an inquiry has been led at Westminster by my colleague Frank Doran MP. That call is backed by the unions and, in the members&#8217; business debate that I led on the issue last year, the case for such an inquiry was most persuasively made by Tavish Scott.</p><p>The CAA review does not answer all the fundamental questions that the series of accidents has posed. In particular, there is not enough scrutiny of the work of regulators, who over the years have been reactive rather than proactive. Indeed, to be fair to the CAA, chapter 7 of the report that it published last week identifies problems in the review process. I therefore hope that ministers will agree that there is a need for an independent inquiry and will support the proposal.</p><p>The final point that I want to raise is on an issue that is clearly the responsibility of the Scottish ministers. It relates not to the substance of any particular fatal accident inquiry but to the timing of inquiries. If our fatal accident inquiry process as a whole worked properly, we might be having a very different debate today, but it does not. It took five years for the inquiry into the 2009 crash to be held. I do not believe that anyone in the chamber wants those who lost loved ones last year to face such a long wait. That is why I again urge ministers to support Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s proposal for a member&#8217;s bill to speed up the FAI process.</p><p>The Unite Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, has said:</p><p>&#8220;Five ditchings and 20 deaths since 2009 is an unacceptable failing of health and safety and collectively we have an obligation to ensure we tackle this serious problem, taking every step possible to help offshore workers get back home safe in the future.&#8221;</p><p>Those words get to the heart of the debate. Today, the prosperity of our country is founded on the labours of our offshore workers, who have to carry out their jobs in harsh environments. We owe it to them and to their families to ensure that they get back home safe, which is why I hope that members will support this important campaign.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Unite&#8217;s Back Home Safe Campaign"}, {"date": "2014-02-26", "body": "<p></p><p>4.

I am clear, as are the other Labour members, that increasing opportunities for women is best achieved in this Scottish Parliament within the United Kingdom. The cabinet secretary talked about the Equal Pay Act 1970. I will take the opportunity to talk a bit about the Labour minister Barbara Castle and her role in fighting for the rights of women across the UK. She was the crusader for women&#8217;s rights and opportunities in the 1960s who broke the glass ceiling not just for women in politics but for women in society more widely. She fought for the cause of equal rights for men and women.</p><p>A crusade was led by women across the UK&#8212;including many unrecognised working-class women&#8212;that resulted in the equal pay act, which was introduced by Castle. The act began life not in the House of Commons, not in a Parliament building, but in an industrial dispute in Dagenham in Essex. Most of us know the story of the female car seat machinists at the Ford plant in Dagenham who took their industrial action to Downing Street to get their work recognised as skilled and equal to the work of their male counterparts. That created the impetus that led to the equal pay legal obligation that the cabinet secretary talked about&#8212;the obligation to pay both men and women the same.</p><p>However, those women in Essex were not solely concerned about their own rights in that Ford factory. They were motivated by the idea of securing rights for women across Britain, just as the suffragettes had been years before them. Across Britain&#8212;across Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland&#8212;they led that progressive movement for equal pay. Those progressive movements and the trade union movement have always joined hands and forces with their brothers and sisters in the towns and cities of Scotland and across England, Wales and Northern Ireland because their aim has always been to tear down barriers and not to erect borders.</p><p>The United Kingdom is an economic union with a deeply integrated economy in which goods and services are traded, and being part of the large and diverse UK economy provides strength and stability to Scotland&#8217;s finances, as we know from all the economic analysis over the past year. It also offers Scotland protection from unexpected economic and financial shocks, which we have seen in our own lifetimes, for both men and women.</p><p>The rest of the UK is Scotland&#8217;s biggest trading partner and at the core of the argument for economic union is the opportunity and security that it provides to women, families and businesses across this country. I do not believe that it is in Scotland&#8217;s interests for the economic union to be torn apart. In the long term, an independent Scotland could not remain part of an integrated UK economy. The economic union means that we share a currency and can pool our taxes and spending in fiscal union, which ultimately benefits women.</p><p>That fiscal integration in turn necessitates and sustains a sense of social solidarity and provides security to Scotland&#8217;s women through the sharing of risks, rewards and resources on the basis of need rather than on the basis of nationality, which the Scottish National Party posits.</p><p>It is convenient but not honest for the SNP to ignore the fact that it was a UK Labour Government, working with a Labour-led Administration in this Parliament, that made substantial inroads into expanding opportunities for women, by making work pay through the minimum wage, which SNP members were not present to vote for, and by instigating tax credits.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>The act was an ambitious piece of legislation, which has made great inroads in equalising pay between men and women.

I first worked with Sir Ian when I was vice-chair of the Government oil and gas industry forum PILOT a decade ago, when he chaired the industry leadership team. Even at that time, his clear focus was on what more could be done to maximise the recovery of oil and gas from the North Sea.</p><p>Sir Ian Wood is happy to work with Governments of any party, as ministers well know. When he says that he cannot stand idly by while his words are misquoted in the referendum debate, we should all pay attention to what he actually says. Sir Ian Wood has never said that there are 24 billion barrels of oil equivalent waiting to be extracted from the UK continental shelf. His report says that there may be as little as 12 billion barrels, or as much as 24 billion barrels, but nothing is certain other than the scale of challenges to be overcome along the way.</p><p>Sir Ian Wood believes that, if Government implements all his recommendations for taxes, licensing and regulation and if the industry gets back to carrying out new exploration&#8212;it has largely ceased to do that&#8212;and finds a lot more oil and gas in future years, it might be able to produce between 15 billion and 16.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent over the next 40 years.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>Not at the moment.</p><p>If that is done, future revenues for Government might come in at around &#163;5 billion a year, as they did last year. That is &#163;2 billion a year less than the Scottish National Party predicted, or a shortfall of around &#163;370 a year for every man, woman and child living in Scotland.</p><p>Even more important than the numbers is what Sir Ian Wood has said about the impact of independence on that vital industry. Costs in the North Sea rose by 15 per cent last year and exploration in UK waters is at an all-time low. Stability and certainty going forward are critical to maximising economic recovery. In Sir Ian Wood&#8217;s view, a yes vote in the referendum</p><p>&#8220;would inevitably cause a significant loss of momentum over the next three or four years&#8212;a critical development period in maximising recovery of our reserves.&#8221;</p><p>None of the optimistic projections that he or anybody else has made will be realised unless we secure that certainty. That is why he chose to highlight the risks of a vote for Scottish independence.</p><p>A yes vote would not bring certainty and stability to the North Sea. Instead of a single fiscal, licensing and regulatory regime across the UK continental shelf, we would have one regime in Scottish waters and a different regime in the rest of the UK. That clearly has implications for employment in the sector, not least in Aberdeen, from where many companies operate their entire UK assets. It also means that much time and many millions of pounds would be spent disaggregating the assets and liabilities of companies that operate across the UK continental shelf, although that time urgently needs to be spent on creating a new approach to maximising recovery in the future.</p><p>It makes more sense for the offshore industry in Britain to stay together, and the same applies across the economy. The United Kingdom provides Scottish business with a home market of more than 60 million people. That would no longer be true in the event of independence.</p><p>The other day, I received a letter from Richard Lochhead, who wanted to talk to me about access to that home market for Aberdeenshire farmers.

Of course, there are other member states of NATO that do not have nuclear weapons on their territory. By definition, however, no member state of NATO rejects the deployment of nuclear weapons as a component of NATO's collective defence. The strategic concept is the agreed policy of all members of the North Atlantic Council and is by definition supported by every NATO member state.</p><p>As a result, the then members of the SNP who said in 2012 that those who voted to join NATO would not get rid of Trident were absolutely right&#8212;and they are right in that respect to this day. NATO strategy is to retain and deploy nuclear weapons; the UK is one of three nuclear-armed NATO members; and Scotland is where the UK&#8217;s nuclear weapons are currently deployed. As a result, an independent Scotland whose first strategic priority was to remove those weapons would clearly be opposing the policy not just of the UK but of NATO as a whole.

The Westminster Government has made it clear that welfare has a role in economic recovery, and it is no coincidence that in this country&#8212;the UK as a whole&#8212;the proportion of workless households is the lowest ever recorded, the number and proportion of children in those households is at a record low, the number of children in households in which no one has ever worked is at its lowest level for 15 years, and the inactivity rate of 21.7 per cent has never been lower, reflecting the falling number of people who are claiming inactivity benefits. Employment is up in every UK region. Since the election, three quarters of those who are in employment are working full time. In the 16 to 24 age group, the number of those who are not in employment, education or training is at its lowest level for more than eight years.</p><p>Often when we talk about those numbers, the Government in Scotland likes to claim responsibility for them, but it cannot claim that responsibility if it pursues a negative policy in relation to our welfare reforms. The key welfare reform that was raised in the press release that came out this morning is the change in disability benefits. In that press release, the Government makes it clear that</p><p>&#8220;More than 100,000 Scots are expected to lose some, or all, of their UK disability benefits by 2018, with individuals set to lose at least &#163;1,120 per year&#8221;.</p><p>We have to look slightly more closely at those figures. If 100,000 of the 190,000 Scots who are in receipt of disability benefit are likely to lose out, it is reasonable to expect that personal independent payments will benefit the 90,000 Scots who are most severely disabled. That is the key change that moving from DLA to PIP is designed to satisfy. It is a desire to ensure that those who are in greatest need benefit from the resource that is available.</p><p>The figure of 100,000 who will see their support reduced includes a significant proportion who, as a part of the change, will move from disability payments to universal credit. Of course, the Scottish Government does not account for that reduction in the total budget so it, consequently, skews the figures.</p><p>The impression is being given that the amount of money that is being paid in disability benefits is somehow reducing. However, the figures that are available through the Department for Work and Pensions&#8212;I am sure that someone will be willing to dispute them&#8212;appear to tell a different story. The real-terms budget for the current financial year is a record high. The money that is being paid in DLA will begin to tail off as we reach the end of this decade and PIP begins to kick in. In fact, it is not until the later years of this decade that the amount of money that is being paid in disability allowances and benefits will begin to fall below the record high that we will see in the current year.</p><p>However, at the same time, the take-up of universal credit will plug that gap and ensure that nobody loses out. The key issue is that we ensure that, as we move forward into economic recovery, we provide opportunities for the many people who wish to work but have not had the opportunity to get back in to the workforce. Unless we can deliver a viable healthy workforce in this country, we will not benefit from the on-going recovery.</p><p>I turn finally to the discussion that took place yesterday at the Welfare Reform Committee, which has already been mentioned by Jackie Baillie.

However, in spite of the fact that he gave a good description, he failed to go right back to the start of nuclear weapons. History tells us that back in the 1940s, it became clear that a fascist regime that was waging unconditional war across Europe was developing nuclear weapons and the means by which to deliver them using missiles. The Governments of the allied nations at that time decided to come together to work on a single project to develop a nuclear weapon that would act as a counter threat to any nuclear weapon with which we were threatened.</p><p>The Manhattan project brought together the best brains that were available to us in the United States and here in Britain and, ironically, many Jewish exiles from the countries that were occupied by the fascist regime.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>By the time the Manhattan project had succeeded in creating that weapon, the war in Europe was over.

However, unlike Patrick Harvie, I do not have the benefit of 20:20 hindsight, and the people who made those decisions made them for reasons that were available to them at the time.</p><p>Before we leave history, it should also be noted that many people in the United States and the United Kingdom were convicted of treason for deliberately leaking the secrets of those weapons to the Soviet Union and other countries, believing that they were doing so to create the balance that we have talked about today as having kept the peace for many generations.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>No, I will not give way.

Yes, nuclear weapons brought about the cold war and kept the peace, but they did not keep the peace in conventional terms. That is why we should always be concerned to ensure that, as we go forward, we understand what nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are about. This country has done a great deal to encourage and develop non-proliferation. Sadly, the number of nations that have acquired nuclear weapons in recent years has increased. However, this country has done its bit to ensure that they did not find that technology here.</p><p>However, nuclear disarmament is something that people understand in different ways. There are those who argue for unilateral nuclear disarmament. I will never argue for that, because I believe that unilateral nuclear disarmament, especially in a country that has done its bit to keep the peace, will not deliver our objective in the long term. In the distant past, the strategic arms limitation talks succeeded in vastly reducing the number of weapons that were being held by the major protagonists in the cold war. What we need to do now is to ensure that that multilateral approach continues.</p><p>Here in Scotland, we have to understand what the right position to take is. Those within the Scottish National Party and certain others&#8212;but not all&#8212;who support the yes campaign have made the mistake of believing that the presence and renewal of Trident are subjects on which they can gain some political credence. I believe that they are wrong. I believe that information contained within recent opinion surveys demonstrates that the people of Scotland have a far more substantial understanding of what nuclear weapons are about and how we would best dispose of them than do those who have spoken from the Government party&#8217;s back benches today.</p><p>The truth is that the loss of Trident would cost Scotland jobs and it would cost Scotland credibility in the longer term. What would we get from that? The money that would be saved in an independent Scotland&#8217;s budget by not having to fund the replacement of Trident would not achieve the objectives that Trident&#8217;s opponents have set out. As members have described, Angus Robertson says that it will all go into the military budget. Annabelle Ewing regularly says that it will plug the gap on welfare, in spite of the fact that, if we add it up, it does not come to a quarter of what would be required. It has been spent on youth employment, education, colleges&#8212;you name it, they will spend it. That, unfortunately, is a cynical ploy of a desperate campaign running out of steam.

The effect would be to remove from the bill the attempt to end the right to buy.</p><p>The right to buy council houses has been the greatest driver for social change in Scotland in 50 years. It has created strong mixed-tenure communities that to this day remain examples of how we can do that within many of our towns and cities across Scotland. It has driven the aspiration to home ownership and has been a positive thing in many areas.</p><p>The pressure to end the right to buy has existed in Scotland for some time and has been manifest within Parliament. However, the notion that we should somehow protect social housing has not been consistent through the discussions that have taken place. Indeed, the notion of social housing was, in effect, created by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001. As a consequence, it is only since then that we have been able to divide social housing from rented housing or other forms of tenure.</p><p>I deny that the so-called loss of social housing is really happening. Of the 1,400 houses that were sold during the last full year for which information is available, only 347 were sold under the modernised right to buy. However, 1,173 houses were sold under the pre-2001 preserved right to buy to people who had been tenants in their properties for more than 12 years&#8212;many for significantly longer than that. I maintain that those who exercised their right to buy were long-term tenants who, had they not decided to buy, would have remained long-term tenants. Houses will not be freed up by removing their right to buy. In fact, the suggestion is that, in the first year, as few as 30 houses might be freed for new tenancies as a result of the proposed change.</p><p>Let us contrast that with the effect of the bill and its move to end the right to buy. Provisions in the bill will give a two-year period in which people who are entitled to exercise their right to buy will be able to make up their minds whether to exercise that right. I presume that, in an independent Scotland, rights will not be removed instantaneously from our people without compensation, so I presume that the opportunity to exercise an existing right will be maintained.</p><p>The effect of the attempt to remove the right to buy will, I believe, be a feeding frenzy in which the Government might lose rather more houses than it expects to save. I believe that it is a mistake to move forward with the abolition of the right to buy at this time, and I believe that doing so will prove to be counterproductive, by the Government&#8217;s own criteria.</p><p>I move amendment 38.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>I will press amendment 38.

The measure was removed by the minister at stage 2, following a campaign that argued that it could lead to widespread discrimination against younger people. I believe that the campaign was based on scaremongering and I am aware of no evidence to support the claims about discrimination. The minister argued that age in itself is not an indicator of housing need, but the five organisations that have given me input have never claimed otherwise. The case is based on the argument that, in considering how best to make a particular allocation to someone in significant housing need, it should be possible to consider age as a secondary factor where lifestyle or related issues need to be taken into account in order for a sensible, sustainable let to be made. I believe that the section should be reintroduced to the bill, and that would be the effect of my amendment.</p><p>On the other amendments in the group, I support John Lamont&#8217;s ideas and have significant experience from my mailbag of the difficulties in certain rural areas, with local people finding it impossible to find a house locally.

I am delighted to take part in the debate and make no apology for devoting my speaking time to celebrating another important Scottish festival that is very close to my heart&#8212;the Aberdeen international youth festival, or AIYF as it is known, of which I have been a trustee and friend for a considerable number of years. In connection with that, I refer members to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests.</p><p>The AIYF has just finished its 42nd successful season and is now recognised as one of the best celebrations of youth arts that is held anywhere in the world today. It has had Government backing in recent years, with successive ministers, including Patricia Ferguson and the current culture secretary, Fiona Hyslop, attending its opening ceremony. Unfortunately, Ms Hyslop was unable to be in Aberdeen this year because of her Commonwealth games commitments, but AIYF is very appreciative of her on-going support.</p><p>The festival was created in the late 1960s by the late Blyth Major, the music director of the midland youth orchestra, and the late Lionel Bryer, the chairman of the International Youth Foundation. They conceived the idea of bringing together youth orchestras from all over the world, using music as a unifying bond to promote international understanding. The first festival of youth orchestras was held in 1969 in St Moritz, in Switzerland.</p><p>Invited by the British Tourist Authority, the festival moved to the UK and established bases in both London and Aberdeen for the following five years, during which the festival was able to expand to incorporate all forms of dancing, jazz and choral music thanks to the excellent facilities and local support in the city of Aberdeen. Such was the support within the city&#8212;from the council, the university, local businesses and great audiences&#8212;that the decision was made to focus the event entirely in Aberdeen and the north-east, and in 1980 the name was changed to the AIYF, as we know it today. The festival now embraces dance, theatre, world music&#8212;both traditional and modern&#8212;choirs, orchestras, opera and jazz. This year, we even had a large Chinese marching band from Beijing.</p><p>In recent years, audience numbers have increased steadily, and the AIYF has continued to expand its educational and community projects. It is able to select the most talented individuals and groups from all over the world, giving them a platform on which to show their talents in a celebration of youth culture that is recognised universally as one of the best in the world. The festival is held in high regard by Aberdonians, and the extended festival performances in towns and villages in Aberdeenshire are enjoyed by capacity audiences wherever they take place.</p><p>The AIYF lives up to its founding principle of using music and other art forms to promote international understanding, which is so important in the divided and strife-ridden world that we inhabit today. At this year&#8217;s opening ceremony on 27 July, when the participants&#8217; national flags were paraded into the music hall to the accompaniment of the national anthems, it was moving to see young attendees from the Ukraine, the Netherlands, Russia, Azerbaijan, the Czech Republic, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United States of America, Mexico, China, Japan, Scotland and England all applauding one another&#8217;s anthems, and the saltire and the union flag, with everyone standing for the British national anthem. Their faces were a picture, as always, when the renowned Bucksburn and district junior pipe band entered the hall to conclude proceedings. I know that the current and previous ministers have experienced that.</p><p>The ensuing week of performances within and beyond the city brought a colour and atmosphere to Aberdeen that we see only when the AIYF is in town. This year, we were blessed with the same wonderful sunshine that was enjoyed at the Commonwealth games&#8212;except when we entertained the American schools orchestra from New York to a pre-performance barbecue at Braemar castle, when it simply poured with rain. It was hard to believe that the talented performers in evening dress who entertained us to Beethoven&#8217;s eighth symphony just an hour later had been dripping wet in the type of Scottish weather that they had previously just heard talked about. Perhaps my sherry trifle had something to do with their good humour&#8212;certainly, their conductor appreciated it.</p><p>To see choirs and orchestras performing magnificently together after the scantiest rehearsal time is quite humbling, and I know that that experience was repeated across many different venues where audiences were delighted by dance, theatre and international music.</p><p>The performers are catered for in the university&#8217;s halls of residence and, every evening, the young people who have not been performing that day provide an impromptu concert for the others and have a great time socially. In that way, over many years, friendships have been made across language and political divides&#8212;a number of visiting groups are now brought to Aberdeen by directors and leaders who first came to the festival as teenagers.</p><p>One group that has come to Aberdeen for many festivals since 1977 is the Saiga ballet company from Tokyo. This year, it was accompanied once again by its founder and choreographer, fondly known to us as Toshi, now a fit and sprightly 82-year-old who, I am told, still dances. Toshi is an honorary friend of the AIYF and is an enormous fan of Aberdeen. Of course, we were delighted to see her back again.</p><p>I was particularly pleased on Tuesday this week to attend the event in the Parliament that was sponsored by Christian Allard to showcase the North East Folk Collective, who also performed at this year&#8217;s AIYF. The group was formed in 2009 by Sharon Hassan, a local fiddler from Inch in Aberdeenshire, and plays traditional music from the north-east and other parts of the world. There were 22 members of the band with us on Tuesday, and we all had our toes tapping to their talented performances. I was delighted to hear from Sharon that a large number of even younger children are coming up through the ranks of her group, safeguarding the future of traditional music for many years to come.</p><p>I could go on all afternoon, but suffice it to say that the AIYF is going strong and that its current director and chief executive officer, Stewart Aitken, is doing a splendid job of leading it, despite limited staff resources and a budget that is ever tighter, as is the case with most cultural festivals. The core funding from the city council and the University of Aberdeen and the financial support of many sponsors who are too numerous to mention individually but who are led by the oil majors, BP and Shell, are absolutely essential. That money has to be vigorously pursued every year.</p><p>There are on-going discussions about the future governance and development of the AIYF, but I have no doubt that there is a will to ensure its future for many more years to come, and plans are in hand for that.</p><p>Time precludes me from saying more, but I can assure members of a warm reception and an exciting cultural experience if they come to Aberdeen between 24 July and 1 August next year.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-08-14", "body": "<p>I agree that the peripheral AIYF is appreciated&#8212;I mentioned Aberdeenshire and clearly it also goes into Angus.

Therefore, I regard the debate as a learning curve and, in that respect, I join others in thanking Bill Kidd for bringing the matter to the chamber.</p><p>Having looked at the dearest Scotland website, I was intrigued to see that the campaign was started by three ladies from Glasgow who were inspired to look at our future as a nation and to invite individuals from all backgrounds and ages to contribute to their hopes for Scotland in the years ahead.</p><p>As dearest Scotland is an apolitical initiative, and as members&#8217; business debates tend to be non-partisan, I will steer clear of mentioning next month&#8217;s vote.

Who knows, perhaps he may one day follow his granny&#8217;s footsteps and come to this place, and his first mention in the Official Report may not be his last.</p><p>Our children and grandchildren increasingly face an uncertain future. Every day we see war and conflict around the world, with Scotland playing a key role in contributing to help with those global problems. Therefore, my hopes, wishes and aspirations for Scotland do not sit in isolation; indeed, my dreams and aspirations as a Scot may also be a vital component in the hopes and wishes of all humankind on this planet of ours&#8212;a hope that one day we might all live together as brothers and sisters in a global family that inhabits planet earth.</p><p>As human beings, we have hopes and dreams at all levels; as an Aberdonian, I have dreams for the future of my city.

It is often said that people choose to live on the streets, but I dispute that. I aspire to a Scotland where people achieve their personal potential, where they have a permanent roof over their heads, where they are not cold and hungry and where they do not feel worthless. It is my genuine belief that we should, wherever possible, take responsibility for our own wellbeing and be self-reliant, but we should also reach out to help people who are not able to achieve that and who do not have a support network of family and friends around who could help them. Life can be very difficult and complex for many vulnerable people and they deserve our help and support.</p><p>The dearest Scotland campaign crosses the political divide, giving all Scots an opportunity to express their visions for a future Scotland. If I was a cynic, I would regard this as an airy-fairy exercise but, thankfully, I am not and, having read some of the letters posted on the campaign website, it is clear to me that there are many issues of common concern, from protecting our environment to solving the on-going scourge of drugs in our society.</p><p>I understand that the dearest Scotland campaign intends to collate responses from the public by the end of the year, with a view to exhibiting them early next year.

That is a good thing.</p><p>There have been issues with primary care throughout my 11 years in the Parliament. A decade ago, I was happy to support the 2004 GP contract, which removed from GPs their 24/7 responsibility for patients, because it was also very difficult at that time to recruit and retain younger doctors, growing numbers of whom were unwilling to accept the round-the-clock commitment of their predecessors.</p><p>During the ensuing years, there have been significant concerns about out-of-hours care provision, particularly in some of the more remote parts of Scotland.

The primary care medical workforce has become increasingly part time, partly because of the predominance of female doctors who want a work-life balance that fits with their parenting role, but also because of an increasing number of men who combine general practice with other part-time appointments, such as teaching or hospital work.</p><p>In the meantime, patient demand has escalated, lists are bigger and the demographic change means that more patients are living longer with comorbidities and more complex medical conditions. All that is happening at a time of financial stringency, when spending has to be carefully planned and controlled.</p><p>The NHS in Scotland has benefited from the UK Government&#8217;s decision to protect the NHS budget and from the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to ring fence the ensuing Barnett consequentials for the Scottish health budget. My party has not agreed with all the Scottish Government&#8217;s policy decisions on how to spend that money&#8212;for example, we disagree with free prescriptions for higher rate taxpayers who can afford to pay&#8212;but we have campaigned for more investment in primary care through the restoration of a universal GP-attached health visitor service. We therefore very much welcome last week&#8217;s announcement of 500 new health visitor posts, which will provide significant support to GPs, particularly in the more deprived parts of the country. Likewise, we were pleased with the recent changes to the Scottish contract, which removed some of the bureaucratic box ticking and allowed GPs to have a bit more face-to-face contact with their patients.</p><p>However, in the face of growing pressures on the service, the Government&#8217;s 2020 vision for more care to be provided in the community and the integration of health and social care&#8212;a policy that will require GPs to be at the heart of the primary care team if it is to be successful&#8212;a good, hard look needs to be taken at how services will be provided in the future, with the Scottish community involved at the heart of the debate.</p><p>I endorse the BMA&#8217;s concern about the need for fit-for-purpose primary care premises. In the north-east, we have seen a few excellent developments recently, such as the Calsayseat and Woodside health centres in Aberdeen, and we look forward to the approved new health centre in Inverurie. However, there are concerns in my area&#8212;as Alison McInnes has rightly pointed out&#8212;with rapidly growing populations throughout Aberdeenshire and new settlements being built, for example around Portlethen, without provision of the primary care facilities that will be needed by the increased population. There is also a need to replace buildings such as the Foresterhill health centre in Aberdeen, where my husband used to work, which was state of the art when it opened in 1979 but is now well past its sell-by date.</p><p>The motion raises some serious issues that cannot be dealt with adequately in such a short debate but which merit much fuller discussion in the chamber. I hope that the minister will pay heed to that.</p><p>Once again, I commend Alison McInnes for drawing the BMA&#8217;s campaign to our attention.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Your GP Cares Campaign"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>Does the minister accept that there is a time lag between the developments that we are currently faced with and the projected medical facilities, because they will arrive some years down the line?

[Applause.]</p><p>I have no doubt, however, that he is relieved that the role was a temporary one, because not all cared for people are easy to please, and I will leave members to guess where I stand on that one.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate is right to acknowledge the very significant contribution that older people make to our society as paid employees, entrepreneurs, taxpayers and consumers, and as volunteers and carers, which is particularly appropriate at the start of carers week. I was therefore a little disappointed, although I suppose not really surprised, as the referendum debate drags on, to read the sting in the tail of the Government&#8217;s motion, questioning the need that has been identified by the UK Government to increase the pensionable age in future.</p><p>Of course, Scottish Conservatives continue to support free personal care, as we have done since the outset, and we want to see the concessionary travel scheme continued and extended to include community transport because the present situation is unfair to many pensioners who cannot benefit from free travel because they do not have access to standard bus services. We also agree that carers should be financially and otherwise supported in their very valuable role, and welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to increase the carer&#8217;s allowance, as we state in our amendment. However, if all that is to be possible and sustainable into the future in the face of a burgeoning elderly population, any sensible Government must plan ahead for its funding, and that is why changes to the pensionable age will be required. The UK Government is quite right to take that on board. That Government, as we heard in last week&#8217;s Queen&#8217;s speech, is also committed to introducing a private pensions bill and a pensions tax bill to help the pensioners of the future in planning for their old age. Most people realise that there really is no such thing as a free lunch and simply do not buy into the SNP&#8217;s myriad uncosted promises.</p><p>We will support the Liberal Democrat amendment, but we cannot support Labour&#8217;s amendment, simply because of its call for a review of the NHS in Scotland, which we have already opposed.</p><p>I now turn to the celebratory part of the debate, and acknowledge the immense contribution that older people make to Scottish society. The Royal Voluntary Service has estimated that the economic contribution of over-65s in 2010 was worth &#163;40 billion, and that that will rise to &#163;77 billion by 2030; an enormous sum in anybody&#8217;s book. Employers are increasingly recognising the value of older workers and encouraging their employment, to the extent that Age Scotland has this year created an employer of the year category in its annual awards scheme.</p><p>Many professional people continue to play a valuable role after their retirement. In the NHS, for instance, particularly in general practice, retired doctors working as locums plug many staffing gaps, covering for holidays or allowing GPs time off for training or professional meetings. That benefits the NHS and allows the doctors to continue the medical work for which they were trained without the burden of administration that besets so many senior GPs in the modern world. My colleagues who have locum experience all say how enjoyable it has been.</p><p>We are all familiar with the contribution that is still being made in the field of bacteriology by Professor Hugh Pennington, using his knowledge and experience in the battle against campylobacter and E coli 0157. Just the other evening, I learned that Professor John Mallard, the inventor of the magnetic resonance imaging scanner went on after retirement to develop the positron emission tomography, or PET, scanner that is so widely used today. I was also delighted to learn that John&#8217;s prototype MRI scanner is to be preserved and displayed permanently within Aberdeen royal infirmary, which is a fitting tribute to a man whose immense contribution to society worldwide has never had the public recognition that it deserves.</p><p>Volunteers are essential to our society and older people are widely recognised as some of the most active local volunteers, as good neighbours or active residents. The 2008-09 citizenship survey found that a third of people aged 60 to 74 and a fifth of those aged 75 and over undertake some formal volunteering in their community. That led me to think about my contemporaries in my local area in Aberdeen. My next-door neighbour joined the children&#8217;s panel when he retired from the oil industry, and a close friend continues her long involvement with Citizens Advice Scotland. Other neighbours run our local neighbourhood watch schemes or play an active role as community councillors, and others produce and deliver our regular community newsletter. A group of older people run our annual community festival.</p><p>Cancer patients rely on the support of volunteers who work as Friends of Roxburghe House or with Cancer Link Aberdeen &amp; North&#8212;CLAN&#8212;a well-known and active local cancer charity. Many of my age group do regular fundraising for those and other charities, such as Marie Curie Cancer Care, Friends of Anchor or the Maggie&#8217;s centre, not to mention Guide Dogs, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Cyrenians and many other organisations. Hospital patients and housebound people have come to rely on the RVS for the provision of refreshments in wards and clinics and the social contact that is provided by volunteers, many of them retired, who deliver meals on wheels to people who rarely have visitors from the outside world.</p><p>I have given just a few examples of the extent of volunteering in my area, so just think of the contribution of volunteers to Scottish society as a whole when such activities are multiplied across all our local communities. If we add to that the enormous contribution that grandparents make to childcare in Scotland and the number of older people who willingly and lovingly care for their partners, friends or neighbours, we will realise just how much we rely on older people to support the fabric of our communities and how much resource they save the public purse. We should not regard the elderly as a burden; rather, we should celebrate their role in contributing to a cohesive and caring Scottish society.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-10257.2, to leave out from &#8220;and believes&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;; understands that changes to the pension age are required as a result of the aging population; commends the UK Government&#8217;s commitment to introducing a Private Pensions Bill, to allow employees to contribute to &#8220;collective pension&#8221; funds, and a Pensions Tax Bill, to give those who have saved discretion over the use of their retirement funds; believes that a solution must be found to the issue of community transport being excluded from a concessionary travel scheme; welcomes the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to increase the carer&#8217;s allowance, and urges the Scottish Government to address the underlying social issues that lead to such poor life expectancy rates in some parts of Scotland.&#8221;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Older People"}, {"date": "2014-04-02", "body": "<p>I welcome the Liberal Democrats&#8217; decision to debate Scotland&#8217;s mental health, although it is perhaps a little premature, given that the 10 year follow-up to the Grant report of 2003 is due to be published later this year.</p><p>However, given that one in four of us will experience a mental health problem at some time in our lives, and that mental ill health now accounts for close to half of all people who are not working because of health problems, it is important that we consider what progress is being made to tackle the unmet needs of those who are affected by mental illness.</p><p>There is no doubt that significant efforts are being made to speed up diagnosis and referral of people who experience mental health problems, and to provide the appropriate services to aid their recovery. The HEAT target that has been set by the Government to have a maximum waiting time, by the end of this year, of 18 weeks from referral to accessing psychological treatment, is very welcome, but is some way from being achieved, with just 82 per cent of adults and 85 per cent of children currently being seen within 18 weeks. Those waiting times do not sound very long, but 4 and a half months is quite a long time for people to be suffering mental trauma without access to the services that they need. I therefore hope that the target times, once they are achieved, will be re-set at a more ambitious level.</p><p>SAMH has expressed concern about the health inequalities that persist in parts of Scotland and within certain communities, with access to services being affected by geography, deprivation and ethnicity. SAMH found that in the more deprived areas more than a quarter of people did not know where to seek help when they suffered from depression, anxiety or other mental health problems, and that of those who did seek help, 77 per cent went initially to their general practitioner.</p><p>That certainly ties in with what the Health and Sport Committee heard yesterday from GPs who work in deprived communities, who said that many of their patients suffer from multiple comorbidities, and that mental health issues are closely associated with the physical ill health and social problems that affect many people in those areas. Those GPs are under severe and increasing pressure in dealing with their workload, and find that they do not have adequate time to spend with their patients. In those communities there are many people from ethnic minority backgrounds, who also have cultural barriers to seeking help.</p><p>Moreover, a recent survey of GPs by SAMH showed that GPs often do not make referrals to services including psychological therapies and social prescribing, because waiting times are too long, referral criteria are unclear, or there is no access to such services in their area. The resultant delays in supporting people who experience mental health problems mean that by the time people come to treatment, their situation is likely to be more complicated and their recovery may be compromised.</p><p>Similar delays in engaging with psychiatric services are quite common in remote and rural areas, and for farmers in particular, who used to have the support of colleagues and family on the farm, but who now lead fairly isolated lives and bottle up their problems. That has led to a significant increase in suicide among farmers in recent years, which is cause for concern. However, it is encouraging that overall rates of suicide have come down, but we cannot be complacent about that.</p><p>Two commitments in the Government&#8217;s mental health strategy particularly interest me. Commitment 21 is:</p><p>&#8220;We will identify particular challenges and opportunities linked to the mental health of older people and will develop outcome measures related to older people&#8217;s mental health as part of the work to take forward the integration process.&#8221;</p><p>Commitment 22 is:</p><p>&#8220;We will work with the Royal College of GPs and other partners to increase the number of people with long term conditions with a co-morbidity of depression or anxiety who are receiving appropriate care and treatment for their mental illness.&#8221;</p><p>Both groups of people are increasing in number as the population of Scotland ages, and the first will certainly contribute to a rise in psychological problems associated with dementia. Given that, I ask the minister to give us an update on those two commitments.</p><p>Finally, I want to touch on a success story for children and young people in Fife who have severe mental health conditions. The Royal College of Nursing brought it to my attention just this morning, and I suspect that the minister might have been talking about the same thing in his speech. The NHS Fife child and adolescent mental health intensive therapy service, which is run as a partnership involving nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists, provides personalised community-focused care for eight-year-olds to 18-year-olds. Under the leadership of a nurse consultant, the service offers high intensity home-based support and therapy that are tailored to meet the individual needs of young people and their families and carers. It offers effective&#8212;and cost-effective&#8212;therapeutic management of young people who are suffering from severe mental health problems who, as a result, need minimal, if any, hospitalisation. The project sounds very worth while, and other health boards would do well to consider it&#8212;especially given the 27 per cent rise in the number of children who were, as Labour&#8217;s amendment points out, admitted to adult wards last year.</p><p>I am conscious that I have rambled a bit around different aspects of mental health. However, I think that the debate gives us the opportunity to look at service provision from all angles. I commend Jim Hume for leading the debate.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health"}, {"date": "2014-04-02", "body": "<p>I add my congratulations to Mark McDonald on bringing the subject to the chamber and on his interesting and heartfelt contribution. I also congratulate him on his successful efforts to promote relaxed theatre and cinema in Aberdeen.</p><p>As today marks the seventh annual world autism awareness day, I will touch on some of the facts associated with the condition, and how a greater understanding is a huge advantage to helping people with autism lead a normal life. Autism affects millions of people around the world, including more than 700,000 in the UK alone. The condition affects how a person communicates and socially interacts but, as it has no physical signs, autism is often difficult to diagnose. Early intervention is essential.</p><p>Mark McDonald&#8217;s motion refers to theatre productions of &#8220;Cinderella&#8221; and &#8220;The Lion King&#8221;, and it is also interesting to note that at least six cinemas in Scotland now regularly offer autism-friendly screenings. Necessary adjustments, such as not making a screening too dark and reducing the loud movie volume, all help to enable an individual with autism to enjoy the performance.</p><p>Such initiatives are relatively recent and have their origins in the United States through the Theatre Development Fund, which created a programme that made theatres and cinemas more accessible to children and adults on the autistic spectrum. However, as these improvements in sensory-friendly establishments have occurred only in the past five years, we still have some catching up to do.</p><p>As we will all be aware, one of the characteristics of someone with autism is to be lively and often noisy and, in the confines of a cinema or theatre, such behaviour is wrongly frowned on by people who do not understand autism. Similarly, the desire to move around will not be acceptable to some of the audience. The great advantage of special screenings or performances is that people with autism, especially children, do not feel restrained. Moreover, the adjustments to lighting and sound remove any fear or trauma that an autistic person in a cinema or theatre might experience.</p><p>I will end my brief speech by mentioning a case I read about that highlights the need for people with autism to be given greater access to the arts. Daniel is a 10-year-old boy with Asperger syndrome who likes to talk to the characters on the screen. On one occasion, he was watching &#8220;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&#8221; when he became convinced that a spider had crawled across the screen. He wanted to share that with everyone around him and asked them if they, too, had seen the spider. The inevitable hissing and complaining that followed were very hurtful to Daniel&#8217;s mum and quite rightly made her feel very angry.</p><p>That is why the kinds of initiatives that we are discussing this evening are to be welcomed, and I pay tribute to cinema chains such as Vue and Cineworld for putting individuals ahead of profit. It is certainly the right approach.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Autism-friendly Theatre and Cinema"}, {"date": "2014-04-02", "body": "<p>That sounds very interesting. I might even attend the performance myself to see what it is like.</p><p>I would certainly like this approach to be extended.

The dosage is adjusted according to the time that it takes for a blood sample to clot. Because serious complications can occur if warfarin is poorly controlled, it is vital for patient welfare that the clotting time is checked frequently. Traditionally, of course, that has been done through hospital-based anticoagulant clinics.</p><p>I first brought the issue of self-monitoring and self-management of anticoagulation therapy to the Parliament in 2010, because it appeared to me to be a cost-effective and beneficial way of enabling appropriate patients to be partners in their care, in line with the Government policy of encouraging self-monitoring and self-management of long-term conditions, when that can be done appropriately and safely.</p><p>At that time, Scotland lagged behind England and the rest of Europe, and that remains the situation today. Only 1 per cent of patients on warfarin in Scotland self-manage their treatment, whereas across the UK as a whole the figure is 2 per cent. Approximately 740 people in Scotland self-monitor out of 25,000 in the UK, but 70,000 people in Germany do so.</p><p>NHS boards in Scotland generally do not provide support for self-monitoring or self-management of anticoagulation therapy; for example, in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde only 40 adults self-manage, which is a quarter of 1 per cent of the 16,000 patients on the treatment, whereas there is very good provision in Yorkhill hospital for paediatric patients to self-manage. Unfortunately, as children in that area who can self-manage reach the age of transition to adult services, they have to return their monitors and go back to attending clinics for treatment. In fact, only three health boards in Scotland have protocols for self-management of transitional patients.</p><p>In my own region, NHS Tayside actively discourages patient self-monitoring, or PSM, and I am told that it has even refused support when PSM was recommended to a patient by a consultant cardiologist. NHS Grampian as yet gives no formal support, with the development of a protocol for self-monitoring being delayed due to a lack of enthusiasm for it from the various parties that need to be involved.</p><p>However, there is growing support for change and there are pockets of best practice in Scotland. A good example is Largs Medical Group, which is actively supporting 13 people to self-test through its active self-management service. Increasingly, there are drivers for change. For example, Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network guideline 129, on antithrombotics, states:</p><p>&#8220;Self monitoring and self dosing is safe and effective and can be considered for some patients.&#8221;</p><p>The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh also encourages the use of self-management, stating:</p><p>&#8220;Anticoagulant control may be improved by near patient testing and engaging patients in their own care; patient education should be supported at every stage.&#8221;</p><p>NHS Scotland&#8217;s 2020 vision for the NHS emphasises a focus on prevention, anticipation and supporting self-management, with the person at the centre of all decisions. Finally, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#8217;s draft guidance recommends self-monitoring for people on long-term anticoagulation therapy. The final report by NICE on self-testing systems is due to be published in July, with the expectation that self-testing will be increasingly supported in England and Wales, which could let Scotland slip even further behind.</p><p>Unfortunately, the greatest resistance to self-testing for those who wish it seems to come from general practitioners and clinicians, according to the Anticoagulation Self-Monitoring Alliance. That point was brought out in a round-table discussion last year on the potential for the self-monitoring of anticoagulation that was attended by senior clinicians and patient groups and which resulted in four recommendations: first, that SIGN guideline 129 should be supported; secondly, that a review of the uptake of appropriate technology in Scotland compared with that in England and the rest of Europe should be undertaken; thirdly, that a learning-needs assessment for clinicians, GPs and other healthcare professionals should be carried out; and, fourthly, that consideration should be given to setting up a national service delivery model for anticoagulation to encourage health boards to promote self-management to appropriate patients.</p><p>On cost-effectiveness, studies carried out by the NHS in mid-Yorkshire and by health economists in the University of York showed that the NHS in Scotland could be saved around &#163;600,000 a year from the prevention of strokes through the improved control of anticoagulation achieved by self-monitoring patients. Furthermore, all the patients who took part in the mid-Yorkshire study agreed that self-testing had been beneficial and would recommend it to others.</p><p>In her response to my earlier members&#8217; business debate on the issue, the then health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, was somewhat lukewarm about the self-management of anticoagulation, given earlier clinical advice and the fact that newer anticoagulant agents might replace warfarin. However, warfarin is still the treatment of choice for many patients, and expert advice is changing. Indeed, replies from the current health secretary to some recent parliamentary questions from my colleague Richard Lyle show that the Scottish Government is now taking account of SIGN guideline 129. However, with a rate of self-monitoring in Scotland that is still less than 1 per cent, something does not add up.</p><p>The response from the Government to another question from Richard Lyle about what support is available to patients in transition from paediatric to adult services was that local protocols for the delivery of anticoagulation management vary across Scotland but are in line with SIGN guideline 129 and that, at the time of transition, on-going warfarin management, including self-testing, would be agreed as part of an overall plan of healthcare&#8212;clearly, that is not generally the case.</p><p>Understandably it has been put to me that there is a significant difference between the answers that were given to Richard Lyle and the reality on the ground, where little or nothing appears to be happening by way of implementation. I would welcome the minister&#8217;s comments on that when he sums up because the Government needs to do more to ensure that patients are given the option to self-manage than just saying that that is the case.</p><p>I will conclude my speech as I did my 2010 speech, because it is still relevant to do so, by urging the Government to look closely at how anticoagulant therapy is managed and to consider investigating the potential for increasing self-testing and self-management with a view to rolling it out across health boards to suitable patients, thus saving the NHS money and improving the quality of care for the large and increasing number of people in Scotland who need long-term anticoagulation therapy.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Anticoagulation Therapy (Self-management)"}, {"date": "2014-04-01", "body": "<p>I absolutely accept that there is a difference between the two, and I made that very clear in the debate that I had a few years back.

We no longer fear smallpox and we can travel safely in places in which tropical diseases are rife, thanks to the many vaccines that have been developed over the years to give protection from those diseases.</p><p>I well remember a student visit that I made to Yugoslavia in the 1960s as part of a public health tour, when I saw several cases of tetanus in which the virus had entered the body through roughened skin on heels that had been in contact with earth tracks. At the time, I had a few painful hacks on my own heels and I was very thankful for the tetanus vaccination that I had had prior to setting out on my travels, because tetanus is not a pleasant disease.</p><p>I also recall that I had to have a typhoid vaccination before entering Yugoslavia, to ensure that I was not a carrier, because we had just had a significant outbreak of the disease in Aberdeen as the result of a contaminated batch of corned beef.</p><p>Closer to home, I still vividly recall the very painful photophobia I experienced while suffering from measles as a child. My husband had an iron lung on standby for him when he contracted polio during the UK outbreak shortly after the end of the second world war. Fortunately, he experienced no lasting effects of the disease, nor did I suffer the serious complications of measles. However, we were lucky. It concerns me that there have been several cases of measles in Scotland recently, as well as outbreaks of whooping cough, which indicate the continuing need to maintain high levels of immunisation in childhood that, unfortunately, were adversely affected by the MMR scare a few years ago.</p><p>To be able to protect the population from the damage caused by common infections such as rubella and the long-term effects of HPV, leading to cervical cancer and increasingly recognised as a causative factor in other malignancies such as oropharyngeal and other cancers, is an enormous benefit resulting from many years of valuable research. Each year we hear of further vaccines being developed that could, in due course, eliminate many of the scourges of modern-day society.</p><p>The introduction of the meningitis B vaccine into the childhood immunisation programme, which the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommends, is a case in point, because meningitis B is now the commonest form of meningitis in the UK and accounts for 90 per cent of meningococcal infections. That follows the success of the meningitis C vaccination campaign in all but eliminating that form of the disease, with only two cases of seragroup C reported in Scotland since 2007.</p><p>Meningitis B is a devastating illness; babies under a year old are particularly at risk. It can kill within 24 hours of initial symptoms and, indeed, does kill 10 per cent of those infected, while a third of survivors suffer lifelong consequences. The recommendation to include the meningitis B vaccine in the immunisation programme for babies is very much to be welcomed, as is the Scottish Government&#8217;s stated intention to work with health departments across the UK to ensure its speedy inclusion in the immunisation programme.</p><p>We all know the benefits of the influenza vaccine in keeping vulnerable people safe from influenza&#8217;s complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. Many elderly and immunosuppressed people are alive today as a result of the annual vaccination programme in Scotland, while many have also benefited from the pneumococcal vaccine, one application of which gives lifelong protection from the pneumonia caused by the organism.</p><p>The extension of the flu vaccination to children is an important development, as is the vaccination against rotavirus. I also very much welcome the herpes zoster vaccine that Labour&#8217;s amendment refers to, as I have seen the painful and debilitating effect of the herpes zoster virus, particularly in susceptible elderly people. Shingles was the trigger that led to my mother&#8217;s death in her 80s. She lived for a year after developing the illness, but it led to her steady decline, both physically and mentally, and she never regained the quality of life that she had had before she was hit by the virus.</p><p>There are many other vaccines that we could discuss, both those available today and those in the pipeline, but time does not allow for that in a short debate. Suffice it to say that I whole-heartedly support the motion, which articulates the clear benefits and crucial importance of immunisation programmes to our public health, and I am encouraged that the annual uptake of childhood vaccination is as high as 97 per cent.</p><p>We cannot be complacent, however, because it is extremely important that the high level of uptake is maintained to protect the community. It follows that we must support health boards, and primary care staff in particular, to maintain their commitment to immunisation, despite the pressures that that will put on their workforce, as Richard Simpson&#8217;s amendment highlights. We will undoubtedly see more and more life-saving vaccines coming on stream as a result of cutting-edge research being carried out in the UK and elsewhere.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-09446.2, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;; welcomes the announcement by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation that the meningitis B vaccine is to be introduced into the routine childhood immunisation programme at two, four and 12 months of age, and looks forward to the Scottish Government implementing this programme as soon as possible&#8221;.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Immunisation Programme"}, {"date": "2014-03-18", "body": "<p>I add my voice to those who have congratulated John Wilson on lodging the motion, particularly as the debate is taking place at the start of UN world Down&#8217;s syndrome awareness week.</p><p>I would be surprised if a single member in the chamber or anyone in the public gallery&#8212;or indeed in communities throughout Scotland&#8212;was unfamiliar with the condition known as Down&#8217;s syndrome.</p><p>Despite being something that has always existed, and despite research by John Langdon Down in the mid-19th century, until relatively recently people with Down&#8217;s syndrome were severely stigmatised.

I commend the fact that Down&#8217;s Syndrome Scotland recently celebrated its 30th birthday. I congratulate the charity on the enormous support that it has provided across Scotland for people with Down&#8217;s syndrome, their families and the professionals in the field.</p><p>Branches of Down&#8217;s Syndrome Scotland stretch from Grampian to Tayside and Fife, from Edinburgh to central Scotland and across to the west and Ayrshire. Each local group is active in assisting individuals and families in their communities.</p><p>I was interested to read about the communication skills project, which is highlighted in the motion, which is assessed by the University of Strathclyde and is looking at ways to improve speech and language abilities in children as early as possible. As with so many areas in medicine and support services, early intervention is often the key to providing successful help for people with Down&#8217;s syndrome to realise their potential. That is essential in the early years, when children need such support to improve their communication skills, which in turn will help them to learn at a faster rate.</p><p>Another area that requires greater emphasis&#8212;and one in which Down&#8217;s Syndrome Scotland is leading the way&#8212;is continuous professional development for professionals, such as teachers, health visitors and midwives. As the old adage says, one is never too old to learn new skills. By providing those tools through accredited courses, a greater understanding of Down&#8217;s syndrome can be gained.</p><p>The time available to me this evening does not allow me to cover every aspect of the tremendous work that is undertaken by Down&#8217;s Syndrome Scotland, but I would like to mention the subject of screening. Advances in this field have ensured that women and their partners have access to the appropriate information in terms of explaining the difference between screening and diagnosis and discussing the options available. Pre-diagnostic support for pregnant women to make them aware of the possibility of having a baby with Down&#8217;s syndrome should be more widely available.</p><p>Similarly, there has to be postnatal care in hospital for parents of babies born with Down&#8217;s syndrome. Such things as Down&#8217;s Syndrome Scotland&#8217;s baby packs in maternity units should be part of the overall level of support that is provided for parents who are made aware of their child&#8217;s condition.</p><p>Thankfully, the number of terminations following a prenatal diagnosis of Down&#8217;s syndrome has fallen in England and Wales. I do not have the figures, but I imagine that the trend would be the same in Scotland.</p><p>I want finally to touch on the involvement of people with Down&#8217;s syndrome in culture and the media. I very much welcome the fact that actors with Down&#8217;s syndrome&#8212;who are often very talented&#8212;now play roles in mainstream television programmes such as &#8220;Eastenders&#8221;, &#8220;Holby City&#8221; and &#8220;Upstairs Downstairs&#8221; and in films such as &#8220;Notes on a Scandal&#8221;. However, it has taken far too long to achieve such involvement. Culture should represent society and, given that people with Down&#8217;s syndrome are obviously part of society, they should be playing a part in our media. Perhaps that is a key component of ending the stigma of Down&#8217;s syndrome.</p><p>As a member for North East Scotland, I hope that Down&#8217;s Syndrome Scotland&#8217;s charity dinner&#8212;called Scotland with soul&#8212;in Aberdeen this Friday, which will include music, dancing, an auction and a raffle, is a great success.</p><p>I thank John Wilson again for bringing this issue to the chamber and I wish all those involved in Down&#8217;s syndrome awareness week every success in raising awareness of this common condition and helping those affected achieve their full potential as equal and active members of Scottish society.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Down&#8217;s Syndrome Awareness Week"}, {"date": "2014-03-12", "body": "<p>Like the cabinet secretary&#8212;and, I presume, the minister&#8212;I am anxious that health does not become a political football in the chamber.</p><p>We currently enjoy a reciprocal arrangement because we are part of the United Kingdom; my family has benefited from it.

We will support the motion at decision time.</p><p>I cut my medical teeth at the University of Aberdeen on the pioneering work of Professor Nelson Norman, who was at that time a senior lecturer in surgery, in developing remote healthcare, which would soon be used for the benefit of people who were employed in the growing oil and gas industry in the North Sea. It is particularly appropriate that the first director of the recently established digital health institute, Professor George Crooks, is also a graduate of that university and an experienced former practitioner at the coalface of primary care in the city of Aberdeen.</p><p>The institute has been set up with the remit to promote innovation through the use of technology in supporting people to live longer and healthier lives at home or in a homely setting and, as a result, to generate economic benefit for Scotland as a leader in the growing global digital healthcare market. The DHI&#8217;s collaborative work will position it well to assist the delivery by health boards, local authorities and the third sector of the outcomes that are envisaged in the 2020 vision for NHS Scotland. That work is open to anyone with an interest in digital health and improving technologies in Scotland and beyond, and there is significant interest among the business community&#8212;particularly among the small digital health business community.</p><p>The briefing that the institute sent us refers to exciting new developments that are in the pipeline, one of which is the assessment of new technologies to allow for easier identification and earlier treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation, which is a common cause of heart failure and stroke in the elderly. Recording on a smartphone an electrocardiogram that can then be interpreted remotely has enormous potential for reducing unnecessary hospital admissions and allowing patients to self-monitor their condition, which would be reassuring for patients and would allow GPs to better tailor their care to patients&#8217; needs.</p><p>Such developments will have a major impact on patient healthcare journeys, especially for those who live in the more remote and rural parts of the country, by allowing earlier diagnosis and triage well outwith the acute healthcare setting and enabling those who do not need admission to be cared for in the community, while those who need it will have speedy access to the specialist facilities that their condition requires.</p><p>There are many exciting possibilities, and I look forward to hearing a lot more about the innovative healthcare that results from the DHI&#8217;s collaborative work.</p><p>I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s announcement today of financial support for health boards to expand home health monitoring programmes. I also welcome his proposal on the universal availability of personalised electronic patient records by 2020 at the latest. I could have done with such a record recently. I turned up for a rescheduled appointment for pre-op assessment, but I had not been told that the venue had changed, so my notes were at a different hospital. That meant that my appointment had to be rescheduled again, even though the nurse was free to see me because another patient had not turned up. Of course, the nurse could not see me without having my notes. An electronic record would have been useful.</p><p>As we have heard, there are a number of successful uses of technology in healthcare. It can be used in the monitoring and management of long-term conditions such as chronic heart failure and COPD. Skin lesions can be diagnosed remotely by a dermatologist, and an endoscopy can be assessed by a consultant via videoconferencing equipment. Many traumatic injuries can be assessed remotely by the same means. That all saves unnecessary journeys to hospital for patients and is an efficient use of specialists&#8217; time, cutting back on the time that they spend travelling to remote and island communities. Patients are happy, and, by and large, staff are happy.</p><p>I must mention the excellent work that many optometrists in Scotland are doing. Digital retinal screening is picking up many health problems early, when they can be managed effectively. I urge everyone, particularly people in the older age groups, to have the regular free eye checks that are available to them. That could save them a great deal of grief in future and help them to live safely and independently in their homes and communities well into old age.</p><p>It is taking a long time for telehealth and telecare to catch on in some board areas, especially when we consider that some of the technology that we have been talking about was available in the 1960s. Given the enormous and increasing demands on the NHS, further innovation through technology will be vital if the 2020 vision for health and social care is to be achieved and if the integration of health and social care is to achieve the best outcomes for patients, with everyone who is involved in care planning, including patients and carers, having meaningful input in the patient journey.</p><p>We have a long way to go. Delayed discharge is on the way up again&#8212;in my area, that is due to the difficulty in recruiting home carers, given the lure of the oil and gas industry. There is severe pressure on acute hospital beds, and patients are complaining that they must wait an unreasonable time to see a GP. In my 10 years as an MSP, I can honestly say that I have never had so many disgruntled patients get in touch with me as I have had in the past two or three months.</p><p>The Royal College of Nursing Scotland summed up the situation well in its briefing. It said:</p><p>&#8220;While the 2020 vision for our NHS is a very positive plan for patient care, the pressures on our NHS have become more intense since its launch in 2011. New policy directions, such as the integration of health and social care, 7 day working and unscheduled care, to name but a few, on top of day-to-day activity to meet targets and standards, mean that decision makers in our health boards are being pulled in too many directions. So now is a good time for politicians, the NHS and local authorities to have a renewed focus on the 2020 vision, to ensure it becomes a reality.&#8221;</p><p>Technology is clearly a key factor in achieving that reality, but only in conjunction with our dealing with the existing pressures that are working against it. I support the Scottish Government in its pursuit of innovation to achieve high-quality patient-centred care, but I urge it not to lose sight of the growing pressures on the NHS, which are threatening the achievement of those aims.</p><p>I am not convinced that Labour&#8217;s demand for an independent review of the service is necessary, which is why we will not support Richard Simpson&#8217;s amendment, but it is right to draw attention to the problems that face the NHS in Scotland. We will support Jim Hume&#8217;s amendment.</p><p>I look forward to further updates on the 2020 vision in the months ahead.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Scotland (2020 Vision)"}, {"date": "2014-03-05", "body": "<p>I, too, thank Linda Fabiani for lodging the motion, which once again recognises Marie Curie Cancer Care&#8217;s great daffodil appeal, and I should say that the debate follows a debate that I sponsored last September on Marie Curie Cancer Care&#8217;s signpost to palliative care.</p><p>It is now getting on for 30 years since the great daffodil appeal was launched and I am sure that in two years&#8217; time we will have a great celebration to mark that anniversary. As we have heard, the appeal has raised more than &#163;70 million across the UK, with &#163;4 million a year raised in Scotland alone.</p><p>Each March, many of us wear the distinctive daffodil that is the symbol of Marie Curie Cancer Care. I do not mean to be disparaging when I say that, apart from the poppy that I wear in November, I do not tend to wear any other badge that signifies a charity. That does not mean that I do not support other organisations or charities, but I have a particular affinity with the tremendous work that Marie Curie nurses perform.</p><p>At the core of Marie Curie Cancer Care is an emphasis on helping people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible or on providing the right environment in which palliative care meets the needs of individual patients. We are fortunate in Scotland to have two excellent Marie Curie hospices, one in Edinburgh and one in Glasgow, that cater for a range of people who are facing the end of life because of cancer or other terminal illnesses.</p><p>I am aware of the huge work that Marie Curie undertakes in my North East Scotland region and was fascinated by some of the statistics that Richard Meade, the head of policy and public affairs for Marie Curie in Scotland, gave me. A remarkable 88 per cent of patients looked after by Marie Curie Cancer Care who live within the NHS Grampian area and a further 91 per cent of people in NHS Tayside were able to die in their preferred place of death, whether that was at home, in hospital or in a hospice.</p><p>The 24/7 provision of planned Marie Curie nursing care and the rapid response team that covers Aberdeenshire are a testament to the dedication of its staff, and it is also worth noting that, last year, the 1,700 Marie Curie patients in the north-east received 9,559 visits from Marie Curie nurses, who provided more than 25,000 hours of support and care to patients in the Grampian region.</p><p>Of course, we cannot forget the community fundraising groups right across Scotland and particularly, for me, in the north-east that raise so much money for Marie Curie Cancer Care. In my region, those groups stretch from Ellon and the Garioch in rural Aberdeenshire to the heart of the Mearns in Angus&#8212;and I should say that I see two friends of mine from upper Deeside sitting in the gallery.</p><p>In the debate that I led on Marie Curie Cancer Care&#8217;s work, my motion specifically focused on what I described as a difficulty in discussing death and dying. I reiterate what I said at the time: we should not be afraid to talk about death and particularly about cancer-related illnesses and the consequences of the devastating news that a condition is terminal.</p><p>I will finish by mentioning my friend and former colleague, David McLetchie, who as we know succumbed to cancer last year. His bravery in dealing with his illness is well known and the fact that he attended the Parliament almost until the end of his life has been acknowledged by many members across the chamber. The care and dedication given to cancer sufferers at St Columba&#8217;s hospice in Edinburgh, where David spent his last days, is recognised throughout Scotland, and we are very grateful for its work.</p><p>Like many charities, Marie Curie Cancer Care plays a very important role in dealing with the effects of cancer and other terminal illnesses. However, despite the many families that have had to deal with this kind of devastating diagnosis, we are still inclined to avoid talking about its consequences.</p><p>I am grateful to Linda Fabiani for bringing this debate to the chamber, to Marie Curie for its tremendous work in supporting the patients and families who have to cope with the multiple problems of terminal illness and to the loyal fundraisers who raise so much money for the organisation.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Marie Curie Cancer Care"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14064.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14064", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Nanette Milne", "member_id": "80522", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "North East Scotland"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Nanette", "last_name": "Milne", "left_house": "2011-03-23", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14064.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14064", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Nanette Milne", "member_id": "80364", "entered_house": "2007-05-03", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "North East Scotland"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Nanette", "last_name": "Milne", "left_house": "2007-04-02", "title": "Mrs", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14064.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14064", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Mrs Nanette Milne", "member_id": "80086", "entered_house": "2003-05-01", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "North East Scotland"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "McInnes", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>In seeking to appeal to women voters, the nationalists continue to tout uncosted plans and peddle myths on the currency, childcare and most recently the national health service&#8212;anything to distract from their record of failing women across Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Government claims that it wants the powers to ensure that 40 per cent of public board members are women, but that does not stand up favourably to scrutiny.

Although the SNP&#8217;s apparent conversion to the cause is welcome, its bona fides must be questioned given its record of inaction.</p><p>Elsewhere, as Mary Scanlon said, Scottish Government cuts to college places have greatly restricted opportunities to learn. Colleges Scotland tells us that the number of women studying part time has halved, plunging from 200,000 in 2007 to less than 100,000 today. Thousands of women who find it impossible to study full time have missed out. They are parents, carers and those with work or financial commitments.

Liberal Democrats campaigned for 18 months for the extension of free childcare provision, as we know that it is one of the best ways to address the disadvantages that our most vulnerable children face and to enable more parents to remain in or return to work.</p><p>Again and again, ministers told us that they could not help more than 1 per cent of two-year-olds without additional powers.

The service provided by general practitioners and primary healthcare teams&#8212;from professionals covering vast remote areas to those working in large city practices&#8212;is appreciated the length and breadth of the country and admired across the chamber.</p><p>Amid a wealth of specialisms and the involvement of departments across the health service and beyond, GPs are often the only constant during a patient&#8217;s care, identifying symptoms, assessing needs, signposting to other services and co-ordinating a joined-up approach to the patient&#8217;s care. That continuity means that GPs are capable of developing the most acute understanding of individuals&#8217; overall health.</p><p>Providing more than 24 million consultations each year, GPs are integral to improving Scotland&#8217;s health and wellbeing and to the objective to shift the balance of treatment and care away from hospitals towards primary settings.</p><p>The your GP cares campaign highlights the need for that patient shift to be accompanied by an appropriate transfer of resources to and investment in primary care team personnel and practice infrastructure. It draws our attention to the challenges posed by patients&#8217; changing needs.</p><p>In the gallery today is Dr Alan McDevitt, chairman of the BMA&#8217;s Scottish GP committee. He tells us:</p><p>&#8220;There are more patients to see, more test results to read and more paperwork. Yet there are still the same number of hours in the day and many GP surgeries are simply overwhelmed.&#8221;</p><p>ISD Scotland data shows that the number of patient contacts with GPs and practice nurses has increased by 10 per cent during the past decade. Twelve per cent of registered patients now visit their local practice 10 or more times a year. The intense workload can, in part, be attributed to our growing ageing population and the need to support people who are living longer with complex, chronic or multiple health conditions. Long-term conditions already account for the majority of consultations, but the prevalence of conditions such as dementia will soar as the number of people aged over 75 doubles during the next 20 years.</p><p>The demands on general practice are particularly acute in my own North East Scotland region, and there is real concern that they are affecting GPs&#8217; ability to best care for their patients. Official statistics show that six of the biggest 20 practices, by patient list size, are in the north-east. Many serve areas with burgeoning populations and two possess more than 20,000 patients. Facilities are already creaking and yet the third national planning framework, which was published this week, reminds us the north-east&#8217;s population will grow by 23 per cent by 2035.</p><p>A question mark still hangs over the provision of a medical centre for the new town of Chapelton&#8212;a development that will provide up to 8,000 homes. That has caused my constituents to fear that the nearby Portlethen medical centre, which is already one of the busiest in the country, could soon be overwhelmed. Elsewhere, staff at Ellon health centre are striving to provide for a growing community, but they are hampered by premises that are no longer fit for purpose, having been built when the town was a fraction of its current size. NHS Grampian says that it will be &#8220;some years&#8221; before it is replaced. Such situations are common across Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrats believe that communities know best how to run locally responsive services. It would therefore be remiss of me not to note that the Scottish Government seized control of health boards&#8217; capital budgets, stripping them of powers to tackle infrastructure problems as they see fit. This year, NHS Grampian will receive less than 2 per cent of non-formula capital spend for specific projects.</p><p>This week, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing confirmed to my colleague Jim Hume that the proportion of the NHS budget that is spent on primary medical services has fallen under this Government. It peaked at 9.1 per cent under the Liberal Democrat-Labour Administration and has fallen to 7.5 per cent this year.</p><p>General practice is the gateway to the wider NHS. Clinical decisions that are made in general practice commit more than half of total NHS expenditure. The Scottish Government must therefore ensure that general practice is sufficiently resourced to take the right decisions and that opportunities to build relationships with patients, understand their needs and effectively communicate what is happening are enhanced, not diminished, as care shifts from acute to primary settings.</p><p>Indeed, GPs&#8217; workloads have already soared as the profession struggles to attract and retain talent. Young doctors appear to be pursuing other specialisms. In the Aberdeenshire community health partnership, the number who are working part time has increased by 9 per cent in the past five years alone. Worryingly, I have been told that early retirements are up, with more than a third of staff in their 50s. Others are emigrating in search of a better work-life balance.</p><p>This morning, The Scotsman reported that more than 30 practices across Scotland are operating an &#8220;open but full&#8221; policy and are accepting registrations on a limited basis only. However, Dr McDevitt has told us that many practices</p><p>&#8220;wouldn&#8217;t be able to take on a new doctor even if they wanted to.&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Government must therefore intensify its efforts to attract and retain GPs and reverse the losses that have been experienced during the past three years.</p><p>We cannot expect GPs and practice staff to spend more time with patients and provide more appropriate care closer to home without sufficient resources, additional staff or appropriate facilities. As the nature of primary care changes, it is imperative that health boards and GPs are capable of responding to local needs and demands. They must be empowered to provide integrated and sustainable primary health services that are rooted in communities, focused on every aspect of patients&#8217; health, delivered in a fitting environment and of the highest quality.</p><p>I would be grateful if the minister could therefore tell us whether he considers the current distribution of total NHS expenditure to be appropriate. Will he hand back some power over capital spending to boards or ensure a fairer allocation? I would welcome details of how he intends to attract and retain the staff who are required to deliver shared objectives, including those of enhancing preventative care, reducing hospital admissions, tackling the unacceptable number of delayed discharges and integrating adult health and social care services.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Your GP Cares Campaign"}, {"date": "2014-06-26", "body": "<p>I am a little bit disturbed by the angle that the member is taking.

After months of considering objections, members of the committee would be forgiven for thinking that no one supported the council taking the proposed course of action, so Kezia Dugdale&#8217;s speech was welcome, in that it reminded us just how much support there is in the community for that course of action.</p><p>As has been referred to, over the past week all members will have received emails urging them to vote against the bill. In those emails, objectors claim:</p><p>&#8220;The bill has not been properly scrutinised; evidence has been ignored and objections have been dismissed without even being heard.&#8221;</p><p>Others complain that the bill is being rushed through, and some suggest that the outcome of the bill process was agreed before it even started.</p><p>As a member of the committee who has invested countless hours in the process over the past 13 months, I completely refute those claims. I believe that all members of the committee carried out their duties objectively and conscientiously. We set out our views in a detailed way in two separate reports&#8212;our preliminary stage report and our consideration stage report. At this point, it is appropriate for me to take the opportunity to thank the clerks who supported us in that process.</p><p>The bill was introduced in April 2013 and the committee has been dealing with it at consideration stage since January. That is hardly rushing it. The procedures that the committee followed ensured that the promoter and the objectors had a fair opportunity to have their respective cases presented. It is worth emphasising that the fact that objections were not upheld by the committee does not in any way indicate that the committee did not take into account all the concerns that were put forward in the objections. Indeed, the committee considered the issues that were raised in a number of ways: through the consideration of individual objections; by giving every objector the opportunity to submit supplementary written evidence at consideration stage; and by ensuring that every objector had the opportunity to be represented by a lead objector at oral evidence sessions.</p><p>In a number of areas, the committee acknowledged or accepted that it was possible that there could be a detrimental effect on objectors&#8217; private interests as a result of the construction of the school. For example, we accepted that it was inevitable that there would be some adverse impact from operational disturbance while the school was being constructed and thereafter. However, we were also satisfied that that had been subject to the planning process and that measures would be implemented to mitigate any such impact.</p><p>Our role as a private bill committee was to reach a view on the extent to which an individual&#8217;s private interests would be affected, and the extent to which that was balanced by the general benefit to the wider community as a result of the school being built. As the convener said, we ultimately concluded&#8212;taking account of factors such as the compensatory and mitigation measures that would be implemented&#8212;that the general benefits that would be brought to the community as a result of the proposal were more significant than the private interests of those who might be adversely affected.</p><p>As the convener explained, only one amendment was lodged during phase 2. It was lodged by me and it was agreed to unanimously. Section 2A of the revised bill will ensure that, once the status of the park has been changed for the limited purposes in question, should that use cease, the inalienable common good status would reapply automatically. It provides safeguards regarding any future use of the land and it protects its inalienable common good status in circumstances in which the land is no longer used for an educational purpose, or in which it is not used for such a purpose in the first instance.</p><p>It is worth remarking on the apparently polarised positions of the parties involved with the bill. It is clear that the council has much to do to rebuild trust in some sections of the community. It has an opportunity to do that in taking forward the replacement open space&#8212;getting everyone involved to shape the exact nature of that provision could be a way to bring the different factions together around a positive outcome for the community.</p><p>If the bill is passed today&#8212;and I, for one, will support it&#8212;I really hope that the energy and determination that objectors have so far spent on trying to prevent the school from being built on the park, perfectly legitimately, will now be harnessed to ensure that the community of Portobello gets the school that it so badly needs.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill: Final Stage"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>I, too, welcome the debate, which is fitting in refugee week.</p><p>I have no doubt that, across the chamber, we want to see the asylum system constantly improving and evolving.

Philippa is one of a growing number of clinicians to speak out about the threat to the Scottish NHS from the privatisation agenda in England, which my colleague Aileen McLeod outlined. However, as Philippa speaks to full halls all over the country, she makes another striking point. Most of her patients are older women and, like any good doctor, she asks them what support they have at home to help them to recuperate from surgery. Far too often, they tell her that they have no support because their grown-up children have moved away&#8212;sometimes abroad, but more often to the south of England.</p><p>As the First Minister said, Scotland loses almost 40,000 young people every year, and they are our brightest and best. According to recent figures from the Office for National Statistics, Scotland has the best-educated population in Europe, in terms of not just the high proportion of people with degrees but the high number of people with good vocational qualifications. In an area that this Parliament fully controls&#8212;education&#8212;we have established ourselves as a world leader. However, in an area that we do not control&#8212;economic and fiscal policy&#8212;we are victims of our success in education, because we cannot provide the sort of jobs that those highly educated and ambitious young people want.</p><p>That is not a new trend. Professor Tom Devine, our most eminent historian&#8212;who, as my colleague Aileen McLeod said, has come out for yes, like so many other Scots&#8212;wrote in his book on the Scottish diaspora about the union dividend, which resulted in huge mass migration from Scotland.</p><p>Scotland was the only country among European countries of a similar size&#8212;Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Ireland&#8212;to have a falling population between 1950 and 2000. That trend has reversed under the present Government, but we need to do so much more because the outward migration of our young people is greater than in other parts of the UK. That is partly because of the pull of London: eight out of 10 new jobs in the private sector are created in London, and the sort of jobs that are being created in London are attracting our young people. London has 14 per cent more jobs in the top employment categories of managers, professionals and technical staff than Scotland. That imbalance has existed for many years.</p><p>Business research and development in the UK is concentrated in the east and south-east of England, a pattern that has held since at least 1990. Scotland has a very low business R and D spend of 0.5 per cent of GDP.</p><p>That explains why, despite being one of the richest countries in the world according to the Financial Times, Scotland is still losing its best talent and why, even in these better times when Scotland is doing relatively well economically&#8212;according to Ernst &amp; Young, we are one of the best-performing areas for inward investment&#8212;we are still losing a high proportion of our young people to outward migration. We need the fiscal levers that are reserved to Westminster and the Scottish tax revenues that flow there to keep our most precious resources of all: the aspirational young Scots who leave in search of a better life.</p><p>The economist Margaret Cuthbert thinks that these things are only going to get worse. She says:</p><p>&#8220;The regional disparities&#8221;</p><p>in the UK</p><p>&#8220;are not some short term phenomenon. Rather they are the result of the fast growing south, particularly London and the City, acting as a magnet for capital and labour from the other parts of the UK.&#8221;</p><p>Borrowing a rather more colourful phrase from the coalition&#8217;s business secretary, Vince Cable, I believe that London is &#8220;a giant suction machine&#8221;, swallowing up not just Scotland&#8217;s wealth but our future wealth creators.</p><p>That is why I am urging a yes vote. Independence is our greatest opportunity to combat the power of the &#8220;giant suction machine&#8221; that Mr Cable has so vividly described. We can do that in several ways, and over the past weeks and months we have outlined several plans for growth, including &#8220;Reindustrialising Scotland for the 21st Century: A Sustainable Industrial Strategy for a Modern, Independent Nation&#8221; and the jobs plan.

Given the destructive power of the weapons, a great many more lives could be lost.</p><p>It is clear that the MOD&#8217;s freedom of information response showed that the weapons cannot go to Devonport. The MOD considered alternative UK sites in 1981 and 1982 and concluded that it would be too controversial and expensive to start from scratch. It took 14 years to adapt Faslane and Coulport for Trident, and building a base from scratch would take much longer.</p><p>Therefore, removing Trident from the Clyde would remove it from the UK, whatever other members have said. That is why CND has taken the position that independence is the easiest and most achievable way of removing nuclear weapons from the UK, and that is why I have great pleasure in supporting the motion.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>I, too, extend my congratulations to Dave Thompson on securing the debate.</p><p>The European convention on human rights says:</p><p>&#8220;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.&#8221;</p><p>We are used to people having a pop at the European convention on human rights, particularly in the media, but in this instance, it is a great pity that that article does not apply beyond Europe to other societies in the world.</p><p>Other members have highlighted the plight of Meriam Ibrahim, the Sudanese mother who was jailed while she was pregnant and had to live with the expectation of being hanged once her baby was born. The focus on her eight-month ordeal personalised a global issue that affects millions of people. As we know, her crime was that she had married a Christian and she was accused by the authorities in Sudan of apostasy or renouncing her faith even though she had never been Muslim in the first place. Although we can rejoice that Meriam and her children are now safe, that is not the case for people in millions of less well-known cases around the world. Members have highlighted a number of cases, including the 3,000 Christians who fled Mosul after the fatwa, and other societies such as North Korea.</p><p>It has been asked on a number of occasions why more attention is not paid to those atrocities, and it has been suggested that those of us from a Christian background might want to reflect on the fact that, despite non-violence being at the heart of true Christianity, for much of the past two millennia Christianity has been the dominant religion of some of the world&#8217;s most powerful empires, and the leaders of those empires have misused it in order to persecute other people. We have only to think about the crusades, the Spanish inquisition or, indeed, the inter-Christian sectarian violence and wars that have resulted in many deaths over the centuries in Europe and which we are, sadly, familiar with in these islands. Perhaps that is the reason why we have not paid more attention to what is happening to Christians now. However, in a sense, because we have come on that journey, that should make us more sensitive to the persecution of people for their religious beliefs.</p><p>According to the International Society for Human Rights, which is a secular group with members in 38 states worldwide, 80 per cent of all acts of religious discrimination in the world are directed against Christians. The Pew Research Center has said that hostility to religion was at its highest in 2012, when Christians in 139 countries faced some sort of discrimination. That accounts for three quarters of the world&#8217;s nations, which is quite a staggering thought.</p><p>In anticipation of this debate, I received letters from constituents who were particularly concerned about the plight of persecuted Christians in Pakistan. I would like to take the opportunity to speak about that in more detail.</p><p>Although the Christian population in Pakistan is barely 3 million&#8212;compared with 180 million Muslims&#8212;Christians have had a considerable impact on Pakistani society, particularly in the field of education. Many of Pakistan&#8217;s most prominent leaders, including the current Prime Minister and the assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, went to Christian schools. Under Pakistan&#8217;s constitution, Christians were guaranteed equal rights, but the recent increased targeting of Christians in Pakistan should be an issue of great concern to the international community.</p><p>While I was researching for this speech, I encountered some horror stories about the scale of the violence that has been directed towards those people. Militant groups are frequently the culprits in attacks on Christians, and it seems that a general anger against the United States&#8217; foreign policy has caused a large number of people to wrongly target Christians, whom they associate with that foreign policy.</p><p>Blasphemy laws are often used as a tool of oppression. For example, in 2012, an 11-year-old Christian girl was arrested after being accused of burning pages of the Qur&#8217;an. In Peshawar, 78 people were killed and 130 were wounded in a fatal attack on a church.</p><p>I could list many other instances, with which we will be familiar or unfamiliar. However, I repeat my colleagues&#8217; appeal for tolerance throughout the world for people whatever their religious background. I look forward to hearing the minister make clear the Scottish Government&#8217;s abhorrence of all persecution on religious grounds, as it has done on previous occasions.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Persecuted Christians"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p></p><p>14.

I contrast its motion with a number of documents that have been published in recent weeks, which envisage the possibilities of a better Scotland in the future. One is &#8220;Re-Thinking Welfare: Fair, Personal &amp; Simple&#8221;, the second report of the expert working group on welfare, which was chaired by Martyn Evans of the Carnegie UK Trust. It sets out a vision for a fairer Scotland for the most vulnerable people in the country, with recommendations on re-establishing a link between benefits and the cost of living and an increase in the carers allowance. It also recommends that the first Government of an independent Scotland should have as its goal a living wage instead of a minimum wage.</p><p>Last week, the First Minister unveiled &#8220;Reindustrialising Scotland for the 21st Century: A Sustainable Industrial Strategy for a Modern, Independent Nation&#8221;, a document that shows that we could grow our manufacturing output by a third and suggests some practical ways to deliver that with the powers of independence&#8212;for example, through a properly funded Scottish business development bank, a simple and more effective tax system and a network of overseas offices that is designed to boost our exports.</p><p>On Monday, the Deputy First Minister published &#8220;The Scottish Independence Bill: A consultation on an interim constitution for Scotland&#8221;. I found reading the draft constitution an encouraging and a moving experience. In particular, the clarity of the language is inspiring. It begins with the simple statement:</p><p>&#8220;In Scotland, the people are sovereign&#8221;.</p><p>Section 3 says:</p><p>&#8220;In Scotland, the people have the sovereign right to self-determination and to choose freely the form in which their State is to be constituted and how they are to be governed.&#8221;</p><p>I have mentioned just three of the many documents that the Government and others have published, outlining a vision of the future&#8212;a vision of welfare, of the economy and of the empowerment of the people. All those documents share an ambition for Scotland. They meet that Samuel Johnson maxim about our aspirations being our possibilities.</p><p>Another Scotland is possible. That is something that the Labour Party used to believe. The motion today suggests that the Labour Party has given up on that belief, given up on ambition and given up on vision. The Labour motion has no vision for a fairer welfare system, and it has nothing to say about growing our economy or truly empowering our people. Instead, the motion talks of the security and stability of the UK. However, a UK that is paying &#163;1 billion a week in debt interest repayments is neither secure nor stable.</p><p>The UK Government has capped welfare, with the support of the Labour Party in Westminster, showing that, in the UK, the most vulnerable face a bleak future. The motion suggests that the UK is okay. However, that welfare cap is not okay. A hundred thousand children in poverty by 2020, as the Child Poverty Action Group has predicted, is not okay. A regionally imbalanced economy in which output in London is 70 per cent higher than the UK average is not okay. Income inequality that is among the worst in the OECD is not okay, either.</p><p>If that is the best vision that Labour has to offer, the people of Scotland should have only two words to say to it: &#8220;No thanks.&#8221;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-06-05", "body": "<p>In their speeches&#8212;particularly those about their own constituents&#8212;members have shown that there is absolutely no lack of talent and ambition among our young people or among Scottish women.</p><p>A number of years ago, the big debate in Scotland was about the low number of business start-ups. We spent a long time wringing our hands and asking whether we had a culture that was hostile to entrepreneurship. I recall from my journalist days that some very bizarre theories were advanced. One theory was that the self-starters had all emigrated to Canada in the 19th century. I am very pleased that we have moved on from that rather negative navel-gazing towards encouraging and supporting the very many people throughout Scotland who are passionate about starting and growing their own business.</p><p>I welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to increase the number of entrepreneurs, and the role that the Scotland can do strategy can play. The strategy uses a team Scotland approach to bring together companies, universities, public agencies and customers to take advantage of the opportunities that drive the establishment and growth of new businesses.</p><p>We cannot overemphasise the importance of the subject. Reading through the strategy document, I was very impressed. It mentions innovation on page 6, and states that</p><p>&#8220;demand from consumers ... is the most important factor in the success or failure of businesses.&#8221;</p><p>Murdo Fraser mentioned a report that said that women are more responsive to consumer demand, and Christine Grahame made a similar point. That is very important.</p><p>I agree with Willie Rennie and other members about the importance of getting more women to excel in and make a career of the STEM subjects. I have a daughter who is a professional engineer. I should mention that she played with Barbies when she was young. In fact, when she came home last Christmas, she found the big Barbie make-up stand that she played with when she was a little girl. She dismantled it, retrieving the spring to fix my doorbell, so maybe Barbie has her uses after all.</p><p>Although I am very encouraging of the drive to get more women into STEM subjects and technical jobs, we should not forget about women&#8217;s responsiveness to consumers and the female economy. Many of the most entrepreneurial women I know work in fashion, beauty and hairdressing, and they set up their own businesses. The challenge in that respect is to ensure that those businesses are properly rewarded and taken seriously.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Improving Entrepreneurship among Women and Young People"}, {"date": "2014-06-05", "body": "<p>I would say that the women to whom I am referring, who run their own beauty and hairdressing businesses, did that by choice. They felt very passionate about the industry.</p><p>Although, as the mother of a professional engineer, I totally encourage women to go into technical professions, we have to be careful about the balance. We should not underplay women&#8217;s achievements in what we might regard as female industries. We should take the female economy, and women as consumers, seriously, as that is an important part of our economy.</p><p>The entrepreneur who I want to praise today is both female and young. She is a fashion designer and manufacturer from Lockerbie called Kelly Alder. She designs and customises shoes and bags and is about to launch her own clothing collection called MISA, which stands for the made in Scotland initiative.</p><p>Kelly&#8217;s business is called Glitzaratti&#8212;as the name suggests, there is a lot of bling involved. She has an extraordinary talent for customising shoes using crystals, beads, diamante and even seashells. I do not think that it is any secret that the cabinet secretary likes her shoes&#8212;I would be delighted to invite her to meet Kelly and see some of her designs, because they really are fantastic, and she has sold a lot of them online.</p><p>Kelly left a well-paid job to start Glitzaratti, and I want to highlight a bit of her own life story. She says:</p><p>&#8220;like many other young people I thought&#8221;</p><p>that the dream of starting a fashion business</p><p>&#8220;would be nothing more than a pipe dream.&#8221;</p><p>However,</p><p>&#8220;after showing the world of facebook some pictures of past designs it all took off with an influx of orders ... within several months&#8221;.</p><p>Kelly is now running third in the international wedding industry awards, which she is very proud of. I wish her the best of luck with that. The internet means that manufacturers such as her can be based in Lockerbie in Dumfriesshire and sell all over the world.</p><p>We have talked about female-orientated industries, and Kelly is absolutely passionate about manufacturing because it is an important aspect of the fashion industry. That is why she called her clothing line the made in Scotland initiative. I understand that there has been a move back to clothing manufacturing in the UK from countries such as China and India, which I think is a good thing. Naturally, it means that the costs can be higher, but the quality is also higher, which certainly comes through in Kelly&#8217;s work.</p><p>Kelly has moved into a shop front in Dumfries. I asked her before the debate about the challenges that she faced, and she said that although there was a huge number of empty shops in Dumfries High Street, she was unable to get one because the people who own them would much rather that they sat empty than rent them at a reasonable market rate. Therefore, she has moved into a shop that is slightly off the High Street.</p><p>Kelly is in her 20s, but older women have a lifetime of experience and the ability to respond to consumer demand. I will talk about a couple of them as well. Heather Hall and Linda Whitelaw have set up a community cafe called The Usual Place in Dumfries. Those women are a fantastic example of the benefits of social enterprise, because they saw a gap in relation to the training of young people with additional support needs. The community cafe will work with the local college to help young people train and work in the hospitality industry. They hope that, as a result, many of them will move into full-time work in the hospitality industry. The two women have secured fantastic premises in the old Dumfries high school dining hall and have been awarded funding from the Big Lottery Fund.</p><p>I think that both those examples show that the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit is alive and well in Scotland. Certainly, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report shows that there has been a rise in early-stage entrepreneurship here. I think that, with the Government&#8217;s strategy and commitment, we will see that continue. I feel quite optimistic about the future and think that we have moved past that hand-wringing stage of the past.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Improving Entrepreneurship among Women and Young People"}, {"date": "2014-06-04", "body": "<p></p><p>9.

I also thank the Carnegie UK Trust for its briefing for the debate, and STV for working closely with me to make the debate possible. I welcome visitors from STV and the University of the West of Scotland to the gallery.</p><p>We in Parliament are all familiar with the challenges for local news in the age of the internet. In the past seven years across the United Kingdom, 242 local newspapers have closed completely, and &#163;400&#160;million of advertising revenue has disappeared. However, the public value local news. As the Carnegie Trust briefing points out, local news is</p><p>&#8220;a hub of citizen engagement&#8221;,</p><p>is &#8220;essential&#8221; to local democracy, and it</p><p>&#8220;connects people to place and each other.&#8221;</p><p>That is reflected in the fact that 73 per cent of us believe that our local media are is the best media for making us feel part of a community.</p><p>For that reason, we should welcome the arrival of the new local television channels. There was, of course, initial disquiet when the first licences in Scotland went to Glasgow and Edinburgh. South Scotland, which I represent, is poorly served by television at the moment, so I commented previously on the logic of that decision. The Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop, raised concerns about it at the time. However, having said that, I warmly welcome the launch of STV Glasgow next week and STV Edinburgh later this year. The regulator, the Office of Communications, will soon invite applications for local TV stations in Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and Ayr, and is considering advertising a licence for Falkirk, so we could have Kelpie TV as well.</p><p>STV Glasgow will begin broadcasting on 2 June&#8212;next Monday&#8212;at half past 6 in the evening. I was fortunate to visit STV&#8217;s new studio on the Clyde a couple of weeks ago, which has been built with a panoramic view of the river and takes in the Finnieston crane, the squinty bridge, the Armadillo and the SSE Hydro, all of which look spectacular. A magazine show will be broadcast against that panorama that will feature cooking with chefs from the city&#8217;s restaurants. I particularly welcome the inclusion of &#8220;Tenement TV&#8221;, which showcases local bands and bands that are visiting the city, because there has been no TV platform in Scotland for unsigned young bands for quite a while. That is an opportunity to develop talent; in that regard, it should also be noted that STV has created 26 new roles for the new TV channel.</p><p>Bobby Hain, who is the director of channels at STV, has reported that advance advertising sales for the new station have been buoyant, with city businesses being attracted by the opportunity to reach a concentrated audience of 2&#160;million at rates that are lower than the national rates. That is all good, and we hope that it will be replicated when local TV licences are rolled out across Scotland.</p><p>The motion for debate today is about fairness for local television and is focused on the need to give it appropriate prominence on the electronic programme guide, which has an important influence on what we watch. In England, local TV appears on channel 8 of the Freeview electronic programme guide, but in Scotland it will be on channel 23, because BBC Alba occupies the channel 8 slot in Scotland. I want to make it very clear that BBC Alba has widespread support and that STV and I have no problem at all with its occupying that slot. The unfairness here is that, according to the Communications Act 2003, the regulator, Ofcom, should oblige providers of electronic programme guides to give a degree of prominence to public service channels. There are lots of shopping, movie and entertainment channels that could be moved to accommodate local TV, but that has not happened in Scotland. For example, no one could argue that ITV 2 provides a public service, but it is on page 1 of the guide. We have to ask why.</p><p>The answer seems to be clear: Digital UK&#8212;the industry conglomerate that provides the Freeview electronic programme guide&#8212;has the power, but it acts in the interests of the industry&#8217;s biggest players, including ITV and the BBC. Digital UK has a policy that is supposed to favour public service channels, including those that provide local TV, but in Scotland&#8217;s case it has ignored its own guidelines. What is perhaps even more worrying is that the regulator, Ofcom, does not interpret the Communications Act 2003 as giving it the power to demand that public service channels get due prominence, and so refuses to intervene in the matter.</p><p>A solution recently emerged, because the proposal to move BBC 3 online provides an opportunity to promote local TV in Scotland. I recently wrote to Digital UK to ask it to support such a solution, but I was told that the BBC trust has still to make a decision on BBC 3&#8217;s future, so Digital UK will not comment until then. Of course, the BBC is a major player in Digital UK, which controls the electronic programme guide, so I was very worried to read of hints that are coming out of the BBC that it would like to use the vacant slot for BBC 1 +1, which again would stymie local television in Scotland.</p><p>That has exposed a flaw in the legislation that covers the whole UK. If the communications legislation cannot enforce prominence for public service channels in Scotland, there is a danger that public service channels could also lose prominence elsewhere in the UK. The UK Government appears to recognise that and it has announced that it will seek to introduce new legislation to rectify the situation. However, there is no timeline for that legislation and even if it is introduced, it will come too late to benefit the services that are being launched this year in Scotland.</p><p>Of course, the outcome of the referendum could make the debate redundant by transferring regulatory powers over broadcasting from Westminster to this Parliament. However, I am keen to achieve consensus in the debate, so I will not take that point any further. Whatever our position on the constitution, I hope that we can all agree that it is in the interests of democracy for local TV not to be disadvantaged. I therefore hope that we can work together across the chamber for the fairest possible outcome, and not just in the commercial interest of broadcasters but in the interests of building strong communities, enhancing civic engagement and strengthening local democracy.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Television"}, {"date": "2014-05-28", "body": "<p></p><p>6.

I will say more about why I think it is the right time for this debate.</p><p>The Bunchrew land declaration by Community Land Scotland in March this year tells an interesting story, as we have heard. It also tells a story that brings us almost full circle.</p><p>The international human rights community has been debating community land rights for some time now. That debate, to date at least, has been driven by a recognition in many developing countries, where communities have already exercised collective ownership of land and have managed the land sustainably in the interests of the whole community, that those collective rights have had to give way to modern individual property rights.</p><p>In those countries, property rights have often been taken up by large interests wanting to own and extract mineral wealth. In the process they have displaced local communities, dispossessing them of both their land and, importantly, their futures. In an endeavour to start to protect community land rights, the international community has been drawing up guidelines to help encourage countries to take action where communities are losing those collective rights.</p><p>This international story has resonance here in Scotland, and I believe that Scotland has a lot to offer to the debate&#8212;a point that Rhoda Grant made earlier. Many of Scotland&#8217;s crofting communities will relate to the current stories unfolding in the developing world. They have a long history of struggle, and legislative changes from the late 19th century through to the present day have resulted in a succession of legislative reforms and in security of tenure. That serves to protect the interests of their inhabitants and, more widely, their communities. I hope that colleagues across the chamber will agree with me that that reform has made a real difference.</p><p>There have also been rights established for other rural communities throughout Scotland. Some of them&#8212;such as the community right to buy, to which a number of members have referred&#8212;are innovative and can make a real difference to the futures of communities that use them.</p><p>The determination of communities in Scotland to own and manage the land on which they live and work has led to roughly half a million acres of land in community ownership today. In the past year alone, more than 38,000 acres have come under community ownership. There are another 100,000 acres in the pipeline at the moment, which is very encouraging.</p><p>Scotland is not the only country that is working to restore community land rights. Where examples exist, there is growing evidence that community landowners place a far greater emphasis on sustainability and the environment. These really are key drivers to community, as well as national, success and prosperity. New Zealand is another prime example of where that happens.</p><p>I would like Scotland&#8217;s community landowners, with their rich and long experience of rural and community development, to be willing to share their experience internationally, and to help communities in other countries at the start of their struggle.</p><p>I am already aware that the 1 million acre target set by the First Minister in June 2012, which would see us move from around 2 per cent to around 5 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s land coming into community ownership, is being held up as an example in the international debate on community land rights. Therefore, I again thank Rhoda Grant for lodging her motion, record my agreement with the motion and congratulate Community Land Scotland on the publication of the Bunchrew land declaration.</p><p>I made it clear that this Government is committed to progressing land reform in Scotland when I spoke at the Community Land Scotland conference in June and also when I appeared before the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee. I take this opportunity to reiterate that commitment. My vision is for a fairer, wider and more equitable distribution of land in Scotland that provides communities and individuals with the access to land they need to fulfil their aspirations and needs and, in turn, contributes to the sustainable economic development of Scotland and to its social and environmental gains.</p><p>We have a target of 1 million acres, or 5 per cent, of land in community ownership by 2020. It is certainly an ambitious target but it is also a really inspiring one. All Scotland should be engaged in achieving that target. We need communities to think about whether community ownership of land or an asset would make a real difference to their community and its success. We need the public, private, third and community sectors to work together to make sure we get the best from our land.</p><p>The target of 1 million acres in community ownership is sometimes portrayed as pro community and anti private ownership, but that is not the case. As the concentration of ownership decreases there will be room for more community owners and more private owners.</p><p>I agree with Claudia Beamish that it is also clear that land reform in Scotland is not something solely for the Highlands and Islands or for rural Scotland; it is for the whole of Scotland. We need to take land reform into urban areas. There are already numerous examples where community ownership of land has made a real difference in such areas. We want to encourage urban communities and those in our larger rural settlements to become involved and fulfil their potential.</p><p>We also want urban and rural communities to be able to tackle abandoned and neglected land, which is a real hindrance to the sustainable development of land to which communities have a connection. The Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill will propose some key steps that can make a real difference, but further action is needed, which is why I have announced that I will seek to introduce a land reform bill during the current parliamentary session.</p><p>I have said it before&#8212;and other members have referred to this&#8212;that we might not design a system in which 432 landowners, or 0.008 per cent of the population, owns half of the privately owned land in Scotland. That is not to denigrate the individuals who own that land; this is not about the politics of envy. However, we are not aware of any other modern democracy in which such a pattern of land ownership pertains.</p><p>In the time I have left, I will refer to some of the points that have been raised by members. In response to Rhoda Grant, I say that we look to work with Community Land Scotland and others to implement the agenda. Rob Gibson referred to Scotland being a hydro nation. That is an important principle and, to an extent, we all depend on land for our wellbeing, as does the environment.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm talked about the concentration of ownership of forestry. It is true that we have a highly concentrated pattern of forestry ownership, but we are implementing initiatives such as wood lots to explore how communities and individuals can lease forests to manage. Indeed, the Forestry Commission Scotland national forest land scheme is a means by which we can transfer ownership of forests to communities.</p><p>Jean Urquhart made a fair point about the pattern of how the land has been disposed of. We are exploring means by which we can have smaller packets of land for sale. That happened most recently in the sale of Rannoch barracks, which gave opportunities for smaller plots to be bought.</p><p>Alex Fergusson raised a point about community empowerment and I welcome his support for that. I hope that there are aspects of the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill that the Conservatives can support, and we look to work with Alex Fergusson and his colleagues on finding common ground where we can.</p><p>Dave Thompson called for unity with the Opposition parties. I genuinely believe that we can achieve that unity on land reform, and I certainly look forward to working with the Labour Party and others in due course. I agree with Claudia Beamish&#8217;s point about the support systems that HIE produces. They have been very influential in promoting community land projects in the Highlands and Islands.</p><p>My aim is for land reform to address the situation that we face in Scotland by ensuring that patterns of ownership and use of land in this country deliver the maximum benefit to the people of Scotland. I hope&#8212;and I have expressed as much to our stakeholders&#8212;that the land reform review group&#8217;s report has given us the opportunity to take land reform away from the old, polarised arguments and into the 21st century.</p><p>Rhoda Grant is correct to say that we will have many opportunities to debate the issues in due course. The Scottish Government looks forward to working with Parliament and having the support of parliamentary colleagues for the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill and a future land reform bill.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:45.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Bunchrew Land Declaration"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>I advise members that the 2012 Scottish greenhouse gas emissions statistics were published this morning. The data indicate that between 1990 and 2012 Scotland saw a 29.9 per cent reduction in emissions of the basket of six key greenhouse gases. On a comparable basis, using data published today, that contrasts with reductions of 23.9 per cent for England, 17.7 per cent for Wales and 15.0 per cent for Northern Ireland. Over the same period, emissions among all 28 European Union member states fell by 18.5 per cent, and among the EU 15 member states by just 13.9 per cent.</p><p>However, progress towards Scotland&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions targets is formally measured against the level of the net Scottish emissions account. That account incorporates Scotland&#8217;s source emissions; international aviation and international shipping emissions; relevant emissions removals through carbon sinks such as forestry; and the use of emissions allowances by Scottish industries that are participating in the EU emissions trading scheme. Our annual targets were set using the 2008 inventory. At the time, Parliament envisaged that a 24.2 per cent reduction in net emissions should be achieved by 2012 after adjustment for emissions trading. In fact, in 2012, Scotland&#8217;s net greenhouse gas emissions had fallen by 26.4 per cent since 1990. In other words, our emissions trajectory is showing a steeper percentage decline than Parliament expected&#8212;we exceeded the percentage target by 2.2 per cent in 2012.</p><p>Nevertheless, the challenge to Scotland&#8217;s performance is in terms of measurement against fixed, statutory annual targets that are measured in tonnes. In 2012, unadjusted Scottish greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be 52.9 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. That is marginally higher than the 2011 figure of 52.5 mtCO2e but, as I stated earlier, it is 29.9 per cent lower than in 1990. As the Scottish climate change target for 2012 was designed to deliver a specific percentage reduction en route to a 42 per cent decrease by 2020 but was set as a fixed value in tonnes, at 53.226 mtCO2e, Scottish emissions in 2012 exceeded the level required by the annual target that was set under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 by just over 2.4 mtCO2e.</p><p>That must be considered in a context of significant changes in how historical data are calculated as well as new data that combined to add around 5.4 mtCO2e, or a 7.7 per cent increase to the baseline against which all targets were set. That is more than double the amount by which the 2012 target was exceeded. Frustratingly, we have been informed of the changes only now and could not have been aware of them back in 2012. Details of how the data have been updated and improved are set out in the statistical release.</p><p>Our targets are challenging&#8212;that is deliberate&#8212;and year-to-year fluctuations in factors beyond our control are inevitable, but it is worth noting that, if the same percentage reduction of 24.2 per cent that had been envisaged when the 2012 target was set was applied to the updated baseline using the 1990 to 2012 inventory and the annual target was recalibrated accordingly, the benchmark of success would have been 57.3 mtCO2e in 2012. On that basis, we would now be celebrating Scotland&#8217;s emissions being 1.6 mtCO2e below a revised target of 57.3 mtCO2e.</p><p>In the annual progress report on Scotland&#8217;s performance that it published in March, our independent climate change adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, acknowledged that good progress has been made in Scotland on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the energy sector and on energy efficiency. In particular, our record on leading the United Kingdom on renewables&#8212;in 2013, 46.5 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s gross electricity consumption was generated from renewables&#8212;is one that we can be proud of.</p><p>Crucially, the CCC noted that, despite the first two statutory targets having been missed,</p><p>&#8220;underlying progress appears on track in most sectors.&#8221;</p><p>I believe that Scotland&#8217;s Parliament and Scotland&#8217;s people should take heart from that. The trajectory is key. Now that the latest data have been analysed, Parliament can be assured that we are more than halfway towards our interim target of achieving a 42 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020.</p><p>In addition to significant baseline adjustments, an increase in the net Scottish emissions account, which resulted from the operation of the EU ETS, added 2.8 mtCO2e to the 2012 account. That, too, is more than the amount by which the target was exceeded. In 2012, as a result of poor weather, residential emissions increased and energy sector emissions were also affected. That is a regular vulnerability that we are determined to design out through tackling energy efficiency and decarbonising electricity and heat generation.</p><p>There are hard yards ahead. The second report on proposals and policies&#8212;RPP2&#8212;sets the strategic direction for meeting our interim 42 per cent target by 2020 and annual targets to 2027, but section 36 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 requires that, if Scottish ministers lay a report that states that an annual target has not been met, they must, as soon as reasonably practicable, lay before Parliament a report</p><p>&#8220;setting out proposals and policies to compensate in future years for the excess emissions.&#8221;</p><p>I plan to address that by providing an annual report on the 2012 target by the end of October. The current RPP remains relevant and shows that it is possible to meet every annual target. Some policies and proposals will be easier to implement than others. Technology is changing all the time. If individual measures do not work out, we would need to examine alternatives.</p><p>We are also focused on negotiations leading up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change conference of parties in Paris in 2015. As Yeb Sa&#241;o of the Philippines has asked, we need to demonstrate the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to delivery of our stretching targets as our contribution to the necessary global action and to encourage others to higher ambition.</p><p>We have engaged in discussions with Stop Climate Chaos on next steps for several weeks, and I am grateful for the fact that the Opposition parties seem keen to find consensus on new measures that arose from discussions with stakeholders. That positivity offers a hope of maintaining our common purpose as a nation in the face of what is perhaps the greatest global challenge.</p><p>Therefore, I am pleased to announce the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee on climate change to ensure co-ordination of our strategic response at the highest level within Government. The sub-committee will complement the new public sector climate leaders forum and the Scottish Government&#8217;s climate change delivery board. To assist that process, I am making available a monitoring framework for delivery of RPP2 policies and proposals on the Scottish Government website, and I thank the climate change delivery board for its work on that.</p><p>Members can be assured that this Government&#8217;s ambition is resolute. I am confident that our world-leading targets are driving the changes that are required for a smooth transition to a low-carbon Scotland. Scottish ministers remain fully committed to meeting Scotland&#8217;s ambitious greenhouse gas emission targets, and the economic advantages of an early transition are clear. I meet my ministerial colleagues regularly, and I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the significant contributions that they have made to the implementation of the delivery framework that is set out in RPP2.</p><p>For example, through the heat network partnership, the Scottish Government and our agencies will build on the work that underpins the Scottish Government&#8217;s draft heat generation policy statement to commit resources to supporting delivery of district heating projects, and we are actively engaged with projects across Scotland.</p><p>The Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism, Fergus Ewing, has committed to set up a working group under the expert commission on district heating to consider the existing regulatory context and to develop proposals for a regulatory framework. As part of that work, it will investigate how best to ensure that public sector buildings connect to district heating networks, where they are available and when that is cost effective.</p><p>In March, new energy efficiency standards for social housing were launched, and last week my colleague Margaret Burgess announced the final home energy efficiency programmes Scotland&#8212;HEEPS&#8212;allocations of &#163;60 million for 2014-15, which will result in remote local councils receiving &#163;5.3 million more in funding for energy efficiency measures for off-gas-grid homes than in 2013-14.</p><p>We will work with stakeholders to take forward our commitment to target the most fuel-poor areas in the years ahead, including remote rural and hard-to-treat properties.</p><p>On sustainable and active travel, we are committed to achieving our target of almost total decarbonisation of road transport by 2050. This morning, the transport minister announced a further &#163;15 million package for 2014 to 2016, which includes an allocation of an additional &#163;10 million to cycling infrastructure in 2014-15 and funding for more rapid deployment of electric vehicles and associated charging infrastructure throughout Scotland, made up of &#163;7 million for cycling and walking infrastructure, which attracts match funding, &#163;2 million for electric vehicle rapid chargers and &#163;1 million for up to 30 electric vehicles for car clubs.</p><p>The transport minister proposes to allocate &#163;5 million in 2015-16 to develop behavioural change aspects of the smarter choices, smarter places programme. There will be a focus on locally designed initiatives, including travel planning. The approach will be designed to attract local match funding. It is worth noting that the funding of &#163;15 million that is targeted at reducing carbon emissions from the transport sector is 50 per cent more than we had discussed with key stakeholders such as Stop Climate Chaos. That indicates our determination to rise to the challenge.</p><p>On agriculture, we have recently expanded the farming for a better climate programme, and we have worked with Scotland&#8217;s farmers to encourage the mutual benefits from the greening elements of the common agricultural policy. The full detail of the CAP package will be announced by cabinet secretary Richard Lochhead tomorrow.</p><p>It is no doubt because of that package of measures that Stop Climate Chaos Scotland this morning commented that this Government is showing &#8220;serious intent&#8221; in tackling climate change.</p><p>Our climate challenge fund enables communities throughout Scotland to take action, and we support international action on climate justice through our climate justice fund. It does not stop there. Our new cabinet sub-committee and the climate change delivery board will develop policies and financial mechanisms to enable people, organisations and businesses to reduce their emissions while reaping other benefits. Through the public sector climate leaders forum, we have committed the Scottish Government to becoming an exemplar organisation on climate change.</p><p>Climate change is a truly global challenge, and tackling it is a moral imperative.

I support the motion.</p><p>I draw the Parliament&#8217;s attention to the significant progress that has been made, but I make no apology for saying that there is a need for a change in culture if we are to create and exploit opportunities for women. This is not just about women; there is a need for a culture change among men.</p><p>That need is epitomised by the words of the parliamentarian who said that women need to think about what they want to do</p><p>&#8220;as they do the ironing&#8221;.</p><p>The former Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, challenged such remarks by that crusader for freedom and justice, the current Prime Minister of Australia, Oxford-educated Tony Abbott, who is of course connected to the UK Prime Minister through the business relationships of the Prime Minister&#8217;s adviser. If we are in the business of securing freedom and justice and promoting fairness and gender equality, such misogyny has no place in Scotland. We will never seek advice from that source.</p><p>In many areas, women are making a greater contribution, but we can further increase that contribution only when we have full powers over welfare reform and employment law and when we can safeguard human rights in the written constitution of an independent Scotland.</p><p>I make no apology for concentrating on opportunities for women in the field of business and entrepreneurship. Sometimes we arrive at a position as a result of personal experience. In my long experience in business, I have found that women are the best managers and business facilitators, whether they work in customer service, human resources or credit control, or indeed are involved in&#8212;as a woman colleague of mine was&#8212;setting up a subsidiary in Europe. Flexibility is required in such situations, and in my experience women managers invariably outperformed their male counterparts.</p><p>Yesterday morning, I listened to a programme on Radio Scotland about opportunities for women. I heard that women must work 14 more years than men do to achieve the same aggregate income and that women in their 40s earn as much as 40 per cent less than men. The earlier retirement age does not mitigate those circumstances.</p><p>During the programme, a comparison was drawn between men&#8217;s ambitions and women&#8217;s ambitions. It appears that&#8212;and perhaps this is unsurprising&#8212;men put a higher salary and better benefits as their number 1 priority, whereas women&#8217;s work priorities are location, sociability and flexibility.</p><p>If we are to secure opportunities for women and secure fairness and equality, as I am sure we all want to do, we need a seismic culture change, not least in the context of the man&#8217;s role in the family. My stepson has been raising our twin granddaughters in the family home while his wife carries out an important international function&#8212;they live in Singapore, happily. Flexibility, fairness and equality of opportunity are paramount.</p><p>Research by the Hunter centre for entrepreneurship shows that increasing the number of women entrepreneurs to match the number of men would generate an extra &#163;7.6 billion for the Scottish economy. That is not a small amount.</p><p>However, when we talk about setting targets such as 40 per cent female participation on boards or an equal number of women entrepreneurs, I caution against the perception that it is the norm for alpha males to take up such roles. At this morning&#8217;s meeting of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, members reflected on the great success of Edinburgh&#8217;s festivals with a panel of witnesses that was 80 per cent female. Those women were the chair of the Edinburgh&#8217;s festivals forum; the director of Festivals Edinburgh; the chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society; and a senior adviser at Creative New Zealand. They deserved to be there because the festival is, as we know, a jewel in the Scottish branding crown.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s role is critical in establishing a level playing field for women in entrepreneurship, in establishing the women in enterprise network and in providing financial support for the women&#8217;s enterprise ambassadors and the investing women initiative. Those are stepping stones to that level playing field, as will be the outcomes of the working together review and the developing Scotland&#8217;s young workforce commission.</p><p>The culture among men must also change, so that we work towards the creation and promotion of opportunities for women&#8212;and, indeed, for men&#8212;and a wider sense of value and overall remuneration, based on merit and contribution, in more flexible working environments.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>Will the member give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>Will the member take an intervention?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>Will the member give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p>Will the cabinet secretary give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Increasing Opportunities for Women"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>Can the minister give a view on the opportunities that exist for the exploitation of oil and gas reserves off the west coast of Scotland in the North Channel, in the Firth of Clyde and west of Hebrides?

The retail sector as a whole employs 255,000 people, and 41,000 people are employed in convenience stores. It is a large private sector employer that employs 14 per cent of the non-Government workforce.</p><p>Our retailers have had a difficult few years with the recession. Sales volumes in small and medium-sized retail businesses&#8212;and particularly independent convenience stores&#8212;declined from 2008 to the first half of 2012, although limited growth has occurred since 2012. On a wider scale, I believe that the feedthrough and leakage of spending from the recent successful Commonwealth games have been reflected in a change in footfall figures and in the flow of business that embraces small, independent operations.</p><p>I praise the retail sector&#8217;s efforts to tempt shoppers with not just keen prices and promotions but best value, customer service and quality. The challenge is to maintain growth and gain long-term benefits. In the past few years, another challenge to convenience stores has been from out-of-town supermarket developments. However, I have been told in discussions with Leigh Sparks that the supermarkets seem to be reappraising their investment strategies and that they are looking at town centre investment, which would provide the independents with new challenges to confront.</p><p>The Scottish Government has recognised the importance of our retailers in its town centre review, which included sector experts from all over the country and representatives of smaller independent units. The review looked at sharing resources and services, developing creativity in enterprise and contributing generally to the health of our town centres. All that is key.</p><p>The review said that the Scottish Government and local authorities need to recognise and prioritise the importance of town centres for sustainable economic growth. The lifeblood of that flows naturally from independent convenience stores.</p><p>We need to ensure that all dimensions of the retail sector are seen to offer a good career path. To achieve that, we must work with all the skills development providers&#8212;our colleges and our employers&#8212;to secure the aspiration for those who would like to be involved in retail. We could start at the bottom by working with independent convenience stores on the creation of appropriate apprenticeships.</p><p>Our independent retailers play a vital role in the success of our high streets.

That same day, in the evening, I hosted a reception on crowd funding, where we learned that the participation of small investors and clients in that process means that Edinburgh and Glasgow are now hot on the heels of London. Both situations, among many others, demonstrate the wielding of economic strength and power and the opportunities that arise from the people and the grass roots.</p><p>As has been mentioned, the chief economist&#8217;s report last week highlighted the strengthening of the Scottish economy, as did the Bank of Scotland report yesterday. Because of the stewardship of the finances, 2014 will be the strongest year of growth since 2007, despite the constraints of budgets. However, we can still&#8212;and we must&#8212;do more to achieve a fairer, more equal and more participative Scotland when it comes to jobs and incomes.</p><p>Great though the increasing economic contribution of the grass roots is, larger companies, be they in life sciences, renewable energy, manufacturing or tourism, combine to confront the myths that are proposed to dispel Scotland&#8217;s great economic opportunities.</p><p>The first myth is on currency. I will deal with it briefly. In 2013, Scotland was recognised by authoritative financial sources as potentially one of the richest countries in the world. In that year, Scotland had a trade surplus of &#163;2.8 billion and the rest of the UK had a trade deficit of &#163;29.5 billion. Over the past 30 years, Scotland&#8217;s average net fiscal balance has consistently been better than that of the rest of the UK, as has its current budget balance. A refusal to do a deal on sterling union would be just one contributory factor to the decline of sterling for the rest of the UK.</p><p>I turn to the second myth. As Maureen Watt mentioned, oil and gas is of course a significant contributor to Scotland&#8217;s economic opportunities. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury keeps chanting his mantra that oil is declining, so let us turn the question around. If that is the case, it will, in the unlikely event of a no vote, then apply to a continuing UK Government. In 2011-12 UK net borrowings were &#163;120 billion, or &#163;131.5 billion if we strip out Scotland&#8217;s offshore contribution. In 2011-12 the figure was &#163;149 billion, and in 2009-10 it was &#163;164 billion, applying the same criteria. That scenario may be unlikely, but in the face of the myth of declining oil those parties should tell us where they would make savage cuts or increase taxes to shore up the currency and to decimate the debt.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>No&#8212;I cannot just now.</p><p>We certainly know where those cuts would fall, and it would not be on the bankers&#8217; bonuses.</p><p>Of course, UK ministers know that oil is not declining: witness Mr Cameron&#8217;s clandestine visit to the vast Clair ridge oilfield just two weeks ago, the exploration off Tiree and the cover-up of oil production&#8212;I stress the word &#8220;production&#8221;&#8212;30 years ago under production licence PL262 in the lower Clyde and Atlantic margins, in the early 1980s. That cover-up has been acknowledged by Michael Heseltine.</p><p>The UK Government continues to perpetuate those myths and others because it knows that Scotland&#8217;s contribution from food and drink, general exports and oil is required to reduce UK borrowings in an attempt to balance its books.</p><p>With the rest of the UK being without Scotland and then pulling out of Europe, I will encourage my children, along with other young people who sought jobs in London and the south-east, to consider coming home, and those who are being trained and skilled here to stay home. We have an opportunity to build a solid Scottish economy based on the economic strategy, which embraces the strong sectors that I have mentioned, and that will allow us to increase our working population and compete on employment and productivity. Young people, more apprenticeships, skills development and a situation in which more women are in management and in the workplace will underpin the economic strategy.</p><p>During the recess, I had the opportunity to meet innovators and businesspeople from China, Norway and elsewhere who are attracted to invest in Scotland because they see and sense the economic opportunities that exist here.

The issue has certainly been very important to the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee. I believe that that support has allowed us to move forward and address the concerning decline in pollinator numbers that is being highlighted today. Indeed, as Angus MacDonald said, the Scottish Parliament has taken steps in our own backyard, as it might be called, to promote the importance of pollinators through the new bee hives.</p><p>In my own South Scotland region, as in other parts of Scotland, there are a number of reserves that play an important role in conserving pollinator populations. The Falls of Clyde, Garrion Gill and the Upper Nethan gorge all contain essential grassland areas that host many of Scotland&#8217;s most productive pollinators, including various species of bees and butterflies. Such pollinator-friendly environments should act as prime examples of what communities and farmers can do to preserve pollinator numbers and improve biodiversity in general. As we heard, there are also some examples in urban environments, such as the Jupiter project to which Angus MacDonald referred. We can all make a difference individually. As MSPs we can encourage our constituents to do that by planting in gardens of whatever size and even in window boxes.</p><p>Of course, we are all aware of the huge contribution that pollinators make to Scotland as a whole. Those insects play a central role in crop production, as Alison Johnstone said, contributing roughly &#163;43 million to the economy, as well as helping Scotland&#8217;s rich ecosystems to flourish. However, as pointed out in Angus MacDonald&#8217;s motion, that vital role is being put in danger. There has been as much as a 65 per cent decrease in certain pollinator populations over recent decades. I am sure that members will agree that we all have a responsibility to do something about that.</p><p>A large factor in the decline of pollinator numbers is of course the overuse of pesticides. The Scottish Wildlife Trust in particular has been campaigning for a moratorium on neonics so that the evidence base regarding their impact can be built up. As we have heard, that view has been taken on board by the EU, which has recently imposed a two-year ban&#8212;but only on three types of neonicotinoid. Of course, pesticides are used for a reason, but it is important that they are used in a sustainable manner and only when required, rather than being applied to seeds before they are planted.</p><p>We must identify alternative methods of protecting crops from pests through an integrated pest management plan. That is now an obligation on EU member states; perhaps the minister will be able to provide us with details of how the Scottish Government is addressing that obligation. Can she also indicate whether there are plans to have a ban in Scotland on neonicotinoids, given the risk of the ban in the EU being only temporary and ceasing to exist after 2015? We heard from Angus MacDonald about research that the Scottish Government has already done, and it would be very helpful if the minister could let us know what research is going on in Scotland.</p><p>The minister will be aware that the Scottish Wildlife Trust has made suggestions on how to protect pollinators within the common agricultural policy, including providing funds for farmers to provide ecosystem services. I believe that those suggestions merit further consideration.</p><p>I hope that the debate will help to draw attention to the importance of pollinators and the contribution that they make not only to our economy but to the vibrant and wonderful colours of all types of habitats in Scotland. I believe that we must all contribute to making the situation better for the pollinators&#8217; habitats.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Pollinator Population"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I thank Drew Smith for getting the debate so quickly and I strongly support the motion, which I discussed with him before its drafting.</p><p>I declare an interest as a co-convener of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on Palestine, where we all work together in any small way that we can.

Only last week, research into trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and coping strategies among Palestinian adolescents was written about in The Arab Journal of Psychiatry. Is it any wonder that, facing with others in Gaza the shocking imprisonment in the most densely populated place in the world and the deplorable cycle of violence and coping against the odds from day to day in between assaults, many people&#8212;young people, in particular&#8212;become radicalised?</p><p>The lifting of the blockade must be an essential part of negotiations.

He stressed to the world&#8217;s press who were assembled to listen to us in Gaza in 2012 that Hamas must be part of the negotiations. I am sure that he is right.</p><p>I hope that we can send a collective message from the Parliament. A political solution that involves a Palestinian state while ensuring Israel&#8217;s own citizens&#8217; security is the only solution that will hold firm and bring a chance of life and hope to the children and young people of Gaza and of the Palestinian exiles around the world.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-08-05", "body": "<p>I want to support all that Rhoda Grant has said in opening the debate. The land ownership question is fundamental to a fairer Scotland. It sometimes still feels as though the land debate is just a Highlands and Islands thing, but the question of land reform has relevance to South Scotland, the region that I and the minister represent.</p><p>We have much to learn from the Highlands and Islands and seek to involve more and more communities in the real future of their land. The fact that the Highlands and Islands has had Highlands and Islands Enterprise as an economic and social development agency for close to 50 years shows in the capacity of its communities, but also in the support systems that are in place. I hope that the minister will agree that, within Scotland, there is more that we can do to share best practice. I have to disagree with Alex Fergusson, and I ask the minister to agree that the new agencies that are proposed, or similar models, will offer local communities support and are not about centralisation.</p><p>However, tonight I want to focus principally on matters that originate beyond Scotland&#8217;s shores but which are relevant here and can give us strength and confidence in our policy actions. I am not referring to human rights considerations. I want to concentrate on one particular international agreement, which was signed up to by the current UK Government.</p><p>I confess that I did not know about the existence of a document called, &#8220;Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security&#8221; until attention was drawn to it by Community Land Scotland in the Bunchrew land declaration. It is a United Nations food and agriculture organisation policy document that was agreed by the UN&#8217;s committee on world food security and has since been endorsed by the G8. The guidelines have high-level international endorsement and they apply to all member states, not just developing countries. The guidance is designed to</p><p>&#8220;improve tenure governance by providing guidance and information on internationally accepted practices for systems that deal with the rights to use, manage and control land&#8221;.</p><p>They are about internationally accepted practices and are now recommended for consideration by nation states in the development of land policies.</p><p>The guidelines are voluntary but they carry the weight of official endorsement at the most senior international levels. They set out helpful policy principles and cover Government-owned land as well as other ownerships. Other members have highlighted that issue.</p><p>On Government land, it states:</p><p>&#8220;Where States own or control land, fisheries and forests, they should determine the use and control of these resources in light of broader social, economic and environmental objectives.&#8221;</p><p>That resonates with ideas about sustainable development in the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 and proposals to update the act in the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill. I feel passionate about sustainable development because it is defined in economic, social and environmental terms.</p><p>The guidance makes it clear that redistributive reforms</p><p>&#8220;can facilitate broad and equitable access to land and inclusive rural development&#8221;</p><p>and that</p><p>&#8220;States may consider land ceilings as a policy option in the context of ... redistributive reforms.&#8221;</p><p>So, as the Bunchrew land declaration suggests, the apparently controversial policy idea of ceilings on land holdings is legitimised through these international guidelines, which are approved by the UK Government.</p><p>However, having a ceiling is only one potential redistributive mechanism; there are many others. The guidelines make it clear that</p><p>&#8220;redistributive reforms may be considered for social, economic and environmental reasons ... where a high degree of ownership concentration is combined with ... rural poverty attributable to lack of access to land, fisheries and forests&#8221;.</p><p>I have been able to describe only briefly the depth of the policy practices that are internationally endorsed in the document. The voluntary guidelines are worthy of more study. I hope that the minister will consider that in his closing remarks. We should feel strengthened by this as we move forward to take what some may regard as radical steps, but which I and many&#8212;if not most&#8212;in this chamber believe are important steps in land reform for the future communities of Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Bunchrew Land Declaration"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>Amendment 7 seeks to allow the Scottish ministers to create regulations on energy efficiency standards, which would be included as part of the repairing standard in the private rented sector. It would also establish a system of inspection and enforcement.</p><p>As she highlighted, the minister put forward reasons for not supporting my amendment at stage 2. I intend to address the amendment, even though those remarks have already been made.</p><p>First, it was highlighted today that the minister felt that including the provision in the bill was unnecessary because the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 provides powers to introduce minimum standards of energy efficiency. Although that is the case, I still argue that the phraseology of section 64 of the 2009 act is different and less focused than what I suggest. It requires ministers to set regulations to provide for the assessment of energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions and requires owners to take steps to improve the accommodation. That may or may not be realised through minimum standards, which is what I propose. In addition, it does not specifically address the standards where a house forms only part of a premises, which my amendment does.</p><p>Another argument that the minister put forward against the amendment was that a working group is already tasked with reporting back on measures to improve energy efficiency in the domestic housing sector. Again, I support the reasoning behind the setting up of such a group and wish it well, but there are energy efficiency measures that my amendment highlights that would be best placed in the bill among the provisions that relate to the repairing standard. Organisations such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the City of Edinburgh Council and Friends of the Earth Scotland agree with that approach.</p><p>Others may disagree and would like to wait for some as yet not defined piece of legislation in the future. If and when that legislation comes before the chamber, there is no reason why it cannot refer to the amendment to the bill. I see no reason to wait and to actively oppose amendment 7. Tenants are suffering from fuel poverty in multi-ownership houses, and it is important that that is addressed now.</p><p>The final criticism that the minister put forward at stage 2 related to the timescale. As she has acknowledged today, I have altered the timescale. That should help the possibility of amendment 7 being accepted and the regulations being taken forward.

The opportunities to further develop rail travel to mainland Europe should also be considered.</p><p>Of course no one is saying that all air travel should be discouraged. Most non-domestic journeys, especially intercontinental ones, require air travel, but the proliferation of intercity flights in the UK could be tackled by making the case for more rail travel. That said, no one has yet acknowledged the importance of the exemption from APD for the Western Isles, to some parts of which it would not be realistic to travel using means other than air travel.</p><p>I hope that members agree that it is fair and sensible to consider connectivity in the round.

First, the local community council saw a small piece of woodland&#8212;Ponfeigh glen&#8212;as being inappropriately threatened by opencast mining. An SWT ranger, David Wilson, advised on how our concerns fitted with planning policy, about which I did not have a clue, frankly. That enabled us to submit an objection to South Lanarkshire Council. As we heard from John Wilson, the SWT&#8217;s input into the planning process has come on in leaps and bounds, and there is support across much of Scotland for volunteers who want to look at the planning process.</p><p>Secondly, SWT advice from the falls of Clyde ranger, John Darbyshire, helped us to change a dreadful fly-tipping site at Loudon pond on Douglas Water into a community nature reserve of some significance.</p><p>Such SWT advice for conservation volunteers over the years is one of the reasons why there are 1,153 local biodiversity sites across the south today.</p><p>One of the 33 South Scotland SWT reserves is, of course, the Falls of Clyde, which stretches along both sides of the dangerous Clyde gorge. The boardwalk that I opened this year has done much to help to make that safer. I have had the delight of visiting the reserve with my family over many years. When my children were small, we experienced the thrill of seeing badgers snuffling out of their setts at dusk. As the children became old enough to hold binoculars, we caught a glimpse of the peregrines nesting in the crevices across the Clyde, which are well protected round the clock by the peregrine watch volunteers. Alternatively, we simply absorbed the tranquil atmosphere along the walkway in the dappled sunlight and left the reserve refreshed. Since I had the honour of opening the new visitor centre earlier this year, there have been 20,000 visits to it; a further 50,000 people have visited the reserve itself.</p><p>The importance of SWT species projects also cannot be overestimated.

The trust could not operate without the contribution of volunteers and it is right that we thank them again today, as part of the 50-year celebrations.</p><p>At a strategic level, Europe-wide and Scottish biodiversity targets have been missed, and I know that the minister will agree with me that that must not be found to have happened again in 2020. The SWT makes a significant contribution to Scotland&#8217;s biodiversity. I was especially pleased to see the conservation progress made by the SWT in all its sites, with 99 per cent of SWT sites of special scientific interest being in &#8220;favourable&#8221; or &#8220;unfavourable but recovering&#8221; condition, which is much better than what is being achieved across the SSSI range.</p><p>I hope that we can count on continued financial support for the SWT.

It has been acknowledged across the chamber that the United Kingdom and Scotland have played their part in ensuring that those who seek solace are granted respite in our country.</p><p>On a human level, individuals in our communities and communities themselves have often shown by example the support that they can offer to those who arrive on our doorstep in dire need. We have seen some great examples of the support that has been offered. Unfortunately, as I go round doorsteps in the south of Scotland, I meet resistance to that approach. Some people say that they fear that asylum seekers and refugees get better treatment, and some allege that they have been used as cheap labour, which has resulted in unemployment in an area or a fall in wage rates. That is the type of misinformation that some political parties utilise to create fear and jealousy in our communities.</p><p>The major task that the minister and his Government face is that of ensuring that accurate information is provided to our communities so that the kind of information that passes as fact and which, for some people, eventually becomes accepted wisdom is rejected. Such misinformation does no service to Scotland, and it makes much harder the task of ensuring that those who seek asylum in our country or to be acknowledged as refugees are able to do so. It also makes it difficult for the authorities and others to deliver on behalf of those people, who need so much from us.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers and Refugees"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>I am grateful to Dennis Robertson for that intervention. I acknowledge the part that the media can play, but that only strengthens my argument that the Government needs to ensure that the facts are put into the public domain repeatedly&#8212;ad nauseam&#8212;so that we understand exactly what is happening in our various communities.</p><p>In that context, I commend the work of the Scottish Refugee Council, COSLA, the third sector, individuals across our communities and communities themselves for the work that they are doing to improve the nature of the reception that we offer asylum seekers and refugees in our country and the assistance that they receive on the stages that will lead, one would hope, to productive residence.</p><p>The &#8220;New Scots&#8221; report is to be welcomed and, in that regard, Scottish Labour supports the Government&#8217;s motion. We also support the amendment from the Lib Dems.</p><p>On an institutional basis, it has been indicated that successive Scottish Governments have provided &#163;13.5 million to aid the integration of asylum seekers and refugees into our communities. In all truth, that is a modest sum of money over a 13-year period. No doubt the award of &#163;2 million from the Big Lottery Fund to the Scottish Refugee Council will be a welcome benefit that will enable it to do the work that it delivers on our behalf.</p><p>It is well recognised that, as the minister said in his speech, generations of asylum seekers have benefited Scotland throughout the ages. There is no doubt that there are still great difficulties for asylum seekers coming here to attain refugee status, from the 28-day timeframe to move asylum seekers into mainstream accommodation and from the ability of the universal credit system to deliver financial support.</p><p>There are a number of questions for the minister. Can he assure us that some clarity of information will be forthcoming? Will he obtain accurate numbers, which are absent from the &#8220;New Scots&#8221; report, in terms of asylum seekers and those who are refugees in our country in order that we know what we are dealing with? Will he commit to ensuring that none of those categories of people will be taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers who would seek to take advantage of those people&#8217;s weakness?</p><p>The minister referred to the card system that is utilised. That system was brought into disrepute many decades ago when it was used for social security. It placed those who needed to use the cards in a very weak situation at a point when they were vulnerable, and the cards&#8217; value was often discounted by unscrupulous shopkeepers who would not offer what was necessary. Evidence of that should be produced and utilised in order that we can get rid of the cards.</p><p>It would be helpful to know the numbers of employers who have been reported for taking advantage of those in the asylum and refugee community and the number of gangmasters who have been convicted in Scotland in that connection. I would support any commitment that the Government offers to local authorities, particularly Glasgow City Council, which we need to acknowledge has led the way in offering support in some very difficult circumstances.</p><p>I support the motion and the Lib Dems&#8217; amendment.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers and Refugees"}, {"date": "2014-06-12", "body": "<p>Scottish Labour supports the message that the profits that are created by criminal conduct across Scotland should be seized and returned to the communities from which they were stolen in the first place. That is why, at the United Kingdom level, Labour supported the introduction of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and was fully committed to the various developments that have led to where we are today. However, it is apposite that we take time now to discuss whether cashback delivers effectively and in a way that we would seek for the future. In that context, I am very pleased to contribute to the debate.</p><p>The cabinet secretary indicated in response to an intervention that he did not have specific figures to justify his some of his claims of success in connection with the cashback formula. Repeated freedom of information requests relating to the successes and outcomes that the cashback programme has delivered have been very difficult to pursue through the system, and responses have been delayed and obscure, describing as successes what we would all like to laud in the future. Although we support the underlying measures that the Government has introduced, we would like to see a sharpening of focus to ensure that moneys that are recovered from criminals are directed with best effect to those who might benefit from cashback.</p><p>I hope that the cabinet secretary can agree that we support a major part of the Government&#8217;s motion. He mentioned that the scheme is unique, but I remind him that, in 2006, the then Labour Administration had a very similar scheme with the engaging title of the reinvesting the proceeds of crime scheme. It was described as support for</p><p>&#8220;local projects aimed at reducing crime, improving people&#8217;s quality of life and visibly repairing the harm caused to communities through the impact of serious violent crime.&#8221;</p><p>Therefore, on the notion that cashback is an innovative scheme that the Government introduced, it would perhaps have been more humane to acknowledge that it is a development of an earlier edition of a similar scheme that was led by the then Minister for Justice, Cathy Jamieson.</p><p>When that scheme was introduced, there were discussions across the UK about how such assets might be used. England and Wales took an approach that was very different from the approach in Scotland. They agreed that moneys that had been liberated from criminal sources could be filtered through to the police service, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs and even the prosecution authorities. I can tell the cabinet secretary from first-hand experience of that process that a great deal of professional time and budget attention was spent trying to ensure that each of those agencies got its fair share of the assets that were recovered from criminals. The approach that was taken in Scotland&#8212;I am pleased that the current Government followed it through&#8212;instead looked to direct assets that were recovered from criminals to the communities that they initially came from. To that extent, cashback has delivered, and we are keen to continue to support that delivery. It would be good if the Government acknowledged that it has the support of members on the Opposition benches.</p><p>However, we want to see where the money goes and what the public and communities get from the delivery of cashback. The Scottish Football Association and the communities cup get &#163;7.1 million over five years, but the routes out of prison project gets &#163;500,000. Scottish rugby gets &#163;3.6 million, whereas the just play programme gets &#163;310,000. International development was given &#163;1.5 million, and the Procurator Fiscal Service and the police were given &#163;3 million. From my perspective, it is difficult to ascertain what benefits have actually accrued. That is the important point.</p><p>We can see the activities and we know the numbers who have engaged, but we need to understand whether the investment achieved the best outcome, so that we can review that and share it with the Scottish public.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Cashback for Communities"}, {"date": "2014-06-12", "body": "<p>I said that we welcome the investment in such activities.

We would like greater rigour on the cabinet secretary&#8217;s part in stretching his officials to ensure that such evidence is gathered where it exists, so that we can judge in the future where to disburse funds across Scotland.</p><p>I bring to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s attention a recent change that seems to have taken place in some of the policies that attach to recovered assets. With some difficulty, I accessed correspondence that indicates that some proceeds of crime funding is to be allocated to Police Scotland and that,</p><p>&#8220;wherever possible, the receipts are&#8221;</p><p>to be</p><p>&#8220;allocated to operational policing activities within local communities, and for maximising future recoveries in line with the principles agreed by the Serious Organised Task Force ... meeting held on 10th February&#8221;.</p><p>The problem is that we cannot access the minutes of that meeting to know what those principles are. However, the Scottish Police Authority acknowledges the inclusion of estimates of expected receipts in its 2014-15 and 2015-16 budgets.</p><p>Some recovered assets will not go back directly to communities; they will supplement the work of the police and prosecution authorities. Allocating money in that way will change the behaviour of those services in pursuing receipts in the future.</p><p>On the face of it, that might seem to be a laudable outcome&#8212;I see Bruce Crawford nodding. Unfortunately, having spoken to many professionals in England and Wales, I know that the experience there indicates that people will pursue work that is more attentive to maximising their receipts rather than receipts for the common good.

The scheme must be preserved and protected from those who would abuse it. Each time a blue badge is misused on a car that is parked in an area where only those who hold valid blue badges are allowed to park, genuine blue badge users are denied use of a space. That is particularly problematic in city centres, where parking charges can be quite prohibitive and have led to people abusing blue badges to try to park on the cheap. According to an officer from the City of Edinburgh Council:</p><p>&#8220;between 52 and 70 percent of all badges that are on display will be being misused.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 26 March 2014; c 3278.]</p><p>That is a staggering figure, although I understand that there are some&#8212;Inclusion Scotland, for example&#8212;who have reservations over the veracity of that claim. Nonetheless, badges are being abused and that must be tackled.</p><p>During stage 2, John Wilson lodged a number of amendments on behalf of Inclusion Scotland, due to some concerns over the bill that they shared. I had some sympathy with John Wilson&#8217;s amendment 1, which sought to limit the power of confiscation so that only non-valid badges could be confiscated. Like other members, I worry that eligible badge holders might have their badges confiscated due to the actions of third parties and then be left to face the consequences. I accept that the power is important if we are to discourage abuse and free up spaces for people who genuinely need them, but I do not want people who desperately need their badges to go without them for any length of time.</p><p>I was satisfied with the reassurance that was given to the committee that valid badges will be returned to holders within 14 days of confiscation, along with an explanatory letter that reminds the holder of their responsibilities. That approach is proportionate. However, I expect the Scottish Government to monitor whether holders routinely get their badges back within two weeks.</p><p>Given that a new strict liability offence will be created, it will be important for all badge holders to be aware of their responsibilities, to ensure that they do not inadvertently misuse their badges. The booklet that is currently distributed to holders is certainly a bit clunky, as Scottish Government officials acknowledged when they gave evidence, so I welcome officials&#8217; work to produce a more appropriate document.</p><p>I welcome the good progress that the blue badge reform working group is making towards developing a code of practice.

That is little wonder when one considers that, since March 2007, more than 11,000 properties have been lost from social renting housing stock and the ever-increasing length of waiting lists has driven people towards the private sector.</p><p>It is long since time that we ensured that standards in the sector were improved, and I reiterate my support for the regulation of letting agents; the introduction of a tribunal system; the inclusion of basic safety measures; and the scrapping of the right to buy.

I felt that it was important to reintroduce the amendment at stage 3, but&#8212;as I said earlier&#8212;I am satisfied, after discussions on the issue with the minister and Homeless Action Scotland, and following the minister&#8217;s positive words earlier in today&#8217;s proceedings, that the matter is now in hand and that a satisfactory conclusion has been reached.

The new duty that was set out in the amendment was so significant that it could not have been reasonably introduced without the sector having the opportunity to comment on it first or, for that matter, without full parliamentary scrutiny.

Sadly, older people are being let down by the Government&#8217;s confused priorities.

The Scottish Government is cutting the number of beds drastically without improving social care and support, which only puts more pressure on an NHS that is already being asked to do more and more. The SNP&#8217;s short-term approach to the stewardship of our NHS could have a long-term negative impact on patient care.

However, we can hardly be shocked at that figure, as the capital housing budget was cut by 29 per cent between 2008-09 and 2011-12.

However, we would have preferred, in line with the recommendation of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee and the majority of those who gave evidence to it, for the right to buy to be abolished one year, rather than two years, from the date of royal assent.</p><p>Protecting social housing does not stop at ending the right to buy. Ensuring that everyone has a right to social housing that is suitable for their needs remains a priority for Scottish Labour. That is why we wanted the amendment on sustainable communities. With such an approach, we can consider sustainability by matching tenants to homes and, we hope, build long-lasting communities. Living in sustainable communities benefits everyone. Our local authorities and housing associations, working with community groups, know best what their communities need. Working to make sure that people can sustain their tenancy and tackle antisocial behaviour is a priority for Labour.</p><p>Part 3 of the bill, on the transfer of power to the first-tier tribunal, is a practical move. Sheriff courts across Scotland are struggling to support criminal justice proceedings, and it is a step in the right direction to take housing-related issues out of those courts. However, careful monitoring is required to ensure that tribunals remain fair and representative.</p><p>On the private rented sector, James Kelly proposed amendments on rent reviews and increases in tenancy lengths that would have improved the bill. Indeed, the SNP&#8217;s expert working group on welfare said in relation to the private rented sector:</p><p>&#8220;This means looking at the nature of tenancies, for example, giving tenants in the private sector longer-term tenancies than generally exist at present, as well as building into tenancy agreements that rents should increase in line with inflation but not above it&#8221;.</p><p>Another feature of the bill is the registration of letting agents.

One of those barriers is the current public entertainment licensing regime, which stems from the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. The 32 local authorities have taken what has been called a scatter-gun approach to fees and to the interpretation of the 1982 act. Some councils charge for temporary licences; some charge for a full year. Some of them charge per ride; some charge by size. Many of the conditions are unnecessary and disproportionate.</p><p>My local authority, Renfrewshire, charges &#163;812, which is the highest in Scotland.

That is not to mention the 13 per cent of the &#163;1.1&#160;billion funding that our institutions received from UK charities which, again, is an above-average figure.</p><p>The cabinet secretary also mentioned attracting international investment.

Orkney has a great many historical sites and experts, and our worthwhile and helpful visit raised a number of questions and issues. For example, we heard confusion from stakeholders about the exact division of responsibilities in the roles that historic environment Scotland, Marine Scotland and Scottish ministers will play in relation to the marine environment. As the committee report states, it appears that decision making on submerged archaeological sites sits with Marine Scotland rather than with historic environment Scotland, yet the historic environment strategy is to encompass sites under water. I am sure that we would all welcome clarity from the cabinet secretary on that.</p><p>During our Orkney visit, the issue of local decision making was also raised, as other members have said. Local groups highlighted the need to guard against centralised decision making on the historic environment.

We also stress our belief that the Scottish Government could also be doing more to attract international students.</p><p>Much of the motion concerns the damaging effect of the Tory-led UK Government&#8217;s immigration policies on universities. I do not disagree, but it would be extremely naive to think that only our universities are facing the challenge. I share the view of Mary Senior, of the University and College Union Scotland, who told the Education and Culture Committee:</p><p>&#8220;The UK Government&#8217;s immigration policy is holding back not only universities in Scotland but universities right across the UK.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 25 March 2014; c 3857.]</p><p>The Labour Party acknowledges the huge contribution that immigrants have made to Scotland and the UK over many decades and the contribution that immigrants continue to make to our universities and colleges. I mention colleges deliberately, because the Scottish Government has again ignored further education in its motion.</p><p>The Colleges Scotland briefing for the debate highlights a significant drop in the number of foreign students at our colleges. Given that the Scottish Government has overseen a staggering cut of 140,000 in the number of students going to college in Scotland&#8212;from anywhere&#8212;that should not come as a surprise. The trend needs to be urgently addressed; the Scottish Government is responsible for that trend.</p><p>It is precisely because the Labour Party recognises the positive contribution that international students make to our education system and communities that First Minister Jack McConnell&#8217;s Administration introduced the fresh talent initiative in 2004. Fresh talent was a bespoke programme, which was designed to address the biggest challenge that faced Scotland&#8212;a declining population. Central to the initiative was the plan to allow overseas graduates from Scottish universities who expressed an intention to live and work in Scotland to stay on for two years following the completion of their course, to seek employment.</p><p>It is important to recognise that the Scottish Executive was required to work to secure the powers to take such an approach in a devolved Parliament.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Immigration Policy (Higher Education)"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>It would surprise the minister a great deal if I agreed that we should become independent and have our own immigration policy.

What is more, the fresh talent working in Scotland scheme, which was announced in February 2004, was operating by the following summer and covered students who graduated that year.</p><p>Labour members are proud that we took that approach in 2004. We are proud that we secured the agreements that were needed to make it happen as quickly as it did in 2005. In 2008, as the minister said, the scheme was taken over by a UK-wide scheme which looked to engage with immigrants in a positive way.</p><p>Our connection with the fresh talent initiative and commitment to encouraging international students to help Scotland to flourish is all the more reason to disagree with the changes that the coalition Government has made. However, our success in creating the fresh talent initiative shows that we can tackle the issue if we use the force of political will and creative policies.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Immigration Policy (Higher Education)"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>No, and I will give the reason for that&#8212;[Interruption]&#8212;if members care to listen.</p><p>The First Minister was talking about the national health service in Wales today. Perhaps the Scottish Government should consider what lessons can be learned from Wales when it comes to attracting international students. In Wales, where Labour is in power, the proportion of international postgraduates is the largest in the UK, at 41 per cent&#8212;the proportion is 36 per cent in Scotland.</p><p>After the coalition Government ended the fresh talent initiative in 2010-11, many people expected to see a drop in overseas students coming to study here. However, the figures show that in the following year, 2011-12, the number of international students rose by 2 per cent, from 27,880 to 28,500. I accept that we need to look at the figures in detail, as the minister said, because the levels from different countries vary.</p><p>In doing so, we must acknowledge, as the Tory amendment does, that the student visa system has been open to abuse in some circumstances, so we need to look closely at temporary student visas for short courses to see whether they are being abused. Labour accepts that and I know that it is in the Conservative amendment. I am sure that all parties would agree with that.</p><p>The SNP wants to use the debate to talk about the coalition Government&#8217;s immigration policy as if it is a threat to the future of our higher education system. As proud as I am of Labour&#8217;s delivery of the very system that has been rolled back, the numbers show that overseas students continue to come here to study. Indeed, the numbers continued to increase after the change to the system. So, although I disagree with the Con-Dem Government&#8217;s policies, that is what the statistics show.</p><p>We fear that those policies could be damaging over time, but the reality is that independence is the biggest threat to higher education in Scotland. Just two weeks ago, I spoke in the debate on the life sciences and highlighted the benefits to Scotland of a single research system across the UK. The funding system gives a disproportionate level of research funding to our excellent universities. The facts speak for themselves. In 2012-13, Scottish higher education institutions secured &#163;257 million of UK research council grants. That represents 13.1 per cent of the UK total, which is significantly more than our 8 per cent of UK gross domestic product and 8.4 per cent of the UK population. The reality is that the best way to keep being part of the UK research council funding is to keep being part of the UK.</p><p>It would also be remiss of me not to recognise the positive role that UK embassies have played in promoting our universities around the world. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office operates in more than 170 countries, which gives our universities a global presence and actively encourages people from all over the world to come to Scotland to study.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Immigration Policy (Higher Education)"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>The UK embassies promote the UK and Scotland 365 days of the year.

We want to make it possible for people from overseas to come to Scotland to work, study and live. We want Scotland to be a welcoming and inclusive country, as I am sure everyone in the chamber does. That is why we believe that it is counterintuitive for the Scottish Government to want to discriminate against English, Welsh and Northern Irish students if Scotland were to become independent. Not only is the white paper policy of charging students from the rest of the UK tuition fees while not charging other EU students illegal under EU law, the reality is that independence would mean that our higher education funding would be left with a massive black hole of at least &#163;150 million as a result.

Essentially, that means that what is said in the white paper is inaccurate.</p><p>If we are to achieve our ambitions for higher education, we must face up to the challenges that currently exist within the sector. We have the highest drop-out rate, the worst retention rate and damningly low levels of student support. Scottish students are being let down by the Scottish Government. Although we recognise that the issue of student visas needs to be addressed by the UK Government, I urge the Scottish Government to address the important issues for which it is responsible in higher and further education.</p><p>We want to have a system of higher and further education in Scotland that is outward looking and meets the needs of our students.

They lack information about the currency, start-up costs, pensions and taxation. Far from being an opportunity, it appears to be a leap into the unknown.</p><p>I will focus my speech on the two major issues of currency and taxation. It has been made clear that a currency union, the preferred option of this Government, is off the table. No matter how many times Alex Salmond repeats, &#8220;It&#8217;s Scotland&#8217;s pound&#8221;, that will not change the fact that if the rest of the UK does not want a currency union with Scotland we cannot force it into one. Even if a currency union was on offer it would effectively mean handing the key fiscal levers of the economy over to the central bank of another country, while losing our political union and influence.</p><p>Sterlingisation is an even less attractive option. No one is denying that Scotland could use the pound, but without a currency union we would be left without a lender of last resort. That is just not credible. According to the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, sterlingisation would have a knock-on effect on Scotland&#8217;s financial sector, creating a financial border whereby banks would be forced to move their head offices to the country in which the central bank was located. Financial sector exports generate 9 per cent of Scottish GDP, so that would be a huge loss to our economy.</p><p>It is perplexing that the party that pushed for this independence referendum&#8212;a party established in 1934 to fight for Scottish independence&#8212;seems to be fighting so hard against a Scottish currency. Instead it proposes a currency union while stripping away the political union that makes our currency union work.</p><p>Without a clear plan on currency there is no opportunity, only uncertainty: uncertainty for Scottish businesses, uncertainty for Scottish banks and uncertainty for the Scottish people. In effect, there are no answers, no credibility&#8212;no thanks.</p><p>The plan, or lack thereof, on taxation is even more worrying. When I asked Mr Swinney last week whether taxes would need to increase to pay for things promised with a yes vote, he replied:</p><p>&#8220;the answer is no: taxes will not have to go up to pay for independence.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 7 August 2014; c 33153.]</p><p>However, David Philips, the Institute for Fiscal Studies economist, tells us:</p><p>&#8220;an independent Scotland could expect to be running a deficit of around 5% of GDP in 2016-17, which would be larger than that facing the UK as a whole, and would necessitate tax rises or spending cuts.&#8221;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Opportunities of Independence"}, {"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I was not party to that conversation so I will not comment on it.</p><p>Professor Jo Armstrong of the Centre for Public Policy for Regions told the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee:</p><p>&#8220;There are opportunities but ... we either increase taxes ... or cut spending, given that we have a fiscal deficit and, potentially, limits on how much additional borrowing we can make&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, 5 March 2014; c 4079.]</p><p>However, there are no signs of any tax increases or spending cuts in the YESNP&#8217;s plans; instead we are promised tax cuts and spending increases.

Both the Scottish Parliament election and the local government elections had a much higher rejected ballot paper count than was expected. For example, in 2003 only 0.77 per cent of local government ballot papers were rejected, but in 2007 that increased to 1.83 per cent. The 2007 local government elections were also the first local government elections at which the single transferable vote was used.</p><p>Further issues with electronic counting led to Scottish Parliament and local government elections being decoupled, but in the 2012 local government elections, the rejected ballot paper count was still 1.71 per cent, which shows that there are still issues with voters&#8217; understanding of the STV system.</p><p>The decoupling of the elections has also led to a dramatic fall in participation. In 2007, the turnout was 52.8 per cent, but in 2012 it fell to 39.8 per cent. In other words, 60.2 per cent of those who were registered to vote did not feel that it was important enough to turn up. That should concern us all.</p><p>In the Labour Party, we strongly believe in initiatives to increase citizen participation in local issues and, ultimately, the best way of achieving that is by re-empowering local government. Throughout the SNP&#8217;s time in Government, there has been massive centralisation of local government. Instead of citizens being empowered, their power is being taken away, local democracy is decreasing and local people feel disconnected from the process.</p><p>Through our devolution commission, we have argued for a radical agenda for local government and community re-empowerment, including but not limited to an adjustment of powers and responsibilities to suit local circumstances, fixing the broken system of local government finance and allowing authorities more scope to influence economic development. By moving power further down the chain and empowering local people and local government, we can better target the disconnect that is felt at local levels.</p><p>However, we must also work to ensure that voting systems move with the times and make citizenship education part of the school curriculum through personal and social education. Although I hear that that can happen, it is not currently required in curriculum for excellence.</p><p>As for modernising the voting system, we have a range of options including online voting, telephone voting, universal postal votes and even mandatory voting. I am not suggesting that we move wholesale to one system or another, but that we look at whether more systems can be utilised in conjunction with traditional polling places to make voting more flexible and accessible. Although some of those methods raise security issues, I note that people are happy to use online banking systems, and I imagine that they would find online voting acceptable.</p><p>There is no quick fix to the issues that have been presented this afternoon, but I would like this Government to start increasing participation by re-empowering local government and local communities, by making citizenship education a requirement in curriculum for excellence and by setting up a programme to trial new voting systems to ensure that results in future elections are truly representative.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-05-14", "body": "<p>I thank the Presiding Officer and members of all parties for their support in bringing to the chamber this debate on the impact that loneliness can have on physical and mental health. I am leading the debate in my role as convener of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on volunteering and the voluntary sector, which recently received a presentation on the issue of loneliness and its impact on health and the associated financial costs from Liz Watson, chief executive of Befriending Networks. I thank Liz and the CPG for the support that they have provided for the debate. I also thank Macmillan Cancer Support and the Scottish Association for Mental Health for the briefings that they provided in advance of the debate.</p><p>Loneliness and social isolation are complex issues. They are difficult to measure but can affect anyone at any point in their lives. As I state in the motion, 10 per cent of people over 65 in the UK say that they are lonely or very lonely and 20 per cent consider themselves occasionally lonely.</p><p>The recent Volunteer Scotland VEnable report states that there is a &#8220;major gap&#8221; in services for older people and suggests that the gap could be addressed by volunteering and befriending services, which I will discuss later in my speech.</p><p>Loneliness does not affect just the elderly. Studies into the association between loneliness and sociality in middle age, childhood and adolescence show that loneliness in adolescence is strongly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviours, independent of gender, ethnicity or socioeconomic status.</p><p>In adults, loneliness can increase the risk of developing mental health problems, including depressive symptoms and obsessive compulsive disorder, and can more than double a person&#8217;s risk of developing dementia. Worryingly, according to SAMH, isolation is becoming more common in adults. In SAMH&#8217;s &#8220;Worried Sick&#8221; report, a family support worker from Fife stated:</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve also got some clients who live in a local estate and there&#8217;s no services there so that increases the feeling of isolation when people are stuck in their flat ... And that lack of network or support group just increases that feeling of isolation.&#8221;</p><p>That can also be said of people in rural areas where there are very few transport links, and I am sure that some of my colleagues will mention that problem.</p><p>Macmillan Cancer Support recently warned that we are on the verge of a loneliness epidemic and that an estimated 60,000 people are suffering from loneliness as a result of their illness, with 31 per cent of Scots indicating that they are lonelier since diagnosis. It is clear from Macmillan Cancer Support&#8217;s studies that loneliness can have a huge effect on the health and wellbeing of people living with cancer, with those who are lonely being three times more likely to drink more and five times more likely to skip meals.</p><p>Loneliness is a problem that can affect us all, whether young or old, rich or poor, sick or healthy, and it can affect us at any time in our lives. However, people with terminal illnesses or those who are elderly can be hit the hardest. When it comes to tackling the issue we need an all-encompassing strategy, because evidence shows that tackling loneliness is crucial to meeting the national outcome for people in Scotland to live longer, healthier lives.</p><p>I believe that the voluntary sector will be essential in helping us to deal with loneliness and social isolation. As I said, the Volunteer Scotland VEnable report suggests that gaps in services for older people</p><p>&#8220;are ones that would address loneliness and isolation; [this could be] a simple niche for volunteering.&#8221;</p><p>I argue, however, that we should look into using volunteering to address loneliness and social isolation in all age groups.</p><p>Currently, there is a postcode lottery as to who can get services such as befriending. They are funded in a piecemeal manner and there is no overall strategy in Scotland to tie everything together, hence the gaps in services. There may well be a cost associated with filling the gaps, but surely that is worth it when we consider that loneliness has a financial as well as a health cost, and that befriending and similar services contribute to improving the health and wellbeing of the population.</p><p>By tackling loneliness and promoting social participation we encourage healthy behaviour, such as stopping smoking, undertaking more physical activity and increasing consumption of vegetables. Dealing with loneliness has far-reaching effects on improving health and wellbeing. Only through a strategic and coordinated response to the issue of loneliness can we maximise opportunities for such activities as befriending for isolated people in all Scotland&#8217;s communities.</p><p>I ask the minister what consideration the Scottish Government is giving to placing volunteering at the heart of our health and wellbeing policy to tackle loneliness. Volunteering does not just happen; it needs to be properly supported and funded. To assist in that regard, has the Scottish Government considered including the reduction of loneliness as a Scottish Government indicator, so that we can measure the effects of policy? If it did that, perhaps we would live not only longer and healthier lives, but less lonely lives, too.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Loneliness (Impact on Physical and Mental Health)"}, {"date": "2014-05-07", "body": "<p>As stated in Labour&#8217;s amendment, Scotland needs a robust and balanced energy policy that strives to match our energy needs with our climate change and carbon reduction targets.</p><p>I do not agree with the Green Party's motion that unconventional gas extraction should be banned outright; nor do I agree with the approach that has been taken by the Westminster Government, which seems to have embraced shale gas with open arms and has, at times, flouted proper regulation in the rush to do so. Currently, the scale of the impacts of fracking on health, the climate and the local environment is unknown, and it would be foolhardy to welcome the industry until we better understand the implications.</p><p>With that in mind, our approach to fracking should be cautious and based on scientific evidence. It is an industry that could be damaging to our climate change targets, so I am calling on the Scottish Government to bring forward robust national guidelines for all forms of unconventional gas extraction before the industry is allowed to continue in Scotland.</p><p>I see no reason to rush into fracking. An expansion of the shale gas industry is unlikely to assist in our attempts to meet carbon reduction targets, create jobs or bring down energy costs to assist the estimated 900,000 people who currently suffer from fuel poverty.</p><p>It could be argued that shale gas extraction has driven down the cost of energy in the US, but the same is unlikely to occur here. A report that was carried out by the US Energy Information Administration said:</p><p>&#8220;Compared with North America, the shale geology of the UK is considerably more complex, while drilling and completion costs for shale wells are substantially higher.&#8221;</p><p>Friends of the Earth also points to the fact that the industry is unlikely to create significant jobs growth within Scotland, with Dart Energy&#8217;s Airth project likely to create only 20 jobs.</p><p>Fracking might well increase our energy security, but a better way to do that would be to promote a diverse energy supply, including a strong renewables sector, with a drive towards community ownership. That would also help achieve our climate change and carbon reduction targets.</p><p>However, the renewables sector in Scotland could be under threat from separation. Scotland currently receives around a third of all renewables subsides in the UK despite representing only 10 per cent of the consumer base. If we were to separate, that cost would fall to Scottish consumers, inevitably putting up energy costs and forcing even more people into fuel poverty.</p><p>Scottish Labour has always advocated community ownership as a vehicle for empowering local communities, tackling social justice and delivering economic growth. Community ownership in renewables would not only help Scotland to achieve renewables targets but create green jobs while tackling fuel poverty.</p><p>There is no reason to rush into fracking in Scotland. It seems to provide limited gain at this stage against the possibility of a disaster for the environment, our health and our climate change targets. Fracking should be halted until robust national guidelines, including planning guidelines, are in place to ensure that it is in line with our Scottish energy policy. Instead, we should aim to secure an affordable, diverse energy supply that, above all, tackles the scourge of fuel poverty.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Energy and Climate Change"}, {"date": "2014-04-29", "body": "<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate, because inshore fishing is vital to the Scottish economy. The sector was worth &#163;87 million to the economy in 2012 and it exports produce around the world. Inshore fishing also helps to sustain employment in fragile communities.</p><p>The Scottish inshore fishing sector accounts for 75 per cent of the Scottish fleet and, thanks to devolution, the Scottish ministers are responsible for regulating sea fishing around Scotland and within 12 nautical miles of Scotland&#8217;s coast. It is an industry not only that we control but which is vital and profitable to the Scottish economy.</p><p>We must ensure that sustainability is at the heart of our inshore fisheries policy, as organisations such as RSPB Scotland, the Marine Conservation Society and the Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Trust say. With that in mind, I will focus on sustainability issues for most of my speech. I will discuss the Community of Arran Seabed Trust, also known as COAST, which is based on the Isle of Arran, and I will look at the aims and objectives of the Clyde 2020 initiative.</p><p>In the past, according to SIFT,</p><p>&#8220;Over-fishing and the use of fishing gears which damage habitats have not only been permitted but promoted ... the inshore ecosystem has been degraded and the valuable fin-fish stocks have collapsed ... coastal communities no longer enjoy a mixed and vibrant economy.&#8221;</p><p>The effects of bad and unsustainable management are apparent in the region that I represent, where the Firth of Clyde has suffered serious economic and ecological losses since towed fishing gears were allowed. Now, more than 90 per cent of the catch comes from just two species&#8212;scallops and nephrops&#8212;rather than the variety of species that used to exist in the Clyde.</p><p>During a visit to Arran, I had a meeting with COAST at which I heard about the damage that dredging had done to the sea bed and the marine environment. That led COAST to campaign for not only a marine protected area but a no-take zone. The no-take zone was established in 2008 and was the first of its kind in Scotland. Its intention was to not only protect but improve biodiversity in the area.</p><p>The benefits of the no-take zone extend beyond the zone and help to enhance sustainable fisheries, as the zone allows fish in the area to produce up to 100 times more eggs. The zone&#8217;s effects are evident and, although it alone cannot support recovery of the Clyde, it has produced several benefits over the past five years.</p><p>The University of York undertook monitoring of the no-take zone and it found not only that scallop density was increasing around the zone but that it allowed populations to extend and enter a more natural state. The scallops were found to be larger than those elsewhere, and the density of lobster populations was found to be increasing around the zone. That led the university to conclude that</p><p>&#8220;protected areas can be a useful tool in ecosystem-based fishery management and that, by providing fishery and ecological benefits, they can allow seafloor habitats to recover whilst safeguarding the long-term sustainability of commercially important shellfish stocks.&#8221;</p><p>Will the cabinet secretary confirm whether he is looking to establish further no-take zones in strategic areas in the Firth of Clyde or elsewhere? What is being done to address the small scale and lack of flexibility of no-take zones?</p><p>SIFT has proposed a more flexible plan for the sustainable management of Scotland&#8217;s inshore waters. Wider use of regulating orders would allow fishing to continue, but in a managed and sustainable way. Management through regulating orders should be local and flexible while adopting an evidence-based approach; that would allow all types of fishing to continue but would enable an independent management organisation to react quickly and adapt appropriately to changes in stocks and habitats. The proposals for establishing a regulating order in the Clyde are still in the planning stages, but will the Scottish Government consider establishing an order to bring the Clyde back up to good environmental status as part of the target under the European Union marine directive to achieve healthy oceans and seas by 2020?</p><p>Inshore fishing is vital to Scotland&#8217;s economy and it is the life-blood of many of our coastal communities. However, through mismanagement, the diversity of fishing stocks has been destroyed. We must ensure that sustainability is at the heart of our inshore fisheries policy. No-take zones are a useful tool, but more needs to be done to reverse the damage and we need to adopt a more science-based approach to management.</p><p>By placing proper sustainable fishing management at the heart of our policy, we can allow habitats to rebuild and diversity to increase. That will increase the socioeconomic benefits to coastal communities as well as bolstering Scotland&#8217;s wider economy by breathing new life into this vital sector.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Inshore Fisheries"}, {"date": "2014-04-03", "body": "<p>Developing skills for Scotland&#8217;s digital economy has never been more important. The world is increasingly embracing technology in all aspects of life and we need to ensure that Scotland is equipped to be at the forefront of this technological revolution. As we have heard, the recently released skills investment plan has highlighted a worrying trend: from 2007 to 2012, there was a 27 per cent drop in those taking standard grade computing and a 17 per cent drop in intermediate 1 in our schools.</p><p>We can attract investment only if we have the best educated workforce in the world, yet the number of teachers who have computing studies as their main subject has decreased by 13.8 per cent, as has been mentioned many times this afternoon, and it has been reported that some schools do not even have dedicated teaching facilities for computing or ICT skills.</p><p>Between 2005-06 and 2011-12, 140,000 college places were cut and there was a 20,161 drop in the number of further education students who take computer-related courses. I note that the minister said in her opening remarks that the Government is increasing the number of student teachers for those subjects, but if it is to reverse the trend, the number of digital technology-related places in colleges should be increased. Just as important, our schools should at least be offering the subject and ensuring that they use the latest technology.</p><p>Another tool that we should be using to develop skills for Scotland&#8217;s digital economy is modern apprenticeships, which we should ensure are properly accredited and approved and provide people with high-quality training as an alternative to the academic route. We could, for example, have a pooled apprentice scheme to help small businesses afford high-quality apprenticeships and help apprentices gain a wider range of work experience and skills. Such an approach could also address the problem of underrepresentation of young people in certain industries, including ICT.</p><p>As well as that underrepresentation, there is an increasing gender gap in the take-up of apprenticeships; for example, only 16 per cent of the 468 new starts in IT professional modern apprenticeships were female. Furthermore, over the past 10 years, female participation rates in ICT and digital technology occupations have fallen from 30 to 17 per cent. I am interested to hear what the Scottish Government is doing to encourage more girls and women to take up and pursue ICT as a career choice. After all, we do not want to be here in five years' time, discussing the same issues as we are highlighting this afternoon.</p><p>If we are serious about developing skills for a digital economy, we must increase the availability and take-up of courses now and ensure that all schools in Scotland have the capacity to teach the subject and, indeed, are teaching current-generation skills so that they are not outdated by the time the students enter the workplace. We must ensure that modern apprenticeships are robust and properly accredited and give our young people the best chance of gaining a wide range of skills that will lead to a future career, and we also need to tackle the growing gender gap. The quicker we address those issues, the better it will be for our digital sector.</p><p>If our schools and colleges are not offering the right courses or places, if our modern apprenticeships are not robust, and if we do not tackle the increasing gender gap, we risk losing out to countries that are producing the right skills, and we could lose a sector that is becoming increasingly crucial to the Scottish economy overall.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Developing Skills for Scotland&#8217;s Digital Economy"}, {"date": "2014-03-20", "body": "<p>Is the Scottish Government holding a Scotland&#8217;s future meeting on Arran on 30 March and, if so, how much has been spent on similar meetings across Scotland to date?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Ministerial Engagements"}, {"date": "2014-03-19", "body": "<p>I clarify that Labour has always supported the European youth guarantee, having voted for it in the European Parliament. As we heard, the aim is to provide a good-quality offer of a job, apprenticeship, traineeship or continued education for all young people under 25&#8212;with the offer adapted to the individual&#8217;s needs&#8212;within four months of a person leaving formal education or becoming unemployed, whether or not they are registered with employment services.</p><p>That is a great idea and one that I am sure that members whole-heartedly support, all the more because figures released today show that 19.1 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds are unemployed. In one of the areas that I represent&#8212;north Ayrshire&#8212;9.6 per cent of people aged 18 to 24 were claiming jobseekers allowance at the end of last year. That is the second highest rate in Scotland, and it does not reflect the total, because more young people will be unemployed but not claiming.</p><p>I am not convinced of the Scottish National Party&#8217;s commitment to the scheme. The motion states</p><p>&#8220;That the Parliament ... supports the principle aim of the European Youth Guarantee to reduce youth unemployment; endorses the aim of ensuring that all young people under the age of 25 receive a good quality offer of employment&#8221;</p><p>and so on but, as Jenny Marra and Liam McArthur said, SNP MEP Alyn Smith called the guarantee &#8220;a knee jerk reaction&#8221; and &#8220;window dressing&#8221;. The SNP cannot lambast Westminster for not implementing the European youth guarantee and then refer to it as &#8220;window dressing&#8221;. Which is it?</p><p>If the Scottish Government is committed to the scheme, it needs to work harder to deliver it. The current strategy is directed at 16 to 19-year-olds.

The Government tells us that it is doing all that it can, that the situation is not its fault and that Scotland simply does not have all the economic levers that are required to offer opportunities to people aged between 16 and 25. I would argue that the Government does have the power and could be doing more with our colleges and our modern apprenticeships, and yet college places are being cut and our modern apprenticeship programme is not as effective as it could be.</p><p>The Government has presided over massive cuts to colleges, which has meant that the number of part-time college places has dropped by 140,400 since 2007. How can the Government provide opportunities for all when there are not enough places? If we really want to build a stronger economy, we should be opening the doors to colleges in Scotland, not slamming them shut.</p><p>The same strategy is adopted in our modern apprenticeship programme, which is directed at 16 to 19-year-olds. Although the Audit Scotland report &#8220;Modern apprenticeships&#8221;, which was published just last week, tells us that the number of MAs in Scotland has increased, it also points to underlying flaws in the process. For example, the report tells us that</p><p>&#8220;existing performance measures do not focus on long-term outcomes, such as sustainable employment... More specific long-term aims and objectives, along with information on their benefits and appropriate outcome measures&#8221;</p><p>are needed to assess value for money.</p><p>That is a key point. It is great to give young people an opportunity such as a modern apprenticeship, but what is next for them? What follows? I would argue that, if we are to improve the lives of our young people and Scotland&#8217;s economic outlook, we should support Audit Scotland&#8217;s call for more outcome-based measures to assess the long-term benefits and for those benefits to be published. We need to be clear about what modern apprenticeships achieve for young people.</p><p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission&#8217;s report into MAs also argues that the uptake of modern apprenticeships in Scotland is typified by significant gender segregation, with ethnic minorities and disabled people also appearing to have low levels of access to all forms of apprenticeships. For example, less than 0.5 per cent of all modern apprenticeship placements are taken by someone with a declared disability and less than 2 per cent are taken by ethnic minorities, while 98 per cent of construction placements are still taken by men. Equality should be at the heart of our legislation, and MAs should be no different. What is the Scottish Government doing to tackle the problem?</p><p>I find it concerning that figures that were released following a freedom of information request in December last year showed that there are 15,000 school leavers that the Government cannot find. Those 15,000 young people have not been given the same opportunity of a job, training or education because they have been lost from the system. That is simply unacceptable. Will the Government explain today why that was allowed to happen?</p><p>The Government could be doing more with the powers that it has to provide a better future for our young people. We should be looking at the long-term outcomes of modern apprenticeships, tackling the equality issues and making sure that our colleges are properly funded. If the Government is serious about the European youth guarantee, it should target opportunities for all at 16 to 25-year-olds now instead of telling us that it can do that only after independence.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: European Youth Guarantee"}, {"date": "2014-01-16", "body": "<p>These amendments aim to deal with the issues that were raised in evidence sessions about the idea to link planning fees to performance.

If the provisions are genuinely meant to improve and incentivise planning authorities, it makes no sense to penalise a planning authority to such an extent that it further affects its performance. That could result in it being penalised further as a result of something that might be no fault of its own and could introduce unnecessary financial uncertainty around its funding.</p><p>Amendment 12 is self-explanatory. It states that the level and period for which the lower fees are put in place would not</p><p>&#8220;adversely affect the performance of, or, as the case may be, the range of services offered by the planning authority.&#8221;</p><p>Amendment 13 asks that before making any changes</p><p>&#8220;the Scottish Ministers must lay before the Scottish Parliament a statement setting out ... the percentage variation by which, and the period for which, they propose to vary the fee or charge.&#8221;</p><p>That would ensure that power cannot be misused, and it would offer safeguards that I feel are not currently explicitly set out in the bill.

They are waking up to the opportunities of independence and are realising that Scotland is not a poor country but in fact one of the wealthiest countries in the world. It is wealthier per head than countries such as France and Japan, and wealthier than the rest of the UK, but it does not feel that way, and it often does not look that way.</p><p>Those new-found feelings of opportunity, hope and ambition contrast sharply with the disempowerment and stagnation of the Westminster system. After all, that is a system that regularly imposes Tory Governments on Scotland without any democratic mandate from the Scottish people. Scotland&#8217;s future must be in Scotland&#8217;s hands.</p><p>Our Parliament has already shown that, where we have the power, we make the best decisions for Scotland, and nowhere is that more evident than in our education system. While we have adhered to the principle of access to education based on the ability to learn and not the ability to pay, Westminster is burdening English students with fees of up to &#163;9,000 a year. A Sutton Trust report concluded that many students will still be repaying student loans into their 40s and 50s, and that some will never clear their debts.</p><p>However, having a bit of power over a bit of the system is akin to a boxer fighting with one hand tied behind his back. He might strike the odd blow, but ultimately he cannot win. Our lack of macro-economic power means that more than 700,000 Scots have emigrated in the past 10 years, including more than 30,000 young people a year. We need to ensure not only that we continue to be a world leader in education, but that the Scottish Parliament has the economic levers to create opportunities for our young people here at home in Scotland.</p><p>If people choose to travel the world to seek out new opportunities and experiences, that is absolutely fantastic, but if they are forced to leave, splitting up families because they can only find work elsewhere, that is a failure and a disgrace. Watching the grandchildren grow up via Skype is not the kind of future that I want for the families of Scotland.</p><p>The no campaign continually uses the negative language of splits and separation to describe the universally recognised normal state that others call independence, but the truth is that independence will provide us with the opportunities to keep families together. It will allow young people to choose to stay and work here in Scotland, near to their families, if that is what they want to do.</p><p>However, Westminster&#8217;s damage has extended beyond its failure to balance economic opportunities across the UK. The UK Government has made it increasingly difficult for international students to study here. Professor Wright of the University of Strathclyde said that UK Government policy on international students was &#8220;a disaster&#8221; that makes us &#8220;less competitive&#8221;.</p><p>International students contribute hundreds of millions of pounds to the economy every year, yet Westminster&#8217;s ideologically driven immigration policy is putting that at risk. To prevent further damage to our economy and to our higher education sector, Scotland needs a yes vote and the transfer of powers over immigration to the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>Every day, on doorsteps and in public meetings throughout Scotland, more and more people are waking up to the opportunities of independence.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>The referendum is about many things, but fundamentally it is about the desire to seize the opportunity of a lifetime; to choose between two futures that could not be more different; and to decide whether to leave our future in the hands of Westminster or to bring power over Scotland home to Scotland.

We appreciated the detailed submissions that we received. I also want to thank all those who took the time to come along to talk to us during our visit to Orkney. Finally, I thank my committee colleagues, the clerks and the Scottish Parliament information centre for all their hard work and support during the stage 1 process.</p><p>The Historic Environment Scotland Bill is one of those bills that appear to be relatively straightforward&#8212;the legislation will basically create a new body to continue the functions of its predecessors, Historic Scotland and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. However, of course, stage 1 scrutiny is never that simple, and we addressed in our report a number of questions or concerns that were raised in evidence. We also considered ways of improving the bill and the wider strategy that was referred to by the cabinet secretary.</p><p>I will address some of those points in a minute, but I highlight at the outset that we welcomed the intended benefits of the merger and unanimously endorsed the bill&#8217;s general principles.</p><p>I also highlight that our report laid down something of a challenge to the other members who would be taking part in this debate. That challenge stems from the frank but welcome admission that some parts of Scotland are punching below their weight in realising the full benefits of the historic environment. Other parts of the country are, of course, doing very well.</p><p>Given that comment, which we received while taking evidence, we want other MSPs to consider how they can best help to promote Scotland&#8217;s historic environment to make sure that its value is fully realised. If, as parliamentarians, we endorse a bill and a strategy that advocate improvement, partnership working and better leadership, it might strengthen our position if we demonstrate those qualities ourselves.</p><p>In considering the bill&#8217;s merits, the committee was fortunate enough to visit an area of the country that is crammed full of architectural and cultural treasures. A sun-filled day in Orkney in May&#8212;Liam McArthur assures me that it is always like that&#8212;is notable for many reasons, not least the beauty of a landscape that can leave a profound impression on anyone who visits.</p><p>It is such impressions that help to confirm the value of our heritage in the broadest sense, not just in terms of increasing commercial exploitation or tourism numbers, but in connecting us to our shared history, our landscape and our cultural heritage. It is a source of some pride that we could have visited virtually any other region of Scotland and been treated to a different but similar display of historic and cultural richness.</p><p>One of the findings that we took from Orkney, and one of the recurring themes of our report, is the need for better communication about some of the bill&#8217;s provisions. For example, there is some concern in the sector about the extent of the new body&#8217;s remit. Although historic environment Scotland is to</p><p>&#8220;investigate, care for and protect the historic environment&#8221;,</p><p>we questioned whether that meant all of the historic environment. For example, we noted that the vast majority of historic buildings are under private ownership and responsibility.</p><p>The cabinet secretary confirmed that the new organisation will be better placed to provide leadership and work collaboratively with the sector but that it will not have the direct responsibility for the historic environment that some stakeholders had thought that it would. To avoid any doubt about historic environment Scotland&#8217;s role, we have called on the Scottish Government to explain that as clearly as possible to all relevant bodies working in the sector.</p><p>We made a similar recommendation about the need to establish a shared understanding of what the term &#8220;historic environment&#8221; encompasses. One of our main discussions in taking evidence was whether the bill itself should define &#8220;historic environment&#8221;, while recognising that there is a full definition contained in the strategy. On balance, we were persuaded by the cabinet secretary&#8217;s arguments that the bill need not define the term. However, the crucial factor is that we must avoid any possible legal confusion about the division of responsibilities between historic environment Scotland and other relevant bodies. As there appears to be a general agreement that the definition in the strategy is sufficiently clear, we have called on the Government to ensure that all parties have a shared understanding of the definition when the bill and strategy are implemented.</p><p>I want to mention three further areas on which we have called on the Government to provide clarification to stakeholders to make sure that their concerns are addressed. First, we want the cabinet secretary to confirm who would be responsible for paying for the repair and maintenance bill for the &#8220;properties in care&#8221;&#8212;the 345 properties that are managed by ministers for the nation. There appears to be some uncertainty in some quarters on that point.</p><p>Secondly, some organisations expressed concern to us that the new body may be at risk of a conflict of interests. That concern was linked in part to the suggestion that historic environment Scotland could increasingly be focused on raising income and therefore less focused on undertaking its regulatory functions. Other committee members, I am sure, will mention those issues in their contributions. Although we were unconvinced about new conflicts of interest emerging, we recognised that organisations had some legitimate concerns. We have therefore called on the cabinet secretary to continue to speak to those groups that have made positive suggestions as to how their concerns could be addressed.</p><p>We noted in doing so that the successful implementation of the bill and the strategy will largely depend on effective partnership working and the goodwill of all parties involved. We called for further clarification from the Government on one other area. In essence, we want to be clear about the relationship between the board set up to drive the historic environment strategy and the separate historic environment Scotland board. Again, other members will no doubt discuss that issue, but we particularly want to understand how the two boards will work together should problems arise in implementing the strategy.</p><p>I wish to conclude by reiterating another theme from our report: ensuring that progress is made and that all parts of Scotland can punch above their weight. I began by suggesting that all members have a role to play in helping to promote our shared historic environment. We also have an interest in making sure that the anticipated benefits of the bill and strategy are actually delivered. The committee intends to play its part in that and we therefore intend to assess the progress made once the new organisation has been established and the strategy has been implemented. We make that recommendation at paragraph 19 of our report.</p><p>We have also made a related but more specific recommendation to the Government at paragraph 20. Historic environment Scotland is to regularly publish a corporate plan, setting out the outcomes to be delivered. We consider that the annual reports should not just be forward looking but should say which previous objectives have or have not been achieved. We consider that that will help to make such reports more balanced, and give a clearer picture of where success has or has not been delivered. I am sure that all members would find that useful.</p><p>In the time available I have not been able to mention or discuss in depth all the main points that are raised in our report. However, I know that other committee members will wish to raise issues such as how historic environment Scotland can exercise its functions in a way that takes due account of local issues and local decision making processes; the exact role historic environment Scotland will play in relation to the marine environment; and the possible impact of the new body being granted charitable status.</p><p>I once again thank all those who engaged with the committee during our stage 1 examination of the bill and say that, although there are details that require attention and discussion as we go forward with the bill, the committee unanimously backs the principles of the Historic Environment (Scotland) Bill.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>Today&#8217;s debate on the impact of immigration policy on higher education in Scotland is very timely. In recent years, the UK Government&#8217;s approach to immigration policy has become illogical and damaging to different aspects of society, particularly our higher education sector. In a bid to appease the Tory rebels on their back benches and in the vain hope of scuttling the rise of UKIP in England, David Cameron and Theresa May have pursued a politically motivated immigration policy instead of one that is functional and addresses the needs of the UK&#8217;s constituent parts.</p><p>That policy has manifested itself in a desire to cut overall migrant numbers. Indeed, the ability to cut migrant numbers, regardless of the impact on business or education, is now the self-defined measure of success for the UK Government&#8217;s immigration policy. The UK Government knows that it cannot cut numbers from the EU to meet those targets, so it is imposing increasingly strict immigration criteria on non-EU citizens who wish to come here, including many of the students who would like to study at Scotland&#8217;s world-leading universities and colleges.</p><p>The decision to impose further restrictions on non-EU migrants as a perceived solution to EU migration epitomises the UK Government&#8217;s increasingly nonsensical and dysfunctional approach to immigration policy. As a result, the number of students coming from India to Scotland has fallen by 58 per cent, while the number of students moving from India to Australia has increased by 70 per cent. Other English-speaking countries such as the United States and Canada have also enjoyed healthy increases in international student numbers. Scotland is now lagging behind, with non-EU student numbers decreasing.</p><p>The impact of the UK Government&#8217;s policies has not gone unnoticed. Indeed, those policies have been doggedly pursued in spite of the criticism of industry specialists. In 2013, the High Court ruled that UK visa rules were &#8220;unjustified&#8221; and &#8220;disproportionate&#8221;, infringing on the rights of both British citizens and those wishing to come here.</p><p>In recent evidence to the European and External Relations Committee, Professor Wright of the University of Strathclyde called the current UK Government policies on international students &#8220;a disaster&#8221;, which made us &#8220;less competitive&#8221;.</p><p>The principal of the University of Glasgow, Professor Anton Muscatelli, is of a similar view, stating that UK Government immigration rules are damaging to the higher education sector in Scotland and that they create an international perception that students are not welcome here.</p><p>The UK Government bluntly reinforced that point with its high-profile &#8220;Go home&#8221; poster campaign, which was subsequently withdrawn after the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the campaign was predicated on misleading and inaccurate statistics.</p><p>Professor Muscatelli continued by saying that the message that we are &#8220;closed for education&#8221; is</p><p>&#8220;exactly the opposite message that a number of other countries are sending, including the US, Canada and Australia. I don&#8217;t think we should be there as a country.&#8221;</p><p>Ultimately, however, Scotland has no say over the matter.</p><p>Scotland attracts 40,000 students from 180 countries every year&#8212;students who contribute more than &#163;779 million to the economy annually. The benefits of international students are not simply quantifiable in monetary terms. Foreign students develop an international outlook among our own home-grown students, and they enrich the learning experience for everyone in the education sector.</p><p>NUS Scotland&#8217;s evidence to the Education and Culture Committee succinctly stated the case by saying:</p><p>&#8220;immigration, including that for the purposes of study, provides huge benefits to Scotland and the UK, and should be wholly encouraged.&#8221;</p><p>It is difficult to understand why we should allow the benefits of migration to be threatened by the politically motivated immigration policy being imposed by Westminster. Scotland can, should and must choose a different path, and a yes vote in September will ensure that we have a sensible, measured and proportionate immigration policy, as outlined in the Scottish Government&#8217;s white paper on independence.</p><p>Studies undertaken by the migration observatory at the University of Oxford found that a majority of people would prefer immigration decisions to be taken by Holyrood, rather than at Westminster. The study also found that there was public sympathy for the Scottish Government&#8217;s position of encouraging international students to study here.</p><p>One measure that we could immediately reintroduce with independence is the post-study work visa. The UK Government made a short-sighted decision in withdrawing the scheme, which allowed many highly skilled and educated migrants to remain in Scotland. It makes little sense to train graduates only then to tell them to leave the country. I am delighted that there seems to be universal agreement in the Parliament that we should introduce a post-study visa. The problem with the Opposition&#8217;s argument is that what the UK Government giveth the UK Government then taketh away. Although there is universal agreement here, we can do nothing while the powers rest with Westminster.</p><p>The reintroduction of the post-study work visa will help to attract international students to our universities and colleges and to deliver the economic prosperity that could be achieved with independence. Independence will also give us the full range of powers to incentivise innovation and to encourage research investment in our universities. It will allow our higher education sector to compete effectively for the best international students and to create a country that is welcoming and open to international researchers.</p><p>It is clear that there is little hope of reform while Scotland is part of the UK. Our colleges and universities can only watch powerlessly as events in the south of England negatively impact upon the future prospects of the education sector in Scotland. Scotland would be better served by an immigration policy that was tailored to suit Scotland&#8217;s specific circumstances, rather than following the one-size-fits-all approach taken by Westminster. Scotland&#8217;s needs are different from those of the south of England, and independence will allow us to create an immigration system that is fair and proportionate, and which works in conjunction with the higher education system, rather than against it.</p><p>It is important for international students to know that Scotland is open for business, that they are a welcome addition to our society and that the negative and damaging voice of Westminster does not reflect the views that are commonly held here in Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Immigration Policy (Higher Education)"}, {"date": "2014-05-28", "body": "<p>I would like to begin with a quotation from the late Professor Ailsa McKay. Professor McKay was much respected and admired across the chamber for her hard work and dedication to improving outcomes for women and disadvantaged groups in Scotland. Writing in the Sunday Herald in December 2013 about her ambitions for the childcare plans that are outlined in the white paper, Professor McKay said:</p><p>&#8220;The highest rates of employment of mothers are in Scandinavia, where public investment in childcare is high. If Scotland could replicate this, tens of thousands of more women would be in work in Scotland. A higher female employment rate increases economic growth and productivity and has a positive impact on fertility, making it more likely that population growth will be above replacement rate &#8230; additional investment in childcare provision would more than pay for itself in the medium term.&#8221;</p><p>Labour talks about the importance of ensuring that childcare remains</p><p>&#8220;at the top of the political agenda, regardless of the ... result&#8221;</p><p>of September&#8217;s referendum. That was a point that was made by Professor Mackay and I agree with the sentiment, although I must say that I am disappointed&#8212;but not surprised&#8212;that the Labour Party has chosen to attack the Scottish Government&#8217;s childcare plans. If Labour really believed in a transformational change in childcare, it would be right behind the Scottish Government&#8217;s ambitious proposals.</p><p>Of course, Labour has form on this kind of behaviour. A few months back, we witnessed Labour MSPs teaming up with the Tories to vote against the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals for free school meals and improved childcare provision. It appeared then that that was just another example of the Labour Party choosing to oppose for opposition&#8217;s sake&#8212;particularly as the Scottish Government&#8217;s plans had been welcomed by a wide range of children&#8217;s charities and child poverty campaigners. Labour&#8217;s actions at the time were rightly condemned in the press and in communities across Scotland, so I had hoped that lessons had been learned about the danger of attacking everything that is proposed by the SNP just for the sake of political point scoring. However, sadly, I was wrong.</p><p>In the childcare debate in January, I highlighted the work that has been carried out by Professor Edward Melhuish of the University of London. Professor Melhuish&#8217;s research has demonstrated the long-term benefits of effective childcare, particularly for children from deprived backgrounds. Those findings were reinforced by a recent research paper that was published by the Scottish Government, entitled &#8220;Childcare and Children&#8217;s Intellectual Outcomes&#8221;, which concluded that high-quality nursery education not only enhances development in children in their early years, but aids attainment in children at all ages. The paper highlights evidence that pre-school education enhances all-round development in children and is particularly beneficial to children from disadvantaged backgrounds, in helping to improve cognitive development, sociability and concentration. Those benefits continue into primary and secondary school, with research demonstrating that pupils aged 15 who attended pre-school education tend to outperform those who did not.</p><p>Although there are for parents and children significant social benefits from improved childcare, there is also a strong economic case for investment in early years education. In written evidence that has been submitted to Parliament, Professor McKay and her colleagues at the women in Scotland&#8217;s economy research centre at Glasgow Caledonian University highlighted research that shows how important investment in childcare is to stimulating economic growth.</p><p>Growth in the construction industry is often held up as a barometer of how well the economy is doing. The research centre at GCU suggests that, in economic terms, the development of a high-quality childcare sector is just as important as development of the construction sector, in that one creates physical capital and the other creates human capital.</p><p>It is argued that a lack of access to adequate affordable childcare is damaging to the economy and to society as a whole, because that lack it acts as a barrier to participation in the labour market by parents&#8212;in particular, by mothers. Enabling more women to contribute to the economy through better provision of affordable childcare can help to lift families out of poverty and tackle inequality in earnings. That is an ambition that I hope all members share.</p><p>The social and economic benefits of improved early years provision are not in doubt; the question is how we can ensure that children and families here gain access to opportunities that are similar to those that are enjoyed by our Scandinavian neighbours. Childcare costs in Scotland and the rest of the UK are among the highest in Europe. We spend an average of 26.5 per cent of parental income on childcare, compared to the OECD average of almost 12 per cent. A recent report by the Family and Childcare Trust suggests that families are paying more than &#163;7,500 per year in childcare costs for two children, which amounts to more than the average cost of a mortgage.</p><p>Under devolution, Scotland has made some progress in improving access to affordable childcare, and I welcome that. Since the SNP came to power, we have increased free nursery provision by 20 per cent. The improvements in flexible early learning and childcare that have been delivered through the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 will benefit more than 120,000 children in Scotland and help to save families about &#163;700 per year. That will be welcomed by hard-pressed families throughout Scotland, although the reality is that only with the powers and resources of independence can we bring about the transformational change that is needed to provide the best possible start in life for children in Scotland.</p><p>Labour MSPs assert that that can be done now under the limited powers of devolution. If that is the case, why were those ambitious plans not advanced when the Labour Party was in power in the previous two Administrations, and why cannot it tell us now how it would pay for them under the devolution settlement?</p><p>Professor Sir Donald MacKay, who is a leading economist and a former chair of Scottish Enterprise, hit the nail on the head when he said that</p><p>&#8220;No financially responsible Scottish Government would dare to implement the childcare proposals under the fixed block grant funding of devolution, unless they were prepared to take an axe to existing programmes&#8221;.</p><p>I look forward to hearing from the Labour Party what public services it plans to cut in order to finance more childcare now, under the current limited devolution settlement.</p><p>I have already outlined the benefits to the economy that increased access to childcare provides. The Scottish Government has been clear in its commitment to improving access to affordable high-quality early learning and childcare. The Minister for Children and Young People has spoken of her ambition to make Scotland the best place in the world in which to grow up. With the opportunities of independence, we can do just that.

I see September&#8217;s referendum as a once-in-a-generation chance to change Scotland for the better. For me, independence is a means to an end, not an end in itself.

In any case, the idea that it should be up to Scottish voters to save the rest of the UK from the Tories is fundamentally wrong and undemocratic. The people in the rest of the UK have the right to get the Government they vote for&#8212;that is what democracy is all about. The irony of Brian Wilson&#8217;s comments is that they serve only to remind us that a yes vote will ensure that Scots are no longer subjected to policies from Governments that they do not vote for.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-04-30", "body": "<p>We have 140 days to go. On 18 September, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to grasp this power for future generations, and we should take that opportunity by voting yes.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-04-22", "body": "<p>Before I begin my speech, I will comment on Alex Rowley&#8217;s speech. He quoted a member from Ireland saying that one of the great things that the Irish can do is make alliances with, for example, the UK, to form a powerful block in the European Union. Of course they can do that, but do the Irish then go on to say that, because they can form such alliances, they want to be represented in the European Union by London? Of course they do not say that. They form alliances when it is appropriate for them to do so, but when they want to vote differently from the UK, they can choose to do so. We cannot do that; that is the big difference.</p><p>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to take part in the debate because, as a member of the Committee of the Regions in the EU, I visit Brussels regularly and I see for myself how much stronger Scotland&#8217;s voice in the EU would be in an independent Scotland.</p><p>The European Union has 28 member states, ranging from large states such as Germany, with a population in excess of 80&#160;million, to states such as Cyprus, which has a population of just over three quarters of a million people. Therefore, Scotland would certainly not be the smallest state in the EU. Furthermore, increasing evidence highlights that the smaller EU member states, such as Finland, Sweden and Denmark, are relatively more successful in European Union negotiations than are the large member states.</p><p>The EU aims to promote the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. Over the past 60 years, it has grown to become the world&#8217;s largest single market with more than 500&#160;million consumers. If Scotland were independent, the Scottish Government would be involved fully as an equal partner in the decisions taken by the European Union. We are represented in negotiations by the Westminster Government, but when it is faced with competing priorities between, for example, what is best for Scotland and what is best for the city of London, Scotland loses out. That would never happen with an independent Scottish Government, whatever its political persuasion.</p><p>Successive Westminster Governments have failed to protect the interests of Scotland and the current Government is still failing to deal fairly with Scotland when it comes to the EU. In the newly negotiated agricultural subsidies for 2014 to 2020&#8212;the pillar 1 of the common agricultural policy that other members have mentioned&#8212;the UK Government received pillar 1 convergence uplift only because of Scotland&#8217;s low per hectare payment rate. We must remember that about 85 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s land has less favoured area status as compared with about 15 per cent of land in England. Despite that, the Westminster Government has decided to allocate that convergence uplift money pro rata across the UK, so that Scotland&#8217;s farmers and crofters will not receive the full payments that the EU intended them to have. In effect, farmers in East Anglia are receiving payments designed for crofters in the Western Isles. If Scotland had been independent when the latest CAP budget was being decided, we would have benefited from a principle that, by 2020, no member state would receive less than an average of &#8364;196 per hectare. That would have brought Scotland an extra &#8364;1&#160;billion between 2014 and 2020.</p><p>Fishing is another industry that is vital to Scotland&#8217;s economy but here again Scotland&#8217;s interests are not properly represented. Despite the fact that two thirds of the UK fishing industry is based in Scotland, the Scottish ministers have not been allowed to speak on behalf of the UK in Europe, even when the interest to be discussed is almost exclusively Scottish. None of that is surprising when we learn, as we did when papers from Ted Heath&#8217;s Government were released under the 30-year rule, that a Scottish Office memo from the time stated that the Scottish fishing industry</p><p>&#8220;must be regarded as expendable&#8221;.</p><p>Scotland, its interests and its people have not been Westminster&#8217;s priority for a very long time.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s aims for Scotland fit very well with the EU&#8217;s growth strategies. In 2010, the European Union set a 10-year growth strategy for the EU entitled Europe 2020. The strategy set seven flagship initiatives to maximise the potential of the EU&#8217;s member states and the initiatives closely match our own targets for Scotland&#8217;s growth.</p><p>For example initiative 3 is the &#8220;digital agenda for Europe&#8221; and aims to speed up the roll-out of high-speed internet and to reap the benefits of a digital single market. Scotland, with its remote and scattered population, would benefit enormously from the realisation of such an initiative, and the areas of Scotland that would benefit the most are those that are most in need of investment and development.</p><p>The food and drink sector contributes 18 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s overseas exports but a bit less than 1.5 per cent of the overseas exports of the UK as a whole. It is therefore vital to Scotland&#8217;s business interests that Scotland retains the access to the common market that membership of the EU brings. In 2010, the EU 27 accounted for more than 25 per cent of total world output.</p><p>We cannot afford to be shut out from that market. However, if Scotland remains in the UK and there is, as seems likely, a referendum on Europe in the next Westminster Parliament, there is a real possibility that Scotland could vote to stay in the EU but end up outside the EU. Our access to a market of around 500&#160;million people would be threatened, as a result of our being outvoted by the rest of the UK.</p><p>If we were independent, we would have our own voice in Europe to protect our interests and argue our case. At the moment, Scotland&#8217;s interests are never a priority. Scotland benefits from being part of the European Union, but an independent Scotland would benefit much more. No longer would we stand on the sidelines while others weighed our interests against their priorities. No longer would we have to hope that the UK Government would put Scotland first; we would know that a Scottish Government would always do so. Who among us would let their business interests or personal financial matters and relationships with others be dealt with by an intermediary? That is Scotland&#8217;s position with regard to the EU, as long as we stay in the UK.</p><p>Europe Day is celebrated on 9 May each year. It is a celebration of peace and unity in Europe. I hope that in 2016 we will be able to take our place as a fully independent member of the EU and happily join in the celebrations with all our European neighbours, including the rest of the UK.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Voice in the European Union"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14044.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14044", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Stewart Maxwell", "member_id": "80535", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "West Scotland"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Stewart", "last_name": "Maxwell", "left_house": "2011-03-23", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14044.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14044", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Stewart Maxwell", "member_id": "80349", "entered_house": "2007-05-03", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "West of Scotland"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Stewart", "last_name": "Maxwell", "left_house": "2007-04-02", "title": "Mr", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14044.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14044", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Mr Stewart Maxwell", "member_id": "80074", "entered_house": "2003-05-01", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "West of Scotland"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Stuart", "last_name": "McMillan", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-20", "body": "<p></p><p>2.

The list reminds us that Scotland is full of outstanding entrepreneurs, talented athletes, conscious citizens and compassionate caretakers. The &#8220;Finding Scotland&#8217;s Real Heroes&#8221; programme highlights those who have had a positive impact on the community, and invites the Scottish people to get to know what those heroes have done while encouraging them to support efforts in their own communities and become involved.</p><p>I will highlight one of those great nominees: a lady called Vicki McCarthy from Inverclyde. Ms McCarthy is the founder and executive director of REACH for autism. She is a hard-working and proud mother who has a child with autism. She is one of the nominees for the community entrepreneur of the year award.</p><p>In the past few years, Vicki has been a great support to many parents. She has worked as a nurse both domestically and abroad, but not long ago she felt that she ought to change direction and focus her efforts on studying autism after her daughter was diagnosed in 2005. She is without doubt passionate about helping people with autism to reach their full potential and to become contributing and valued members of their local community. She would also like to help and support families to better understand and appreciate loved ones with autism.</p><p>REACH for autism was founded when Vicki became frustrated with the lack of support and services for people living with autism. She and a group of parents and allies decided to take matters into their own hands and work to provide a long-term sustainable solution, not by replacing or duplicating what is already done but by working to plug any gaps in service delivery. REACH provides a wide range of support and services for people with autism and their loved ones. The organisation states that its primary goal is to create &#8220;connection and community&#8221; for all people with autism.</p><p>REACH has developed its own method, which is known as the REACH way. It is a simple approach that focuses on relationships, education, action, community and health&#8212;or REACH, which is very clever. The method is delivered by a team that includes parents of autistic children, occupational therapists, social workers, families, community supporters and other members of the community. The programme is an excellent way to create community integration and involvement.</p><p>Some of the specific programmes that REACH organises include group workshops, educational courses, seminars and stress management programmes. It also produces a newsletter that covers current events and issues in the community relating to autism.</p><p>REACH has grown rapidly. Earlier this year, it opened a base in Ratho Street in Greenock, and only this week Michael Matheson MSP, the Scottish Government&#8217;s Minister for Public Health, paid it a visit. I know that he was greatly impressed by what he saw, particularly as he had met Vicki and another couple of representatives a few years ago when they had bags of enthusiasm and support but precious little resource.</p><p>Vicki is a truly remarkable woman. When I see her next, she will probably chin me for saying this, but she is certainly not scared of asking people for help. Once she actually has someone&#8217;s number and email address, they know that she will actually use them, and she does. I do not mind that, however, because I know that Vicki and her team are doing such positive work and getting results.</p><p>I wish to express my gratitude to the organisers of the &#8220;Finding Scotland&#8217;s Real Heroes&#8221; programme for their efforts to recognise a few of the many people who are working to make Scotland an incredible place.

I suspect that the vote at 5pm will be akin to previous votes, but that does not make the debate any less important. Such a debate is important at any time, and one thing is sure: the policy decision on Trident renewal matters to many people throughout Scotland and the rest of the UK. As such, it matters in the debate on Scotland&#8217;s future.</p><p>I have stated before and I state again that I disagree with the renewal of the Trident programme and with nuclear weapons. The money for the nuclear programme could be better invested in other policy areas. I genuinely believe that Trident renewal is a missed opportunity by the UK Government and that the only way that we can remove Trident from Scotland is by voting yes next month.</p><p>We are consistently told that nuclear weapons are a deterrent against some big, bad bogeyman. In the past, that was the USSR and we saw an increase in the nuclear arms race as a consequence. Nowadays, however, the threat need not come from a country; it can come from individuals or from groups that have a particular cause, and the existence of nuclear weapons in Scotland has not stopped such individuals and groups undertaking their actions. Having nuclear weapons did not prevent an attack on Glasgow airport nor an attack on public transport in London.</p><p>One of the areas of discussion in the referendum debate is the future of Faslane. Faslane will have a future.

They should stop taking the electorate for fools.</p><p>At the weekend, when I was out canvassing, I spoke to a teacher who was not aware that the UK does not have a written constitution&#8212;a dubious accolade that it shares with Israel and New Zealand. She was furious and asked how any nation can act in such a manner. With independence, Scotland will have the opportunity to have a written constitution. Furthermore, we will have the opportunity to ensure that, constitutionally, we can rid Scotland of nuclear weapons. What a fantastic legacy that would be for our future generations. With independence, we can secure the future of Faslane and the jobs that are there; we can rid Scotland of nuclear weapons, which we aim to do in the first term of an independent Scottish Parliament; and we can create a new Scotland by having a written constitution, which is sorely missing at the UK level. In that constitution, we can guarantee that there will be no nuclear weapons in Scotland again. In the years to come, I will be proud to explain to my daughters that I helped to create that legacy. It is a legacy that future generations will thank us for, instead of blaming us for failing to act when we had the chance.</p><p>Independence offers us the opportunity to take responsibility and to rid ourselves of Trident, thus saving our economy billions of pounds in wasted expenditure. It is estimated that, by the mid-2020s, Trident renewal will cost the UK &#163;4 billion per annum, which is a huge amount of wasted money. It is estimated that Trident renewal will cost up to &#163;100 billion at 2012 prices&#8212;what a huge waste of money. Just think of the other opportunities that could open up if we did not have nuclear weapons and nuclear submarines. We know that there is oil off the west coast of Scotland and that Westminster Governments have refused drilling licences to extract that oil.

I think that the approach that we took&#8212;going from regeneration activities of the past to those of the present day&#8212;will be advantageous to all readers of the report. Also, the number of community representatives whom we spoke to in Parliament and outwith it added hugely to our findings and recommendations. Clearly, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for regeneration; various models have been and will need to be deployed.</p><p>As we have heard, the inquiry was wide-ranging. One of the areas that we considered was the role of the urban regeneration companies. As we know, in 2006, following the recommendations that were made in the cities review of 2002, six URCs were established in Scotland to lead the physical, economic, social and community regeneration of some of the most deprived areas of the country. URCs are formal partnerships of key representatives from the public and private sectors, and they operate at arm&#8217;s length from partner organisations.</p><p>There were some differences in the set-up and aims of the URCs. Raploch Urban Regeneration Company and PARC Craigmillar were aimed at community regeneration; Clyde Gateway was aimed at both community and economic regeneration; and Riverside Inverclyde, Clydebank Rebuilt and Irvine Bay were aimed mainly at economic regeneration. However, in general, the committee was disappointed that the response of some of the URCs was inflexible when they were unable to run their original ambitious plans. The committee accepted that economic conditions played a part in that, but that cannot be used as the sole reason for the inflexibility.</p><p>I agree with the Scottish Government when it states in its response to the committee&#8217;s report, that</p><p>&#8220;URCs have a made a difference to their communities and are continuing to do so.&#8221;</p><p>Many positive differences have been made.

We were reassured when told that action was being taken in this regard.&#8221;</p><p>We acknowledge that a number of URCs have community representation on their boards, but we believe that more could be done by the URCs to embed the community in their decision-making structures, and improve accountability for such large public investment.</p><p>One of our recommendations, in paragraph 483, was that</p><p>&#8220;the Scottish Government reviews URCs&#8217; progress to date, including their governance arrangements, and reviews the aims of the URCs in light of the economic climate to ensure that they are appropriately placed to deliver on their objectives. The review should re-establish a strategy and funding appropriate for the tasks in the current ... economic climate, to ensure full benefit from the public investment.&#8221;</p><p>In its response to the committee, the Scottish Government said that it feels that it would be inappropriate to do that. I ask it to reconsider its position, because it appears to be the case that not all URCs have enough local input to ensure that they are meeting local aims and needs.</p><p>That brings me to community involvement, which has been mentioned already. For a regeneration project to have the best chance of success, community involvement is imperative, but it is clear that not all partners are placing enough emphasis on true community participation in their approaches to regeneration, or are doing so too late in their decision-making processes. The committee heard the same message during the public services reform inquiry.</p><p>On page 3 of our report we state:</p><p>&#8220;For regeneration to be truly community led, particularly when it is being delivered by mainstream budgets of local authorities and other partners, communities need to be able to actively contribute to the decision making process on public services at an early stage.&#8221;</p><p>That will mean providing resources to encourage communities to get involved, and equipping them with the skills, knowledge and confidence to be active participants in the process. Furthermore, on page 5 of the report, the committee states that</p><p>&#8220;Community capacity building is a concept yet to be &#8216;mainstreamed&#8217; throughout delivery of public policy.&#8221;</p><p>Paragraph 471 indicates that there is still a huge job to be done, in that</p><p>&#8220;the message at community level is that they don&#8217;t feel truly part of the decision making process, and that regeneration is &#8216;done to them&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>Communities must be given opportunities and, crucially, they must feel that they are fully involved in all aspects of regeneration activity, from the initial ideas, through to identification of priorities and projects, and on to implementation and completion. They must feel that they have a voice and that that voice is being listened to at all times.</p><p>Regeneration is about people. The best people to take decisions about an area are the people who live and work in that area, wherever it is. No one else knows as much about their priorities and challenges, and no one else cares as much about getting those decisions right. That is why we must have strong community involvement in any decision-making process or in any organisation that is dealing with regeneration.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s inquiry was fascinating. At the same time, however, it highlighted a number of issues relating to the general feeling among communities that they are not involved in what is happening. The work that the committee has undertaken will help the country in the future, so I am delighted to be a member of the committee that produced that piece of work.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, {"date": "2014-05-15", "body": "<p>Will the member take an intervention?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Homecoming Scotland 2014"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14060.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14060", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Stuart McMillan", "member_id": "80536", "entered_house": "2011-05-06", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "West Scotland"}, {"left_reason": "regional_election", "first_name": "Stuart", "last_name": "McMillan", "left_house": "2011-03-23", "title": "", "house": "4", "image": "/images/mpsL/14060.png", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:31:31", "image_width": 98, "person_id": "14060", "entered_reason": "regional_election", "image_height": 118, "full_name": "Stuart McMillan", "member_id": "80360", "entered_house": "2007-05-03", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "West of Scotland"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Annabel", "last_name": "Goldie", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>This is an important day for this Parliament because, whatever the outcome of the referendum, this Parliament will change.</p><p>When we meet again in this chamber after 18 September, Scotland will have decided her future. Either she will have rejected the United Kingdom and endorsed separation, or she will have rejected separation and endorsed the United Kingdom. It is right that, in this place of all places, we mark today the magnitude of that decision by holding this debate.</p><p>It is important to be clear about what the referendum is not about. It is not about whether Scotland can be independent. It can be. It is not about whether we are doing down independence or talking up the union. It is quite simply about what is the better future for Scotland. It is not about whether one likes or dislikes Tories, Labour or the Lib Dems, however much some of the yes campaign might want to reduce it to that.</p><p>The referendum is certainly not about who is the better Scot or the bigger patriot. We all believe in our country, we all love our country and we are all fighting for what we believe is the best future for Scotland. Alex Salmond believes that separation is patriotic. I believe that partnership is patriotic. It is very importantly that the referendum is not a choice between independence and no change.

The case for staying within the United Kingdom is so compelling and so self-evident that brevity is all that I need. It is a partnership of over 60&#160;million friends and customers, working with each other for each other; a partnership with over 30&#160;million people paying taxes and contributing jointly to our common good; and a partnership in which businesses, not least in the financial sector, can invest and operate freely because of a UK-wide system of regulation. It is a partnership that, in a global age, gives us a global reach, in the United Nations, the G7 and G8 groups of major powers and in the EU, which allows us to help those who are less fortunate; a partnership that, in an age of international uncertainty, gives us a strategic defence capability and a global diplomatic presence; and a partnership that has an established, proven and respected currency&#8212;the pound. In all of those are strength, stability and security.</p><p>Alex Salmond does not want that. He wants separation: an irrevocable and irreversible step. There are two certainties about Alex Salmond, and I am sorry that he is not here to hear this paean of praise. The first is his passion and enthusiasm for what he wants, and the second is his complete and utter inability to tell the rest of us what we will get. What will be our currency? He does not know. Will we have a central bank to support it? He does not know. When will we get into the European Union? He does not know. What conditions will be imposed on Scotland&#8217;s EU membership? He does not know. How will we pay the pensions of an increasingly ageing population? He does not know. How many thousands of defence jobs in Scotland will be lost? He does not know.

According to a poll, 41 per cent of people agree that, if Scotland becomes independent, Britain&#8217;s nuclear weapon submarines should continue to be based here and 37 per cent want them to go elsewhere, so the Government does not even have a unanimity of position within Scotland.</p><p>As I have said before, nuclear weapons have an awesome capacity for destruction and they are expensive, but for the moment they are necessary.

The defence sector is a hugely important part of Scotland&#8217;s industry, employing more than 12,600 people in highly skilled, high-value jobs in areas such as design, manufacture, assembly and maintenance.

What a joyous three weeks it has been for every Glaswegian.</p><p>Even as the bunting still flew and the cheers died, I could not help but reflect that the Commonwealth returned to Glasgow to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the commencement of the first world war. Let us not forget that Glasgow and Scotland contributed disproportionately to the British effort in that war and to the sacrifice that was endured. How apposite was it that, 100 years later, instead of our finest leaving Glasgow and Scotland to fight on the battlefields of France, they were competing on the sporting battlefields of our home city&#8212;the second city of that now long-forgotten empire.</p><p>As I watched the lawn bowls at Kelvingrove, I also thought that behind that sporting arena there stood the legacy of a previous international exhibition in Glasgow, in 1901, which was itself paid for by the international exhibition of 1888, to which 5.8 million people came. In 1938, Glasgow hosted the empire exhibition, to which 12.5 million people came over that year. I remember, as a schoolboy, looking at the pictures of that exhibition, which was meant to be a celebration of empire but instead was a celebration of technological advance, with pavilions that reminded me then of Walter Pigeon, the movie &#8220;Forbidden Planet&#8221; and the Dan Dare comics. I only wished that I had been able to attend that exhibition. Its hopes were, of course, cruelly dashed within months as we went to war.</p><p>I recall vividly the garden festival in Glasgow that took place 50 years later, to which 4.3 million people came&#8212;40 per cent more than were anticipated. I remember the Coca-Cola ride, the Clydesdale Bank tower&#8212;which worked rather more efficiently than its successor&#8212;the Bell&#8217;s bridge, the Mactaggart &amp; Mickel milk bar and the rotundas that were brought back into the life of the city at that time.</p><p>I also remember the year of culture in 1990, with 10,000 performances to which some 9 million visitors came. I sang along to &#8220;Nessun dorma&#8221; with Pavarotti and crooned along to songs with Frank Sinatra at Ibrox. I remember saying, as the band left the stage, that Mr Sinatra did not do encores. However, that was one of the very few occasions in his career when he came back and did one, such had been the welcome that he had received from Glasgow. He sang &#8220;Summer Wind&#8221; in a dinner suit that was soaked because of the Glasgow summer rains.</p><p>I mention all of that both to point to Glasgow&#8217;s ability, throughout its long history, to rise to the occasion, whatever its difficulties&#8212;we still have terrible public health difficulties in Glasgow&#8212;whenever one of these big events is presented to it and to dwell on the concept of legacy. Given the success of those great exhibitions and other events, why was it ever in doubt that Glasgow could host the Commonwealth games? I do not know. It is interesting that those other exhibitions and events were directed foremost to the rest of the United Kingdom whereas what was unique about this event is that Glasgow sold itself to the rest of the world&#8212;and the rest of the world came. What did they find? They found that they had family, friends and neighbours who were already living in the city of Glasgow. For my money, it is the most harmonious, integrated and multicultural city in the United Kingdom. Glasgow has a tremendous track record of welcoming people not as strangers but as family when they come to the city to participate in and enjoy these great events. There is talk of our bidding for the Euro football championships at a future date&#8212;I hope that we do and that we have the same success.</p><p>The legacy is not to be measured in bricks and mortar. Of the old exhibition, only the Kelvin Hall and the Glasgow museum remain. I once went looking for the buildings of the 1938 empire exhibition and, when I found one, I tried to read what the sign said. My wife was bewildered because when I read it out, I said &#8220;LACE O FART&#8221;. She pointed out to me that, if the missing letters were restored, it would say &#8220;PALACE OF ART&#8221;. It took me some time to work that out. The legacy of the Commonwealth games will be measured not in bricks and mortar but in the confidence and stride of the city&#8212;in the energy, passion, commitment and goodwill that we bring to ensuring that the legacy of the games is in tackling the public health record of the city of Glasgow. I came back to the games from Switzerland, where I had patted myself on the back for going up in a cable car, enjoying a very nice lunch and walking down the hill only to find Swiss families and their children walking up the hill, passing me on the way. Too often, we take the easy option, whether it is the lift in the Parliament building or the soft rather than the physically unattractive route.

I am not a big fan of mascots, but Clyde certainly captured the heart of the city and I hope that he can continue to play a part in it. I also thank the 10 people who hosted the Clyde costume, including Brian Borland, who, I was delighted to see, was given a UK points of light award for his efforts by the Prime Minister. Of course, the legacy exists in the medals for individuals, families and communities that are too numerous to name, as well as in the golden cone on top of the Wellington statue that Glasgow has instead of golden postboxes. Surely, that represents an award for the people of Glasgow&#8212;all the volunteers, the organisers, the public services and the armed forces.</p><p>I thank three politicians: Jack McConnell, for his inspiration in bringing the games to the city; Sir John Major, whom I was delighted to see at the gymnastics event, who instituted the national lottery, which gave a generation of young athletes the consistency of sustained funding in their sports&#8212;the reward for that must have given him great pride; and the cabinet secretary. She has had to wait many years for the success to unfold.

I have to say that my fears were largely well founded. I would not apply these adjectives to the cabinet secretary but to her motion, which is tawdry, sour, full of rancid SNP polemic and thoroughly depressing, as has been much of the debate, notwithstanding contributions that I much appreciated from Nanette Milne, Ken Macintosh, Aileen McLeod&#8212;until the polemic at the end&#8212;Fiona McLeod and Hugh Henry.</p><p>We have commented first on the fact that we celebrate old people, which is referred to at the beginning of the motion and is something on which we can all agree. We have had various pensioner contributions during the debate. As I pointed out in a previous debate, when the Parliament first assembled in 1999 only eight members were aged 60 or over but at the present time over 45 members are aged 60 or over. The Parliament is a reflection of the wider society in its ageing.</p><p>I listened to Shona Robison&#8217;s rebuttal of Neil Findlay, but as I understood it the logic of her point seemed to be that if Scotland had been independent there would have been, uniquely in the western world, no deindustrialisation in Scotland&#8212;it would not have happened. Nor, when I hear Bob Doris and others go on about the new pension commitment, do I ever remember the SNP talking about reducing the pensionable age in Scotland because we had a different life expectancy. No, the great idea that we are going to have a variable pension age has popped into the public lexicon only because we have a referendum in prospect and the SNP sees it as something that it can dangle before the electorate in an illusive, bribery way.</p><p>When I was born, people expected to live about 11 years in retirement, but today it is about half as much again. I think that most people understand that, if we are going to have a much larger and wider base of people surviving into old age, we need to place that on a sustainable financial footing and, however much we might wish it to be otherwise, that requires the pension age to be reviewed.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Older People"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>As I said to the cabinet secretary, she could have been arguing that for the past 30 years as a reason for reducing the pension age in Scotland, but she has not done so.</p><p>Surely the point in all of this is whether people are going to live well and be healthy in old age and live in appropriate housing. Those two points have been touched on in the debate, and I will touch on them in my own way.</p><p>First, in relation to living well, that means that we must ensure that the healthcare that is going to keep people fit and independent into old age is readily available. In that regard, let us talk about atrial fibrillation, which I think Margaret McCulloch has asked the Government questions on. Atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia that is present in around 1 per cent of the population and characterised by an irregular heartbeat and associated with symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, breathlessness and dizziness. Its prevalence is strongly associated with age, with more than 8 per cent of people aged 65 or over having it and 85 per cent of people who have it being aged 65 or over.</p><p>The condition is becoming more common, it is associated with an elderly population, and, if not properly treated, it compromises the standard of living and ability to act independently of those old people, and yet the drug that is now available&#8212;despite having been approved by the Scottish Medicines Consortium&#8212;is only being prescribed on a variable ratio across Scotland. As Margaret McCulloch established, on average, only 0.05 per cent of the Scottish population is being prescribed that drug.</p><p>That all suggests that if we are going to have a health service that is appropriate and competent for elderly people, one thing that we have to look at is providing something that is more streamlined, appropriate, rapid and free-thinking. We currently have too many health boards and too many health medical prescribing committees.</p><p>The second point is on housing, which Hugh Henry touched on. Mr Macintosh contributed to the debate. He represents the constituency of Eastwood, which is sometimes known as Eastwood twinned with McCarthy and Stone, because it has such a high concentration of McCarthy and Stone facilities. Indeed, when I first stood for election there, I established that there were 63 residential homes for old people in the constituency. I went round them all and I have to say that there were some that I did not want to find myself in and others that I very much hoped I might find myself in. I did notice that very few of the homes had men, full stop. It does seem that men do not live as long as women&#8212;indeed, Carlaw men are not long lived at all, so I am completely altruistic about all this because I do not expect to be the beneficiary of anything about which I speak.</p><p>We need to think about the accommodation that we are going to provide for older people in this next great age of life. I have touched on that point in previous debates and Hugh Henry talked about it earlier. Of course, not everybody will be able to go into a McCarthy and Stone facility&#8212;they seem to be inordinately expensive to me. We will have to ensure that people are able to live within their communities.</p><p>In East Renfrewshire at the moment, there is a proposal to build a huge retirement village on the outskirts of Newton Mearns. I am not altogether sure whether it is for the benefit of those who will live there or for the benefit of those who will manage, run and profit from it, but that is a separate issue. The question is: do we want to create communities into which old people are put, or do we want to ensure that older people are able to stay within the communities in which they have lived?</p><p>If we accept that people are going to live longer and will want to stay within their community and have an independent lifestyle, we must ensure not only that we have a health service that is capable of allowing them to stay independent and healthy but that we start planning now so that the residential accommodation that we build in the future will provide both the sheltered housing that Mr Henry talked about and appropriate accommodation within the community that will enable elderly people to live independently.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Older People"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>Unfortunately, this ended up as yet another debate that referenced everything to the referendum.

The levers to tackle unemployment, underemployment and lack of training and educational opportunities are already available to the Scottish Government. We should ensure that we are using them all, because the barriers faced by women entering the labour market are varied and complex, and the Scottish Government has recognised that fact. I may not agree that it needs independence to improve women&#8217;s life chances, but I agree that we must ensure that every woman has the chance to enter the labour market or education should she so wish.</p><p>For many women it is about childcare; for others it is about being able to find a place on a college course, in their local area, that will provide them with the skills that employers are looking for. The challenges to achieving that faced by women may vary depending on whether they live in an urban area or in the countryside.</p><p>Fife Gingerbread and the Poverty Alliance have carried out work on the challenges that are faced by single mothers in rural areas and I have previously highlighted their excellent report into poverty and lone parenthood. In that report, the women who were interviewed consistently referred to the challenges of finding suitable childcare and the barriers that that presented to them accessing not just employment but college courses.</p><p>Given the attention that has been given to childcare in recent months, that is not surprising news. Indeed, many of the issues that are relevant to increasing opportunities for women were explored during the passage of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill. However, it is clear to me from the feedback that I have had from parents and childcare providers across Mid Scotland and Fife that the number of hours of childcare is not the be all and end all of the debate. If those hours are not available at a time that suits them, families will not be able to access the support that is required to enable women to participate in education, training or employment. Many families are forced to either juggle their local authority provision with support from a childminder or family members or use a private nursery that may be more able to meet their hours.</p><p>Interestingly, the report &#8220;Growing Up in Scotland: Characteristics of pre-school provision and their association with child outcomes&#8221; picked up on that point. It noted that the use of private childcare providers increased with income and that</p><p>&#8220;just 7% of children from households in the lowest income group attended a private provider compared with 24% of children from households in the highest income group. These differences largely reflect the different childcare needs of couple families with both parents employed.&#8221;</p><p>For those who do not have an extended family network or are not in a two-parent family, it is vital that we see an increase in provision of more flexible, wraparound childcare&#8212;whether that is breakfast clubs, after-school clubs, provision during school holidays or extended opening hours.</p><p>We have seen the same old argument time and again from the Scottish Government: post-independence, all will be well. That ignores the fact that many of the issues that it focuses on can already be addressed by the Government under powers that it already has.</p><p>The importance of college provision in increasing opportunities for women, especially those from our most deprived communities, is inarguable. That is why it is hugely concerning that the Scottish Government&#8217;s cuts to college courses have disproportionately affected women. Warm words from ministers today are all very well, but in our communities the negative consequences of the Government&#8217;s choices are all too clear.</p><p>Occupational segregation in vocational training and apprenticeships has been raised by the Wood commission and in a recent report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The EHRC found evidence of men increasingly moving into traditionally female apprenticeship programmes but no evidence of an overall increase of women entering traditionally male apprenticeships. Women make up 3 per cent of engineering apprenticeships, which is a shockingly small figure that shows that the problems are systemic throughout society. Girls&#8217; attitudes to STEM subjects and society&#8217;s condoning of gender-stereotyped roles for young women is a huge problem that needs challenged.</p><p>The EHRC also found that there is a significant gendered spend on apprenticeships in Scotland, with spend per male apprentice being 53 per cent higher than that for female apprentices, which is deeply concerning. The Scottish Government has the power to act on that immediately, and I urge it to do so.</p><p>We may argue about how best to improve women&#8217;s participation in non-traditional areas of education and employment and I welcome innovative ideas to target that problem. However, it is clear to me&#8212;and I hope many others&#8212;that constitutional change will not tackle the structural inequality of our society, which can hugely influence the economic opportunities open to women. It is therefore disappointing that the Scottish Government chose to bring forward this debate under its usual mantle of saying that independence will solve everything.</p><p>I fully support proposals to increase opportunities for women, but I want opportunities to increase throughout Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.

I also congratulate Buglife and the Scottish Wildlife Trust on their consistent work in highlighting the importance of the pollinator population to maintaining the biodiversity of our countryside and our urban environments.</p><p>We have learned how vital pollinators such as bees, hoverflies and other insects are to our ecosystems and what an essential part of the food chain they are. The loss of pollinators and the potential impact on the food supply for humans as well as wildlife is quite daunting, and it is easy to feel powerless in the face of such devastating statistics. Yes, we must take precautionary steps such as banning neonicotinoids, as the EU has done for the next two years, but we must also have measures in place that support habitats and rebuild pollinator populations.</p><p>Among the worrying developments of the past few years and the decreasing pollinator population, it has been especially heartening to see the simple contributions that every person can make to improving and increasing the habitats of pollinators. Buglife&#8217;s campaign to get Britain buzzing is a great example of that, and I am pleased to see it getting the recognition that it deserves in today&#8217;s debate.</p><p>The Parliament has considered biodiversity previously and, during my time on the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, I have welcomed the opportunity to participate in debates on the topic. Looking back to my contributions on the issue, I note that I highlighted the huge range of biodiversity in Fife and the excellent work being carried out by projects across the region, including at Lochore meadows. Of course, many other projects across Mid Scotland and Fife are helping to lead the fight back for our pollinator populations. Fleecefaulds meadow wildlife reserve near Ceres in Fife benefits from the wonderfully named flying flock of sheep, which the Scottish Wildlife Trust uses to manage grasslands across Scotland through conservation grazing.</p><p>In mentioning bugs, bees and even sheep, it would be remiss of me not to mention the brown long-eared bat, as I am the proud species champion for that great wee creature. We need to remember how it and many other species are reliant on a healthy population of pollinators and a diverse range of habitats. The Bat Conservation Trust has highlighted how important wildlife corridors can be for bats and other creatures by linking up different habitats across Scotland&#8217;s landscape.</p><p>It is not just the environmental importance of pollinators that has been calculated. Impressively, the Scottish Wildlife Trust has been able to quantify the economic impact of pollinators on the economy, which is estimated to be at least &#163;43 million annually in Scotland alone. It is not just our agricultural and food sector that is reliant on a diverse and healthy pollinator population&#8212;given the importance of Scotland&#8217;s landscape to our visitors, the tourism sector should surely be considered, too.</p><p>We know that the threat to biodiversity from the loss of pollinators crosses borders, so I am pleased that the UK Environmental Audit Committee has strongly voiced its concerns about the reservations of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs over the European Commission&#8217;s ban on neonicotinoid pesticides. I welcome the precautionary principle that the EU has followed on the matter and I am interested in hearing from the minister about the Scottish Government&#8217;s view on making the ban permanent once the EU temporary ban has lapsed.

I am privileged to represent Mid Scotland and Fife, so I am spoilt for choice, given the wealth of sites on which I could focus, from ancient buildings and monuments across the region to more recent examples, such as the category B-listed fire station in Dunfermline. The building is soon to be reborn as a community arts centre, which will operate as a social enterprise with support from the council and other funders.</p><p>In previous debates I have talked about the Isle of May, with its 8,000 years of human habitation, and the more recent history of Lochore village, where the local landscape has seen changes from agriculture to coal mining and burning bings and is now home to the peaceful, secret gem that is Lochore Meadows country park.</p><p>Members&#8217; pride in their areas points to a key issue, which was raised in the committee report: the importance of continuing the regional approach that Historic Scotland is currently pursuing and supporting sites of interest in local communities. The cabinet secretary provided an assurance that the establishment of the new body will not mean a move to a more centralised approach to decision making. However, I particularly support the committee&#8217;s recommendation that the bill underpin the regional approach in some way. Perhaps the cabinet secretary will consider the matter as the bill progresses.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary and her colleagues will know from recent questions that I have asked, I have a strong interest in community planning. I believe that community participation and ownership are fundamental to successfully delivering outcomes at a local level and that that should cut across all areas of Government.</p><p>Local people care about their local heritage and local environment. The energy, expertise and commitment from local communities cannot be replicated by Governments or other agencies, and we sometimes do not adequately acknowledge or value it. We cannot put a price on civic pride. That local drive and energy is often the thing that can bring communities together, helping to bring in the funding and ensuring that the historic environment continues to be relevant now and in the future. The importance of community planning partnerships in that context has been highlighted by the Royal Town Planning Institute, and I look forward to seeing its recommendations as part of the historic environment group.</p><p>The presence of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities on the historic environment group demonstrates the recognition of the important role of local authorities in planning matters and the built environment. As the report highlights, evidence to the committee suggested that 92 per cent of archaeological assets fall within the remit of planning authorities as they are not explicitly labelled as scheduled monuments. The report highlights concerns about the remit of the new body in overseeing the historic environment, and I would welcome further clarification from the minister on that.</p><p>We know that it is not just sites of archaeological interest that are covered by the proposed legislation; it also includes properties in care and listed buildings, reflecting the diversity of the historic environment across the country.</p><p>In supporting the general principles of the bill&#8212;and although some aspects are particularly process driven given the nature of the legislation&#8212;we must remember the most important outcome, which is to successfully protect and manage our diverse historic environment for future generations.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>In response to a question last week on the proposed Levenmouth rail link, the minister suggested that neither he nor Transport Scotland had had any contact from Fife Council regarding the proposal.</p><p>The leader of Fife Council wrote to the minister on 28 May, and the Scottish Government acknowledged the letter. Can the minister now correct the record and acknowledge that Fife Council has made representations on the matter?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Transport Scotland (Meetings)"}, {"date": "2014-06-12", "body": "<p>I thank Elaine Smith for securing today&#8217;s debate and for her years of campaigning to encourage and support breastfeeding in Scotland, particularly of course by bringing forward the Breastfeeding etc (Scotland) Act 2005.</p><p>I am proud that there have been a number of other progressive advances in legislation and policy over the years to support increases in breastfeeding rates. Today, most women who give birth in Scotland know about the multiple benefits that breastfeeding brings and most of them intend to breastfeed their baby. However, that good news is tempered by the fact that overall breastfeeding rates are static and by the National Childbirth Trust research that shows the high rate of mothers who stop breastfeeding or move to mixed feeding before they want to.</p><p>The policy on educating expectant parents about the benefits of breastfeeding seems to be working, but it is just one part of the story. Unless the policy is situated in a culture that actively supports, understands and enables breastfeeding, it will remain stunted in its potential to transform breastfeeding initiation rates and the length of time for which mothers breastfeed. Further progress on employment practice, childcare arrangements and effective support networks will help to bring about the change, but we also need to face up to persisting attitudes towards women&#8217;s bodies and choices.</p><p>I would like to say that it is incredible that a woman such as Emily Slough can be labelled a &#8220;tramp&#8221; for breastfeeding her child in a public place, but then we live in a society that plasters boobs everywhere in a sexual context, where women&#8217;s bodies are reduced to an image that society at large can appropriate for comment and criticism, and where mothers feel exposed and judged on a daily basis. Although we are getting better at telling mothers about the benefits of breastfeeding and providing support for it, we are falling short at speaking to people more widely.</p><p>The debate is an important part of the discussion on how we tackle negative attitudes towards not just breastfeeding but women more generally. Elaine Smith&#8217;s suggestion about promoting the legislation across the country is entirely sensible, for new mothers need to know that they live in a country that supports breastfeeding not only in theory but in practice. That demands a multifaceted approach. The more people see breastfeeding in public, the more normal breastfeeding will become&#8212;and the more normal it becomes, the more people will feel that they can breastfeed in public.</p><p>While we work on changing attitudes more generally, we can work within the space that we have to get more women breastfeeding. That is precisely what is happening in Fife. We know that the women who are least likely to breastfeed are younger women and women who live in low-income areas. NHS Fife&#8217;s breastfeeding peer support project has driven up breastfeeding in deprived areas, and all Fife&#8217;s community health partnerships have just been awarded the UNICEF stage 3 award.</p><p>The team in Fife recognises that many women feel embarrassed and unsure about breastfeeding in public, even though that is unfair, so it provides a guide for new parents that lists public places in Fife that actively support breastfeeding. The more mums do it, the more it will seem like the thing to do. That will change the culture over time.</p><p>Fife knows that the only approach that works is one that puts the mother at the centre. That is why it is crucial that initiatives such as the breastfeeding peer support project continue to receive direct funding from Government.</p><p>Women who breastfeed in public should not have to cover up or apologise. A woman who breastfeeds should not be seen as a &#8220;tramp&#8221; or as a pushy middle-class mum; she should be seen as a person feeding another little person. It really is that simple.</p><p>I think that most people in Scotland recognise that it is in everyone&#8217;s interests that infants receive the nutrition that gives them the very best start in life. It is our collective responsibility to address attitudes towards breastfeeding, not just in expectant couples but in society at large.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Breastfeeding"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>Given the contribution that the public, community, voluntary and private sectors can make to achieving our targets, does the minister see a role for community planning partnerships in taking forward the work and engaging with all the stakeholders?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Greenhouse Gas Inventory 2012"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>Can the minister reassure the Parliament that the mechanisms are in place to ensure that the Scottish Government and partners are able to assess how to adapt and respond to the needs at hand and to new research as it arises, as argued by Scottish Environment LINK?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme"}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "body": "<p>I thank the Scottish Government for bringing forward this debate on an issue that is rightly at the forefront of minds across the chamber.</p><p>I would also like to make the minister aware that, like my Labour colleagues, I have a degree, but I gained it as a mum who was working full time. I went to Napier College, which became a university while I was there. I am very grateful for the opportunities that I got at the college, and I probably would not be here today if I had not got that chance in life and the chance to work really hard.</p><p>In that sense, it makes me even more disappointed that only higher education is mentioned in the motion. I think that that flags up a little bit of the SNP attitude toward Scotland&#8217;s colleges that has delivered unprecedented cuts in college budgets and therefore to opportunities for progression for people like me, particularly those who are returning to the workforce, upskilling or from traditionally marginalised groups. As my colleague Neil Bibby has outlined, the current decisions made by Governments in both Holyrood and Westminster have resulted in drastically fewer foreign students attending our colleges, which has a numerical and financial impact on them that is much greater than that on our elite universities.</p><p>With the caveat that I think that we should be talking about much more than just higher education in the debate, I will speak to several interrelated points for the rest of my time.</p><p>The first point is that I share the Scottish Government&#8217;s concerns about the impact of the current Conservative immigration policy. In particular, I am concerned about including students within the blanket immigration cap. That policy treats all legal immigration in the same way&#8212;as something bad for Britain that should be reduced&#8212;and that is wrong. I and the Labour Party strongly believe that it is deeply damaging to the UK&#8217;s diversity and economy that the number of fee-paying overseas students has fallen at a time when the international market for universities in comparable countries is growing. That is why university students should be removed entirely from the net migration target.</p><p>Secondly, I want to emphasise that, as always, changing the constitution is not the way to solve those problems. In this area of trying to achieve social justice, erecting a border is not the place to start or end. The solution is to elect a Government for the whole UK that is committed to exempting university students from any net migration target and creating a managed system that is in Britain&#8217;s interests. It just so happens that we have a political party that can do that in 2015. We do not need independence to implement positive policies that make allowances for Scotland&#8217;s differences while allowing us to remain part of a strong partnership in research and teaching.</p><p>In the past, we have created schemes in which we have co-operated, rather than simply take pointed stances against the UK Government. Indeed, the Government&#8217;s motion states that</p><p>&#8220;a post-study work visa scheme ... is needed to meet Scotland&#8217;s educational, social and economic ambitions.&#8221;</p><p>I could not agree more that such a programme can work, but where I differ from the Government is that I know that such a system can work under devolution because we saw one implemented in Scotland in 2005&#8212;the fresh talent initiative&#8212;following the kind of co-operation between the UK and Scottish Governments that I have been talking about. The fresh talent scheme was continued until 2008, when it became such a success that it was rolled out across the entire UK. Sadly, however, it was withdrawn by the Conservatives in 2012.</p><p>When we have Governments that are willing to engage with each other and co-operate, we can ensure, as we emphasised in our devolution commission, that we properly account for distinct Scottish needs. We see in other countries, too, allowances being made for different areas within them&#8212;for example, there are such systems in Australia and Canada. In our devolution commission report, we identified that there are some barriers to setting up such schemes but that we ultimately believe that reasoned and agreed variations between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom are justifiable and workable. The fresh talent scheme has shown us that the way forward is through co-operation. It is up to the Scottish Government to show that it is willing to agree.</p><p>My third point is one that the SNP should reflect on, as it is crucial to its proposed immigration and higher education policy. All the discussion in the debate has focused on international migration, but the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals on the international and EU fee situation post-independence have been particularly doubted by many.</p><p>I find it shocking that a Government that paints itself as open, egalitarian and wishing to co-operate with the rest of the UK post-separation is happy to discriminate against those from one specific other state. Our nation&#8217;s most respected academics, including the chair of European Union law at the University of Edinburgh, have lined up to criticise the white paper&#8217;s failure</p><p>&#8220;to unpack the layered system of derogation and justification&#8221;.</p><p>The legal test is not simply an attempt to show objective justification as some SNP members would have us believe. Rather, the newly independent Government would have to show that its policy was not directly discriminatory. Direct discrimination simply cannot be justified by any objective justification; it is a much narrower set of derogations that are allowed.</p><p>The Scottish Government has not even attempted to engage in debate on what derogations it may seek following independence, and because the residence requirements that are outlined target only those from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, it seems that even the objective justifications that Mr Russell has outlined in the past rest on a shoogly peg. The European Court has only once accepted&#8212;in the case of Bressol and others&#8212;that a member state may limit access to university courses, and even then it was in specific circumstances that related to public health, and not on cost grounds. The idea that blanket treatment for residents of a single member state would be found proportionate is frankly a little far-fetched, and it is unfair for the Government not to face up to that major challenge before September.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Immigration Policy (Higher Education)"}, {"date": "2014-05-28", "body": "<p></p><p>15.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has predicted a significant rise in child poverty in Scotland by 2020. The issue has not gone away for parents and carers, who have to juggle on a daily basis the challenges, responsibilities and commitments of family life, which include ensuring that they have access to good-quality and reliable childcare. Until that is delivered, the issue cannot go away for all of us in the chamber.</p><p>As anyone who has brought up children will know, it is not just the cost that matters when one is looking at childcare options. Families have to build their childcare around their work patterns and the availability of nurseries, childminders or day care in their local area. Crucially, we must consider wraparound care for school-age children, which has been missed in the current debates. If there is more than one child, there can be further complications with getting the children to where they need to be. That all adds time to the working day.</p><p>A nursery or childcare provider whose hours do not match the requirements of the main carers, whether because of work patterns or other reasons, will be of no use at all, no matter how high quality or affordable the provision. I know from listening to parents that decisions on childcare options sometimes have to be based around what is available, whether that is friends, family or voluntary, private or public sector provision, rather than what is perhaps best suited to the child&#8217;s or family&#8217;s circumstances. If any parent or carer who is in employment is asked, they will give a long list of childcare options that are turned to, depending on the circumstances. There will be childminders who take the children to and from school or nursery, or a day care centre, or combinations of those options. I speak from experience when I say that there can also be the emergency phone call to granny, asking her to step in when other options have been exhausted.</p><p>Flexibility and truly quality childcare can tackle significant inequalities in development and support working parents. For many families, the list of options may be limited due to financial or other circumstances, which is why it is vital that childcare provision in Scotland in the future is affordable and flexible in meeting the needs of all parents and carers.</p><p>As we all know, it is more than three months since the Scottish Parliament passed the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014. It offered real positives for young people but, as colleagues have already pointed out, it remains an act over which some very large financial question marks loom. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of Opposition parties, the Finance Committee and third sector bodies, a number of questions remain over the costs of the childcare commitments that the Scottish Government outlined.</p><p>The questions are not just about childcare. Whether because of the absence of financial modelling data or because of the lack of an update on the revised capital costs in the financial memorandum, which the Finance Committee is still awaiting, other question marks loom over the financial implications of 2014 act.</p><p>I have raised before my concerns about the delay in the publication of the financial review of kinship care. The Scottish Government promised to publish the review&#8217;s findings the end of 2013. It is crucial that kinship carers, who provide a vital role in caring for our children, are offered some financial security, but we are still waiting for the review&#8217;s findings to be published. I hope that we will hear some indication from the Scottish Government of when the review will be published, as kinship carers play an essential part in providing love, care and security for many of Scotland&#8217;s children. We must not forget the need to make those vital foundations secure before we build on the basic blocks of family life with other early learning and childcare opportunities.</p><p>It is clear that the quality of childcare is fundamental. The new definition of early learning and childcare, as set out in the 2014 act, is to be welcomed, as it recognises the crucial educational aspects of looking after children. I have raised in other debates the issue of opportunities for all children and the impact that a good-quality start can have on their life chances. That point is all the more stark now, as we hear from Save the Children that a quarter of all children live in families who are in relative poverty. Three quarters of those children are under 11, and they are at greater risk of poverty than those in any other section of society&#8212;a damning fact.</p><p>Although there is no silver bullet, we must come together to ensure that quality, flexible and affordable childcare offers children a route away from their persistent poor situations. It is absolutely vital to remember that, for too many children and young people, access to opportunities is bound up in a tangled web of poverty-related issues, including housing, food and nutrition, access to transport and opportunities for play, all of which impact on their health, education, interaction with peers and educational attainment.</p><p>Save the Children has shown that children living in poverty are twice as likely to be born underweight, three times more likely to have poor diets, nearly four times more likely not to have access to nutritious food, five times more likely to live in poor-quality housing and seven times more likely to live in households that are in fuel poverty. In addition, the education gap starts to open up long before school even begins, with the result that children who grow up in poverty finish school with significantly lower levels of attainment, which limits their opportunities throughout life.</p><p>As much as a single change can begin to make a difference, providing flexible and quality childcare is that change. Our long-term vision for childcare in Scotland must tackle the crucial issues. However, it is a long-term vision that is in danger of being cynically used as a carrot by those pushing constitutional arguments without the facts and figures to support their proposals. Whatever the outcome of the referendum in September, the need for high-quality childcare will remain. It is an issue that we all know is well within the powers of this Parliament to consider now and in the future. We do not need independence to improve the lives of Scotland&#8217;s children.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-05-14", "body": "<p>I thank the Scottish Government for holding this debate on the &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; strategy. For generations, the arts, alongside education, have been the great equaliser, which have allowed people to prosper on merit and on talent rather than by their background. The benefits of that go beyond making a career in the arts. Taking part in an artistic pursuit allows a young person to grow and to develop skills&#8212;the soft skills that we talk about so much&#8212;which stand them in good stead for later life.</p><p>I note that the substantive recommendations of the report total only two pages. I look forward to hearing more about the detail. For contrast, the Northern Irish equivalent, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland&#8217;s &#8220;Youth Arts Strategy 2013 - 2017&#8221;, totals more than 30,000 words, including eight pages examining our system here in Scotland. It is an analysis of the Northern Irish cultural situation in comparative perspective, and it is perhaps something that we could have pursued further.</p><p>Although I will welcome many of the aspects of the &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; strategy in my speech, I wish that the Government had provided more information about how the initiatives will take shape over the two years, and especially about how the strategy&#8217;s goals will interact with the curriculum for excellence.</p><p>In Fife, a participative approach is being taken to developing the arts. Having listened to feedback from children, Fife Council has recently approved a match-funding agreement, working alongside voluntary organisations and charitable trusts, to further the work of the ground-breaking Alhambra theatre in Dunfermline. The theatre now employs a dedicated youth development officer. It has doubled the capacity of its annual summer stage school and is maintaining regular drama classes, which will support 180 young people every week.</p><p>The Alhambra&#8217;s focus is entirely on promoting confidence, teamwork, equality and social skills among young people. Crucially, its classes are entirely flexible to fit in with the varying ways of life of different young people across Fife. That is the perfect example of how the arts should be supported by government. We should be working in partnership with organisations that are already rooted in our communities, rather than adopting a top-down approach with rigid guidelines. I am glad that the Scottish Government&#8217;s &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; strategy reflects my concerns in this regard and that it gives a lot of leeway to groups to shape their own strategy.</p><p>I will talk a little about the value of musical tuition. My own area, Fife, has a long-standing tradition of supporting youth orchestras and groups, and I hope that the proposed national youth arts consortium will offer a way of sharing that expertise with other areas.</p><p>One of my proudest moments as a councillor was when I was present for a performance by the Kelty and Blairadam pipe band at the highland games in Pitlochry. It was through tailored support from Fife Council that those young people were able to get the tuition and mentoring that enabled them to perform on a national stage. I am glad to see that local authorities will be key partners of the youth arts hub, as the experience and knowledge that they can provide is truly valuable.</p><p>Recently I have learned of the work of pioneering organisations such Create at Cloud, which is based in Dunfermline and which does excellent work in supporting young people&#8217;s involvement in new creative industries such as film production. As that demonstrates, culture is no longer static; it is inherently interactive, and I will closely follow the Government&#8217;s exploration of how technology can be used to further engagement with the arts. I note the aim to set up a national digital platform, and again I look forward to seeing the detail on the exact role that that will play in furthering the cultural offering for young people in Scotland.</p><p>I am also glad to see that national bodies such as Theatre Workshop Scotland will be included as partners of the youth arts hubs across the country. Theatre Workshop Scotland produced the excellent &#8220;The Happy Lands&#8221; film in Fife with support from Creative Scotland through the national lottery, with funding from Fife Council, and in association with BBC Scotland. I visited the set of the film and was struck by the range of skills and experience which local people of all ages were having the chance to show. As well as performance skills, local people were involved in technical and production skills such as set building, make-up and costumes. It was a great experience for everyone who took part, and they produced a film that went on to be successful on the world stage.</p><p>The skeletal proposals to establish an arts award scheme and a national mentoring programme are to be welcomed, and I am sure that members will join me in supporting the Scottish Government proposals that should have social mobility and equality at their core. I hope that the Scottish Government ensures that those programmes will work together to properly concentrate support where it will provide the most benefit. I also call on the Government to ensure that any roles that are created through the new youth employment initiative are paid roles to make sure that they are available to all. I am sure that I have the support of many members in making a call on the Government to have social good in mind when it is putting some meat on the bones of these proposals.</p><p>Beyond that, one point about the entire strategy has been troubling me, and I would like the minister to address it either when she concludes the debate or in writing later. At various points of the strategy, the minister has identified that one of the priorities of the &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; report was to enable participation in the arts to lead to professional careers. I whole-heartedly support that aim, but is it not true that many people get involved in the arts through college courses? Does it not strike the minister as a little odd to have that as a priority at the same time as chipping away many of the chances that individuals have to turn their love of the creative arts into a career? I would appreciate it if the minister could clarify whether she sees any contradiction there and will work with us to ensure that links from hobby to career remain through the further education sector.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; Youth Arts Strategy"}, {"date": "2014-05-13", "body": "<p>As has become increasingly clear over the weeks since stage 2, there is widespread public concern about and condemnation of zero-hours contracts when they are imposed on employees with no guarantee of a minimum number of hours of work and when the employees are restricted by their contracts from seeking other work with which to supplement their incomes.</p><p>Recently published research by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service highlights the findings that employees who are on zero-hours contracts are too afraid to search for new jobs and feel excluded from the sense of security that other full-time workers enjoy.

The new Forth bridge is an exciting development and one that is essential to the continued growth of Fife and of Scotland&#8217;s economy, and it is one for which I and other Labour party members in Fife campaigned over a long period. There has been a huge increase in west Fife&#8217;s population in recent years, and improved transport links over the Forth are needed to support the economies of Edinburgh, Fife and the central belt.</p><p>Since I became an MSP, I have become a regular user of public transport between Fife and Edinburgh and have gained an insight into the trials and tribulations of the travel choices facing commuters from west Fife. Like many other commuters, my decision to take the car, bus or train is influenced by the weather, my diary and things that I have to do later in the day, which might include work or family commitments, shopping or even socialising. Timing is critical. I have learned that the car parks at Inverkeithing, Rosyth, Dunfermline Town and Dunfermline Queen Margaret stations are usually full on week days by 8 o&#8217;clock, and it is often standing room only on the peak-time trains between Edinburgh and Fife.</p><p>If one does have to use one&#8217;s car to drive over the bridge, the traffic on the approach can often tail back well beyond the junctions off the M90, and then one has to find somewhere to park at an affordable rate when one gets to Edinburgh. Car sharing is an option, but in my experience, despite there now being three Labour MSPs travelling from west Fife to the Scottish Parliament every day, different schedules can make car sharing difficult.</p><p>Although it has been open only a matter of months, the success of the new park and ride at Halbeath in boosting bus travel is entirely understandable. That said, there is more that could be done and I am pleased that the motion recognises the opportunity to increase the potential of the scheme. We now have 1,000 spaces at Halbeath, where the choice for car drivers is limited to bus or car share, in a facility that is surrounded by new housing development&#8212;in the eastern expansion at Dunfermline, at Kelty, just off the next junction on the M90, and in the village of Crossgates, which is located right beside the park and ride and has seen several new neighbourhoods added to the village in recent years, and is still growing.</p><p>There is much that could be done to improve the value of the site in promoting modal shift away from car use, and the most obvious improvement would be the installation of a rail halt and railway station. There is a clear demand for that. As I mentioned, many of the car parks at stations in west Fife are often full to overflowing, which creates inevitable overspill into surrounding streets and inconvenience for local residents. It has even been suggested that some of the well-documented parking problems at Queen Margaret hospital are caused by overspill parking from the nearby Dunfermline Queen Margaret station.</p><p>Although I live in Dunfermline and it is only 1.6 miles from my house to the station, I tend to take the car to the station. Walking is not always convenient and for many people it is not possible, because of time constraints or mobility problems, so access to transport interchanges is a key factor in considering whether the travelling public will use them.</p><p>I would like to thank Living Streets, which has made me aware of the work that it did with residents of Halbeath and has called for improvements to the local environment for pedestrians of all ages and abilities, and for the removal of barriers and the creation of new paths in the local community, which would give local residents, as well as those arriving by car, the opportunity to use the new facility. I will be asking Fife Council to keep that on its radar.</p><p>Until just a few weeks ago, I was the Fife councillor for Crossgates, where the park and ride is sited. The community council regularly complained to me that the facility should be called Crossgates park and ride, and that it should be accessible to pedestrians and cyclists from the village. Having failed to get the name changed, I am keen to do what I can to widen access for local people. Crossgates has a proud record of environmental activism and it wants to see that extended to its travel choices.</p><p>There is a similar access issue in Cowdenbeath, which has a train station just over three miles from the new park and ride. Anyone who made the journey to Cowdenbeath for the recent by-election will know that the station is not accessible to people who have mobility problems and there is no adjacent taxi access or parking. A new rail halt, although not in the town itself, could provide additional accessible options for rail travellers in Fife while easing the pressure on stations such as Cowdenbeath.</p><p>At the heart of the park and ride, and of any public transport development, should be a commitment to the needs of those who use the services and those who could be encouraged or assisted to do so. It is equally important to improve the quality of life for people who live in communities surrounding railway stations and other transport hubs.</p><p>The Halbeath facility has the potential to deliver modal shift, support low carbon options, increase local access, and provide for increased mobility.

I have to leave at the end of my speech.</p><p>First of all, I find it unfortunate that the members&#8217; business system has been used to shoehorn in this debate. Let us be clear that this debate has been designed not to highlight local issues but to be part of the wider referendum campaign.</p><p>I also find it rich that we are talking about the 0.7 per cent contribution to the international aid budget. After all, despite having this large economy that we keep hearing about, the UK failed to achieve that target in 43 years. Indeed, it did not manage to do so even when Malcolm Chisholm was a UK Government minister.</p><p>Moreover, that discussion misses the point that the 0.7 per cent target relates to the share of a country&#8217;s budget, not its actual monetary terms. The target recognises that economies across the world vary in size, and it is all about countries putting aside a specific share of their own budgets to help the aid budget across the world. I find it unfortunate that people are suggesting that, because Scotland&#8217;s economy is not of the same magnitude as that of the wider UK, our efforts to contribute to international aid and international development would be diminished. It is a very neat encapsulation of the &#8220;too wee, too poor&#8221; argument.</p><p>We should also be clear that, in the grand scheme of international populations, we are not small; we are mid-table, and I think that we should be wary of always referring to ourselves as a small nation. Undoubtedly we are smaller than some of the world&#8217;s nations, but we are still capable of punching above our weight in a range of areas, including international development. The minister is on record as saying that, for him, 0.7 per cent is only the beginning of the aspirations that Scotland should have for its contribution to international development, and I find that goal pretty inspirational. I think that we absolutely should be aiming to achieve 1 per cent in very short order.</p><p>I am also concerned by this idea that we have to be either all in or all out&#8212;in other words, if we are not all for what the UK is doing in international development, we must be dead set against it. We on these benches are not saying that everything that the UK Government is doing or has done in international development is wrong; we are not suggesting that and are not seeking to characterise the issue in those terms. What we are saying, however, is that an independent Scotland might choose to pursue different priorities for expenditure and different priorities with regard to the way aid itself is defined.</p><p>The definition of aid is an interesting issue. A debate on the matter is currently taking place within the UK Government, with David Cameron suggesting the possibility of factoring in military expenditure to the contribution to the aid budget. I do not think that we should aspire to that sort of approach; indeed, we should be deeply troubled by and hesitant about accepting any notion that arms sales to regimes, for example, could count as aid.</p><p>On jobs, I do not have a local interest in the matter, as I do not represent East Kilbride or Central Scotland, but the idea that somehow we would not require jobs and expertise after independence is fanciful. It is not true to say that the international development budget would drop after independence because Scotland would be an independent country. Scotland would have an aid budget and an international development budget, which it would require to fund appropriately. The idea that nothing would be spent and no one would work in these areas in Scotland is fanciful, and it borders on being misleading.</p><p>We have the opportunity to put Scotland on the world stage, to advance the values that we hold and to pursue the priorities that we would have as an independent nation across the world. We could use the figure of 0.7 per cent as a starting point, and the minister has aspirations to go further, which I share.</p><p>In addition, we would be in a position to work with other countries. The one thing that really irritates me in the referendum debate is the conflation of independence with isolationism, and the idea that being independent means that Scotland would only ever do stuff by itself and would not work with others. The difference that independence would make is that we would work together and collaborate with others on our own priorities and on our terms, which does not currently happen. If, after independence, we sought to work with the rest of the UK on a particular issue, that would be fine&#8212;we could do that&#8212;but we should also be able to take our own path and lead the way in other areas.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Department for International Development"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p>I take this opportunity to welcome the investment in those facilities that the Scottish Government is making.</p><p>Can the cabinet secretary advise how much capital investment is currently being made in Aberdeen by the Scottish Government, and the background that that investment is set against?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: New Cancer Centre and Women&#8217;s Hospital (Aberdeen) (Funding)"}, {"date": "2014-08-13", "body": "<p></p><p>6.

His neighbour across the street spots him arriving home with the gun and thinks to himself, &#8220;We must live in an unsafe street. I&#8217;d better go out and buy a gun.&#8221;</p><p>So it is with the idea of nuclear deterrence: it is there to protect us from a threat that does not exist.

It is a threat that no longer exists, but there are nuclear weapons just in case somebody out there develops a nuclear capability and chooses to target it against us.</p><p>The point about renewing the Trident nuclear capability, whatever the size of that capability, and the idea that reducing the size of a nuclear deterrent is somehow an acceptable thing to do, is that one nuclear warhead is one too many, as far as I am concerned. Reducing the size of the capability does not matter. Unless it is reduced to zero, I am not interested, frankly.</p><p>The message that renewing the Trident system sends out to states that may or may not be trying to develop nuclear weapons capability is not that we are serious about nuclear disarmament; it is that we are serious about the continuation of nuclear deterrence or lack of deterrence in the current international system. We need to get beyond the idea that we are defending ourselves by having Trident on our shores. I am not suggesting that we are necessarily making ourselves a target, but there is no defence for Trident, because Trident itself is no defence.</p><p>I understand and accept that there are jobs that are linked to the presence of Trident on the Clyde, but I have a difficulty with supporting something of the ilk of nuclear weapons on the basis that jobs are attached to them, because I believe that the amount of money that is spent on Trident would be far better spent supporting far more jobs that are deployed in other ways.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>I am sorry, but I have only four minutes.

The Labour Party often tells us that its position on the referendum is not so much to vote no; it is to vote no and then, hopefully, vote for and elect Labour in 2015 and everything will be all right. That is a leap of faith and a leap of logic that it has to justify.</p><p>The leap of faith on Trident that has to be justified involves not just voting no and then voting Labour in 2015; it involves voting no, voting Labour in 2015 and hoping beyond hope that the prevailing voices in Labour are those of Malcolm Chisholm and Neil Findlay and not those of Jim Murphy and Jackie Baillie. That is the difficulty that the Labour Party has to reconcile. It cannot come to the table and say with any categorical assurance that a no vote would result in a no to Trident.</p><p>What we can say categorically is that, while the world sits around the table waiting for somebody to blink, a yes vote gives us the opportunity to be the first ones to do so and to lead the way internationally.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>Will the member give way?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p></p><p>9.

One whom she omitted is the Labour MP for Leeds East, George Mudie, who has come out and said that Scotland should be independent. How refreshing that a Labour MP who represents an English constituency can see independence as the right choice for the nation of his birth and where he grew up. How sad and depressing that the Labour politicians who are in Scotland cannot see past their antipathy towards the SNP and recognise the possibilities that independence could bring for Scotland.</p><p>Johann Lamont made the claim that we on the SNP benches did not get into politics to improve Scotland but instead to impoverish it, which I think is a rather unfortunate slight to make. She thinks that we see independence as an end and not as a means. That demonstrates a total misunderstanding, and it also overlooks the improvements in public services that have been delivered in this Parliament.</p><p>Nobody would seek to say that there have not been improvements in Scottish public life as a result of the establishment of the devolved Parliament, but the point is that devolution can take us only so far. When we have a Westminster Government that acts against the interests of Scotland, we find ourselves having to mitigate where we can and, where we are not able to do so, having to simply thole what is wrought upon Scotland by Westminster.</p><p>Independence is not a magic wand, but it is a toolkit to improve Scotland and make it a better place. In 1997, the idea was put to Scotland that decisions about Scotland were best taken in Scotland and by the people of Scotland, on a range of areas such as health, education and justice. That was true irrespective of what the party of Government was at Westminster, because it was the Labour Party in power that delivered devolution for Scotland in those areas. It recognised that Westminster did not work for Scotland in those areas and that Scotland should take those decisions.</p><p>What we on the SNP benches seek to do is simply to extend that maxim and that principle to other areas of policy, whether it is to Trident&#8212;I was interested to hear Mr Rennie talk about all the things that we can already do in Scotland; one thing that we cannot do is rid ourselves of the abomination of nuclear weapons in Scotland, but with the powers that independence would bring, we could set that right&#8212;or to issues around welfare and fairness.</p><p>The idea that we have the best of both worlds is an interesting soundbite. However, some of our most vulnerable citizens have a degree of social protection provided to them through the fact that we continue to control our health service, here in Scotland, but when those people leave their GP surgeries and enter the clutches of Westminster welfare reform, we are, to all intents and purposes, powerless to help them. We can put in place forms of mitigation, and we have done that where we can, but we cannot address all the adverse impacts of welfare reform, such as the fact that 100,000 children will be plunged into poverty as a result of it. We can do some stuff to help those children, but we cannot do all the things that we would like to do; we cannot reverse some of the decisions that are being taken.</p><p>I welcome the expert group on welfare&#8217;s approach and in particular its comments on the carers allowance. For a long time I have campaigned for carers and in particular for the carers allowance, so it is very refreshing to see that allowance&#8212;it has been one of the forgotten benefits&#8212;looked at with great seriousness.</p><p>It does not behove the Labour Party to dismiss&#8212;as its spokesperson did at the time&#8212;that very important piece of work as a bribe. I do not agree with the idea that if we offer people something that they do not have, we are offering them a bribe. We are offering a substantial piece of policy regarding a very important group in Scottish society. Rather than deriding that as a bribe, the Westminster parties could guarantee similar increases in the carers allowance in the current system. The fact that they choose not to says everything about how the Westminster system operates in relation to those who are dependent on the welfare state.</p><p>We often hear it told that Scotland would not be considered to have a credible or serious voice in foreign policy, but foreign policy is not just about a country&#8217;s size or how loud we shout.

It is good to get people on the register, but we must ensure that the names of people who are no longer resident are taken off the register, because the issue has an impact on, for example, turnout and participation.</p><p>The discussion about voting methods is important. A good example that can be used to highlight the impact that alternative voting methods can have is the citywide referendum in Aberdeen on 1 March 2012 on the proposals for regeneration of Union Terrace Gardens. I do not want to reopen the debate about the merits of that proposal, because it is in the past, but it is worth looking at how the vote was conducted. There was an all-postal ballot, which was augmented by phone and online voting. More than 86,000 votes were cast, which represents a turnout of some 52 per cent.</p><p>If we fast forward a couple of months to the local government elections, turnout was 33.7 per cent&#8212;just a short space of time later. That tells me that the provision of an all-postal ballot, augmented with phone and online voting, boosted voter turnout. I know that the referendum in March 2012 was on a single issue, but I think that there would be merit in considering whether the approach could be replicated, given the difference between turnout in the referendum and turnout in the local elections.</p><p>In a survey, the Electoral Commission found that 52 per cent of respondents who had not voted said that that was due to</p><p>&#8220;circumstances preventing them from doing so&#8221;.</p><p>In the constituency that I represent, the proportion of offshore workers is high, as I suspect that it is in the constituencies that Kevin Stewart, Tavish Scott and other members represent.

On the potential for voter fraud or multiple casting of votes, Crawford Langley identified in his report that out of 86,000 votes there were 74 cases in which a person voted both electronically and by post. A tiny minority of individuals had done that, and in many of those cases the person had written on their ballot paper that they were posting it after voting online simply because they wanted to be sure that their vote would be counted.</p><p>Let us not forget that in the current system anyone can walk into a polling station, claim to be Betty Smith from number 5 and cast a vote, without having to produce identification. There is already the opportunity for voter fraud.</p><p>I agree entirely with what Tavish Scott said about encouraging more young people to stand for election. I was elected to Aberdeen City Council at the tender age of 26. I was by no means the youngest councillor at the time; we had a councillor who was elected at the age of 18 and who became the depute provost of the city. The reaction to those elections caused me great concern that young people might be put off politics. We were castigated as kids who were not mature enough to make decisions on behalf of the people. If we want young people to get involved in politics and stand for election, we must make them feel that they will be valued when they participate.

He said that a yes vote in September would lead to the removal of the immoral and illegal Trident system from Faslane and Scotland.</p><p>Despite the fact that I have said in many public meetings that I and many other members, although perhaps not Mr Findlay, have attended over the past few months that a yes vote will not change a thing and that it is what we do afterwards that matters&#8212;</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, {"date": "2014-08-06", "body": "<p>Let me assure the chamber that one thing will change: Trident is for the dustbin and will not be renewed.</p><p>Today we commemorate what happened in Japan 69 years ago.

The Scottish Government&#8217;s motion talks about improving entrepreneurship among women and young people in Scotland and, like the Liberal Democrat, Willie Rennie, I am not young or a woman. However, it was a Liberal Democrat woman&#8212;Shirley Williams, or Baroness Williams of Crosby&#8212;who claimed that George W Bush said to a UK Prime Minister that the problem with the French is that they do not have a word for entrepreneur. I would say that the problem with the word &#8220;entrepreneur&#8221;&#8212;a French word&#8212;is that it is too often associated with men, and not always with men who are that young.</p><p>In the north-east, we know what an entrepreneur looks like. After all, Aberdeen is a powerhouse of the UK, as the present UK Prime Minister said. However, that culture of entrepreneurship was not born with the discovery of oil and gas in the North Sea. With the whisky industry, farming and fishing, generations of north-east entrepreneurs have contributed to the wealth of this nation through the creation of new and innovative businesses operating at home and abroad. Working in the fishing industry for more than 30 years, I met many of those entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, I would need only a few fingers of one hand to count the number of women heading seafood businesses whom I met across Scotland during all those years.</p><p>This afternoon, we have heard from a lot of members. Christina McKelvie gave a good example of entrepreneurship relating to crutches and, as I need some help in that regard, I might ask her to give me the details of that particular entrepreneur. However, as much as I would like to congratulate those who have celebrated women entrepreneurs, there is a real issue that we must tackle, and it is occupational segregation.</p><p>One of the most respected entrepreneurs in the north-east is Sir Ian Wood, a man who came from the fishing industry to successfully create one of the largest enterprises servicing the oil and gas sector in Scotland and around the world. He has the can-do attitude that the Scottish Government is promoting and, like the cabinet secretary, he wants underrepresented groups to be able to realise their potential as entrepreneurs. How wonderful it is that Sir Ian Wood published his commission&#8217;s report on Tuesday. The final report of the commission focuses on business and industry working with schools and colleges as a key factor in ensuring that young people are more prepared for work and better informed about career choices. That is extremely important for young girls and young boys. Like my colleague Dennis Robertson, I think that tackling occupational segregation as early as possible is the key to success.</p><p>The commission&#8217;s report also contains recommendations on encouraging and supporting more employers to recruit more young people, as well as a number of recommendations on advancing equalities in education and youth employment. Once again, the Scottish Government is working in partnership with the people who know best how to develop the potential that we have here in Scotland. We need the collective team Scotland approach that we have heard about this afternoon to bring companies, universities, public agencies and customers together to exploit more opportunities to drive growth and increase exports.</p><p>Let me illustrate where we are at here in Scotland and how that collaborative approach is working well. Last month, I had the pleasure of attending a skills summit in Aberdeen that was delivered by the Scottish Council for Development and Industry and Skills Development Scotland in partnership with OPITO, which, as we have heard, is the oil and gas industry&#8217;s focal point for skills, learning and workforce development. Many issues were considered at the event, which launched Scottish apprenticeship week 2014, including employer engagement with schools. Apprenticeship is extremely important. In the north-east, we know that many young entrepreneurs started as apprentices at a young age.</p><p>I was very impressed by the speakers that the organisers had lined up and by the number of organisations that attended and participated in the discussions. I was particularly impressed by the first speaker, the Scottish Government&#8217;s Cabinet Secretary for Training, Youth and Women&#8217;s Employment, Angela Constance. I was not the only one to be impressed.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s newest cabinet secretary had to leave Aberdeen shortly after her speech, but I will illustrate how it was received. The chair of the Aston University Engineering Academy, Professor Alison Halstead, told the Scottish audience how impressed she was by the fact that a Government cabinet secretary was working in partnership with others to help young people and women to have their economic potential unleashed. Professor Halstead told us how different the way in which the UK Government works down south is. I am afraid that she blamed most of that on someone who came from Aberdeen, who is not an entrepreneur, but a politician&#8212;the UK Secretary of State for Education and the Member of Parliament for Surrey Heath, Michael Gove MP. We were warned by Professor Halstead that the Westminster Government has a real lack of understanding when it comes to educating young people to be ready for work in the 21st century. She told us that we were on the right path here in Scotland.</p><p>As several members have said and as Sir Ian Wood&#8217;s commission&#8217;s report concluded, we must understand that in many areas, such as advancing equalities in Scottish education and youth employment, there are no quick fixes. When it comes to occupational segregation, schools clearly have an influence at a crucial stage. Although the problem could never be resolved in its entirety solely by schools, as Dennis Robertson said, in its report on women and work, the Equal Opportunities Committee noted that it was industry&#8217;s view that sector representatives should be brought into schools to enhance careers advice by countering gender stereotypes. Subject choice at school is absolutely key to addressing gender segregation in the workplace.</p><p>That is why I would like the Government to go further than the recommendations of Sir Ian Wood&#8217;s commission and to open primary schools as well as secondary schools to business and industry representatives. In my view, it must be representatives who carry out that role, rather than individual businesses. As much as headteachers have opened the doors of their schools since the implementation of curriculum for excellence, teachers do not have the time to consider multiple requests every year. The collaborative approach must be co-ordinated.</p><p>I am sorry to say that Jenny Marra does not have a leg to stand on in what she has said and what her amendment says about college places.</p><p>Nothing should stand in the way of both genders taking equal advantage of opportunities that are available in modern Scotland. I trust the Government to deliver the shared vision for women and young people across Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Improving Entrepreneurship among Women and Young People"}, {"date": "2014-06-03", "body": "<p>Like the members before me, I congratulate Christina McKelvie on securing this debate on an important motion that recognises the work that One Parent Families Scotland has done in Scotland for the past 65 years with regard to advocacy and service delivery expertise. It has more than 200 staff and a turnover of more than &#163;2 million.</p><p>I particularly enjoyed Christina McKelvie&#8217;s opening speech, which made a good point about mothers and fathers. Malcolm Chisholm talked about the great services for fathers that we now have in Edinburgh. He also talked about opportunities for single parents, which is something that I recognise very much. I know that JK Rowling is a great example for single mothers, but we need to have that kind of example for single fathers as well. It is important to have such a role model that can enable people to understand what opportunities there are for single parents both during the time when they are raising their children and after their children have grown up.</p><p>As Clare Adamson pointed out, for more than 10 years I was a single father. That is part of myself and is one of the reasons why I am in Parliament today. The struggle of being a single parent can make people realise the challenges that are involved for single mothers and single fathers, and for the children.</p><p>I recognise the fantastic work that One Parent Families Scotland does. I know how much it encourages lone parents in the north-east of Scotland to believe in themselves, discover new talents, take up new interests and enter education, training or work. In Dundee, it runs a community family support project. It also runs a group called us together&#8212;supporting Scotland&#8217;s children and their fathers. I note in OPFS&#8217;s annual report that contributors such as Scottish Television have made great contributions to enable the organisation to develop innovative services such as those at the new Families House in Dundee, which I would love to go and visit.</p><p>Dundee also has flexible childcare facilities. Those same services are replicated in rural Scotland. Sometimes, we forget about rural Scotland. We need to consider more than just the services that are deployed in towns and in the central belt, but the services that are deployed in the north, the north-east and other parts of rural Scotland where single parents may face more challenges.</p><p>We have flexible childcare services in Aberdeenshire and Angus. High-quality registered childminders are offered in a person&#8217;s home. That home-based childcare is very important. When I was a single parent, I started work very early in the morning, and I needed that childcare to allow me to keep working. It is not easy to find that support in rural Scotland or even across Scotland.</p><p>Cr&#232;ches are now provided all across Aberdeenshire. It is a fantastic time to be a single parent because, at last, it is recognised not only in Parliament but out in the world how valuable our single parent families are.</p><p>I will talk briefly about our work in the Equal Opportunities Committee. We began our inquiry on fathers and parenting because 8 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s 165,000 single parents are fathers. That means that around 13,000 families are headed by a single dad. The Equal Opportunities Committee took evidence on fathers and parenting, and One Parent Families Scotland brought to us fantastic evidence to help us in our work.</p><p>Some of the recommendations were about nursery staff, health visitors and how it feels to be excluded. That exclusion is particularly acute for single fathers, although it applies to single mothers, too. A single father said in a survey that society puts too many unnecessary barriers in our way. Lone parents and their children deserve better; becoming a lone father to a family is difficult enough.</p><p>One Parent Families Scotland said that the fathers it spoke to wanted to be treated as parents who have the same skills and face the same challenges as mothers. In 21st century Scotland, single parents must be treated equally to couples whatever their skills and whatever challenges they face. Families are not just about the numbers&#8212;the number of parents or children in a family should not matter.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: One Parent Families Scotland"}, {"date": "2014-05-21", "body": "<p>This is an important debate and I wish that we had more time for it.</p><p>Yesterday, as the convener said, the committee went up town for a breath of fresh air. Our visit to the Court of Session was a breath of fresh air and I was very impressed. I take the opportunity to thank the Lord President, Lord Gill; the chairman of the Judicial Institute for Scotland, Lord Malcolm; Sheriff Welsh and Sheriff Duff for their welcome. It was a privilege to see the high-quality training environment that now exists for our judges. The Judicial Institute is fit for the 21st century, with training that uses new technologies and facilitates collaborative learning. I was really impressed to hear and see the judicial system reforming itself and reflecting the aspirations of the Scottish people in a modern Scotland.</p><p>The Courts Reform (Scotland) Bill was introduced to respond to the same aspirations. The bill seeks to implement the recommendations of the review led by Lord Gill. The tone of the review&#8217;s conclusions was strong:</p><p>&#8220;Scottish civil courts provide a service to the public that is slow, inefficient and expensive.&#8221;</p><p>It also said:</p><p>&#8220;The court system has to be reformed both structurally and functionally.&#8221;</p><p>Committee members agreed with most of the bill and supported its general principles. On page 30 of our report, we stated:</p><p>&#8220;On balance, we consider that the proposed increase in the privative jurisdiction of the sheriff court from &#163;5,000 to &#163;150,000 may be too great a leap.&#8221;</p><p>Let me repeat that statement: &#163;150,000 may be too great a leap. I was the one in the committee who was not convinced that &#163;150,000 was too great a leap. That is why paragraph 144 starts with the words &#8220;On balance&#8221; and why we thought of qualifying the first sentence with the words &#8220;may be&#8221;.</p><p>On 22 April, Sheriff Principal Taylor came to the committee and made his point very clear. He said that those who have an axe to grind would have us depart from the bill in a number of areas. One such area is that of the sheriff court having a privative jurisdiction of &#163;150,000.</p><p>Sheriff Principal Taylor, the Lord President, Citizens Advice Scotland and the consumer champion Which? all said that &#163;150,000 is appropriate, and I seek an assurance from the Scottish Government that all views will be considered.</p><p>Let me be clear: we heard a lot of talk of data and percentages to justify reducing the proposed threshold when we took evidence, but Sheriff Principal Taylor answered the concerns from the outset. He told the committee:</p><p>&#8220;When we selected that figure, my approach was not to consider what percentage of cases should be moved from the Court of Session to the sheriff court; my starting point was to settle on a figure for cases that I consider to be appropriate for determination by a sheriff.&#8221;</p><p>More important, the sheriff principal concluded with the following statement:</p><p>&#8220;It is a judgment call.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 22 April 2014; c 4516.]</p><p>A judgment call&#8212;one that I can understand. Members might recall how I spoke in another debate about the Scottish legal system&#8217;s difficulty in accepting far-reaching reforms.</p><p>I agreed with Lord Gill when he said that the present limit is utterly ridiculous, and I might add that it should have been increased a long time ago. Citizen Advice Scotland&#8217;s briefing could not be clearer when it states:</p><p>&#8220;Reducing the limit from the &#163;150,000 limit proposed could, in practice, undermine many of the proposed reforms to court structure and specialisation.&#8221;</p><p>Here we are. The question remains: is &#163;150,000 too great a leap? I do not think so, which is why I ask the Scottish Government and the minister to consider all views on the matter. Scotland&#8217;s civil courts system must be replaced with one that is more effective and efficient, and I am delighted that all members of the Justice Committee support the general principles of the bill.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Courts Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, {"date": "2014-05-14", "body": "<p>Last week, we celebrated the value of our fantastic youth workers in improving young people&#8217;s life chances across Scotland. Today, I am delighted to speak on the arts strategy to support Scotland&#8217;s children and young people to flourish through culture and creativity.</p><p>In recognising the positive impact that the arts and creativity can have, the Government is working in collaboration with many others to achieve the aims of the youth arts strategy. The cabinet secretary spoke about the network of regional youth arts hubs across the country. That collaborative approach works through partnerships between local and national arts and youth services providers. Access to youth arts for all across the many communities of Scotland&#8212;remote, rural and urban communities&#8212;is vital for our young people.</p><p>A lot is happening at national level, and we punch well above our weight in the arts, culture and creativity. The decision of the National Theatre of Scotland to have no stage of its own has created a spirit of freedom of space that redefines what national theatre can be about. Scotland is the stage for the national theatre, and that has pulled down barriers and allowed more creative thinking about how we can develop the arts in Scotland.</p><p>Like many in the chamber, I dragged my children to see a play that has been seen by tens of thousands of people across three continents and which has won 22 awards, including four Laurence Olivier awards&#8212;for best director, best theatre choreography, best play and best sound design. In fact, the National Theatre of Scotland won its first US award when the New York Drama Critics&#8217; Circle named that play&#8212;&#8220;Black Watch&#8221;&#8212;best foreign play.</p><p>At last year&#8217;s festival of politics here in the Parliament, I saw the Scottish Youth Theatre perform &#8220;Now&#8217;s The Hour&#8221;. I know that other members present in the chamber went to that performance. We were very touched by it and surprised by its quality, the quality of delivery and the creativity and imagination of the young people involved. In the past few years, I have participated in many debates to inform the people of Scotland about the decision that they will make on 18 September this year, but none of those debates were as inspirational or informative as the play &#8220;Now&#8217;s The Hour&#8221;, which was created by our young people.</p><p>The &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; youth arts strategy recognises the fantastic input of our young people and builds on it. Like the National Theatre of Scotland, the Scottish Youth Theatre is working with local government and other parties to ensure that participation, creativity, talent development and cultural expression are developed now and in the future across Scotland. The Scottish Youth Theatre is particularly best placed to work on curriculum for excellence as the company&#8217;s ethos is focused on creating confident individuals, successful learners, effective contributors and responsible citizens. Of course, many of our young people, some of whom are here today, will have the right to contribute as responsible citizens when voting in September.</p><p>For people in the north-east, which is the region that I represent, the Scottish Youth Theatre is holding weekly classes at His Majesty&#8217;s Theatre in Aberdeen. The sessions are open to anyone regardless of previous experience, and they are a fantastic way to build self-confidence, which like creativity and partnership is a quality that our young people need whether or not they will be involved in the arts in their working lives thereafter.</p><p>In particular, marginalised young people and children from diverse cultural backgrounds&#8212;like me and my children&#8212;will use the new youth arts hubs for Aberdeen and the north-east. I agreed with Ben Torrie, director of programming and creative projects for Aberdeen Performing Arts, when he said that the new hub will harness the energy and creative potential of young people in the region through an inclusive, innovative and engaging programme of youth arts activity that is shaped and driven by the participants. It is very important that it is shaped and driven by the young people.</p><p>Another local partner in the north-east hub is the Station House Media Unit, which is called SHMU in the north-east. This charity, established in 2003, is one of the core cultural organisations in Aberdeen and is at the forefront of community media development in Scotland, supporting residents in the seven regeneration areas of the city in radio and video production, traditional and online publications, music production and digital inclusion.</p><p>The organisation supports marginalised young people through its employability and training arm. It runs positive transitions, an employability course open to 16 to 19-year-olds from Aberdeen city who are not in education, employment or training. The course runs for 12 weeks. I have been twice to listen to young people who went through the course, and they made their families very proud and proved that arts, culture and creativity can change our young people&#8217;s lives for the better.</p><p>There is a lot of good work to build on, and efforts are being made to recognise the importance of collaboration&#8212;working with local government and the third sector to ensure that participation, creativity, talent development and cultural expression are developed now and in the future.</p><p>The Government is putting the young people of Scotland at the heart of Scotland&#8217;s creative future. I could give many examples, but I do not have time to do so. I will, however, speak about Woodend Barn in Banchory, whose creative learning programme provides opportunities for development across a broad range of social groups, with events ranging from film-making workshops for young people to arts-and-crafts workshops. Such initiatives are very important. They are community based, and they respond very well to the needs of young people in rural areas. I am pleased to use them often&#8212;not to participate, unfortunately, but to see what young people are providing in our rural areas.</p><p>Scotland also has a global reach, and we want our young people to learn from other cultures and to perform across the world. At Aberdeen&#8217;s Beach ballroom in March this year, I was invited by Aberdeen councillor Jim Kiddie to the fundraising dinner held by Friends of Aberdeen International Youth Festival, which has been running for more than 40 years and which is another partner of the new youth arts hub. The money that was raised went to support not only young artists from across the north-east of Scotland but also those from developing regions in Africa, Asia and South America.</p><p>&#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; is Scotland&#8217;s first-ever youth arts strategy. It is further proof that the Scottish Government believes that public funding of the arts is fundamentally good.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Time to Shine&#8221; Youth Arts Strategy"}, {"date": "2014-05-07", "body": "<p></p><p>8.

I want Scotland to be the best place in the world for my children, my grandchildren and all young people to grow up&#8212;just like the minister said earlier.</p><p>The role of public and voluntary services is pivotal in achieving that and we must ensure that our services for young people are fit for 21st-century Scotland. The youth work strategy is the best way to build a fairer society. We already have a strong youth work sector, which empowers young people to improve their own wellbeing and life chances, although that needs funding, of course&#8212;as some members have alluded to.</p><p>I welcome the announcement today of the &#163;2.1 million cashback funding for Scotland&#8217;s youth projects. YouthLink Scotland administers that fund to build the capacity of young people and the youth work organisations who work to support them.</p><p>In North East Scotland, the region that I represent, cashback for communities&#8217; youth work awards made a real difference last year. Aberdeenshire received a total of &#163;30,530, of which Aberdeenshire Youth Council received &#163;2,580. Although the work of Aberdeenshire Youth Council is different from what we are talking about today, a lot of people who joined the youth council started in youth work, in voluntary organisations where they were given great help from youth workers.</p><p>In Inverurie on 14 September 2013, a lot of organisations came together to support Aberdeenshire Youth Council&#8217;s anti-bullying awareness parade. The parade was very important as it gave the community in Inverurie the opportunity to stand up to bullying and provided an occasion to showcase services that are available to young people for support and advice.</p><p>We should always remember that youth work is about empowering young people and making them the focus of what can be done, how it can be done and how it can be delivered.</p><p>Cashback for communities&#8217; youth work awards were very important for Aberdeen as well, which won &#163;21,000. Of that money, a sum just short of &#163;3,000 went to the Youth Outreach Bus Trust, which we have talked about. Buses are important and can help youth workers to reach young people. Such trusts are great places for youth workers to work in. I visited one in Aberdeen, which was quite fantastic. I really enjoyed using some of the devices that it had.</p><p>Angus received a total of &#163;9,000 last year and Dundee received &#163;13,000.</p><p>As a past member of the Westhill community development group, in my community in Aberdeenshire, I witnessed at first hand the invaluable contribution of our youth workers, past and present. I recall how pivotal they were in involving our young people in the making it real planning exercise, which was a community effort to plan for the future of our community. It is important to have young people very much involved in our future, contributing to how we should build up our communities. That effort saw generations working together for the benefit of all.</p><p>I welcome the fact that Westhill volunteers, youth workers and young people visited other communities across Aberdeenshire, including in Peterhead, where we visited the Hot Spot, which is a community hub for all. I have just noticed that young people from primary 7 at Peterhead central school have joined us today. I am sure that they know the Hot Spot very well.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s vision is clear: early intervention and preventative spending deliver better outcomes for our young people, and we want all young people to have the skills for lifelong learning and work.</p><p>There is another aspect to the vision: greater integration and partnership at a local level are bringing our communities together. There are many examples of community groups opening up to our young people and helping generations to work together for the common good and the development of individuals, like those that Liam McArthur talked about.</p><p>Every day, an army of youth workers and dedicated volunteers throughout Scotland helps our young people to be the successful, confident, effective and responsible individuals that Scotland needs to flourish.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: National Youth Work Strategy"}, {"date": "2014-04-29", "body": "<p>Jamie McGrigor started well, although unfortunately his ending was not so much to my liking.

Her amendment talks about recognising</p><p>&#8220;the role played by the industry in promoting seafood supply chains locally and the importance of raising public awareness of the benefits of domestic consumption&#8221;.</p><p>I very much agree with that but, unfortunately, she used 11 minutes to talk about conservation and only 30 seconds to talk about the industry. I would like to talk a lot more about the industry.</p><p>I am delighted to speak on the Scottish fishing industry, which has a great tradition and is now looking forward to a bright future. That was not always the case; Scottish fishing is a tradition that was born of necessity. A few centuries ago, people who were living off the land had to move to the coast and were forced to adjust to a new lifestyle and to try to earn a living from fishing, which most of them had no experience of. That is why I believe that management of our inshore fisheries sector is as much about our traditional fishing rights as it is about securing a bright and vibrant industry for generations to come.</p><p>Every year, &#163;90&#160;million-worth of seafood is landed by 1,500 inshore fishing vessels, which shows us the importance of inshore fisheries to the Scottish fishing industry as a whole. As the cabinet secretary said, the three main components of the Scottish Government&#8217;s inshore fisheries strategy are management of inshore fisheries, engagement with inshore fishermen and the strengthening of management through the network of inshore fisheries groups. Those components are recognised by the whole industry as being great achievements on which to build.</p><p>As the Scottish Government motion suggests, the issue is about not only the great economic success of the industry but the cultural contribution of our fishermen and fishing communities to our past and Scotland&#8217;s future. I spent the past 30 years exporting the sort of top quality high-value seafood products that Jamie McGrigor talked about, and I have never stopped promoting Scotland since I came to this country. Some of the best seafood that Scotland has to offer is in our restaurants and on the fish counters of our fishmongers and retailers.</p><p>As the Labour amendment suggests, we all have a responsibility to raise public awareness of the benefits of domestic consumption. I welcome Labour&#8217;s contribution to the debate and I urge Claudia Beamish and other members to support industry calls for consumers to buy local and eat Scottish.

In total, 18 quayside conversations were held. We talked about quota ownership, leasing costs, the lack of flexibility in the cod recovery plan, the conflict that the cabinet secretary talked about, diversification, flexibility, new entrants, marine protection areas and creel management.</p><p>We also talked about another important part of the sector: the processing sector. A need for greater support for the onshore sector was highlighted, as were the need to promote new markets and to provide continuity of supply, which is important. We can find that continuity of supply through the inshore fisheries.</p><p>We need a local approach to fisheries management&#8212;a uniform approach does not work and the local situation clearly needs to be taken into account. It is important for the local fleet to protect local fishermen who operate smaller boats, in order to secure fishing opportunities.</p><p>One of the many responses to the quayside conversations from the Scottish Government has already created many opportunities for the offshore and onshore sectors. In particular, it increased the opportunities for inshore hand-line mackerel fishing, as Jamie McGrigor pointed out. The industry asked for more fishing opportunities to be distributed to hand-line mackerel fishers in order to meet growing demand and to provide for a high-value sector that can bring considerable economic benefits to communities. At the time, after Seafish produced adverts encouraging people to eat more mackerel, fish processors considered it a priority to increase opportunities for inshore hand-line mackerel fishing, and it is still a priority. We all welcome the 1,000 extra tonnes of Scotland&#8217;s mackerel allocation that were allocated to the inshore fishery. Local approaches to fisheries management work.</p><p>Another of the quayside discussions highlighted the need for better industry representation and engagement. I recall that, in those conversations on the quayside, many people branded organisations such as the SFF and Seafish &#8220;out of touch&#8221; and said that they did not listen to, or reflect, the needs of everyone who contributes to the industry.</p><p>Following the successful quayside conversations events, Marine Scotland is this year holding a series of regional fishing industry assemblies. I welcome that, because it is important that the Scottish Government and Marine Scotland listen to every member of the industry&#8212;not only the representatives, but all fishermen and people who work onshore. I thank the Scottish Government for keeping the dialogue going with the industry, but I would really like the fishing organisations that operate in Scotland to consider how better they could interact with the people whom they represent.</p><p>I did not receive a briefing from Seafish or the Scottish Fishermen&#8217;s Federation prior to the debate&#8212;I do not know whether any of the other members did. I will contact both organisations and ask them why.</p><p>The SFF has been busy talking about the future of the industry, but only the future after a yes vote in September this year. As much as I like Bertie Armstrong&#8217;s optimism, I urge him to consider the two futures under the options of a yes vote and a no vote. I welcome his statement of 1 April this year that</p><p>&#8220;the SFF will be asking both sides of the independence debate over the coming weeks.&#8221;</p><p>Let us hope that April was the month for hard questions to the yes campaign and next month will be the turn of the no campaign.</p><p>I thank the Scottish Government for its actions, and I thank Scotland&#8217;s cabinet secretary, Richard Lochhead, for his hard work in focusing on delivering progress through the Government&#8217;s inshore fisheries strategy.</p><p>I want a profitable and vibrant Scottish fishing sector for generations to come.

As a blue badge holder and a fellow MSP, I reiterate my congratulations to Dennis Robertson on bringing forward the bill and I express my whole-hearted support for it.</p><p>To respond to Christine Grahame&#8217;s question about supermarkets, there cannot be parking enforcement there because the ground is private, but it is hoped that the word &#8220;shame&#8221; will come into things and that the public will eventually realise that what happens is simply not acceptable. However, I am afraid that there is nothing that we can currently do about private parking spaces.</p><p>In the earlier stages, I outlined why I supported the bill. It brings a much-needed improvement in the administration and enforcement of the blue badge scheme as well as wider recognition of its importance. It is crucial that any update to the scheme brings tangible benefits to blue badge holders without placing undue burdens or legal concerns on them. The bill strikes that balance.</p><p>I strongly support highlighting the reliance of blue badge users on the scheme to freely carry out everyday tasks, as well as the need to close the gap in perception between those who believe that occasional misuse is acceptable and legitimate users who greatly depend on its benefits being available.</p><p>I highlighted previously a number of finer points that had yet to be discussed adequately in the bill&#8217;s early stages, including the issues of non-uniformed enforcement officers, penalties and the powers of confiscation. Amendments covering those issues were lodged and, although later withdrawn, led to constructive discussion, and I am pleased to say that I continue to support the bill in its entirety.</p><p>A range of views were expressed on the role of non-uniformed enforcement officers. Along with others, I was lobbied by Inclusion Scotland. It expressed the view that enforcement officers should be uniformed. However, we reached agreement in the Local Government and Regeneration Committee that the bill&#8217;s provision for non-uniformed enforcement officers would benefit the scheme and could be implemented smoothly.</p><p>The main issue is to pass a bill that strikes the balance between the most effective way of enforcing the legislation and showing&#8212;this is very important&#8212;an appropriate level of sensitivity to blue badge users and their personal circumstances. We rightly focused on how officers would be identified to users and how assurances could be given to organisations such as Inclusion Scotland. The committee was reassured that all officers would carry identification cards. The bill therefore strikes that balance.</p><p>That leads me on to a similar point with regard to penalties. The Law Society of Scotland highlighted concerns over the inclusion of a criminal strict liability offence for using a badge once cancelled and, in doing so, it used the sledgehammer-to-crack-a-nut analogy. However, the committee also considered Police Scotland&#8217;s views. It raised strong points in favour of the bill&#8217;s existing penalty provisions. Our task was to ensure that the bill struck an ideal balance between delivering improvements to the scheme and protecting its users. Fortunately, the views of Police Scotland prevailed.</p><p>On that point, it was mentioned that penalties imposed after unintentional misuse could hurt vulnerable users. Although an amendment motivated by such concerns was lodged, we were reassured that a person could be found guilty of an offence only if a level of knowledge or intent could be proven. Despite that, it is apparent that the enforcement of the legislation will require local authority officers and the police, where appropriate, to exercise their duties with a good deal of care and sensitivity.</p><p>Although we were agreed that in clear-cut cases of fraud we expect the perpetrator to be prosecuted, we would all expect discretion to be shown in the more complex cases that will undoubtedly arise. The bill allows for such flexibility and will minimise incidents of innocent misuse through clearer communication to blue badge holders. The proposed 10-point card will answer any questions in that regard. For example, the current instructions are too complicated and everyone who receives them&#8212;me included&#8212;simply flings them in the drawer.</p><p>For similar reasons, it is important that we consider carefully the implications of any new powers granted to the enforcement officers. With that in mind, we had a necessary discussion on the extension of powers to confiscate badges. Although a fellow committee member lodged an amendment to limit the proposed powers to non-valid badges only and not third-party use, it was agreed that the existing powers would substantially benefit genuine users, because abuse would be discouraged and parking spaces would therefore be freed up. Furthermore, reassurances were given that badges would be confiscated only for justifiable reasons and that valid badges would be returned within a maximum of 14 days, which is also important.</p><p>In previous debates, I touched on funding, which is an issue that is necessary to consider. However, the bill is proportionate in its resource requirements, and it will be manageable to enforce. The sensible decision against establishing an external review process is an example of that.</p><p>I am pleased to note that the bill&#8217;s implications have been discussed extensively and properly considered. As I have highlighted, the main consideration throughout has been to ensure that the ideal balance is struck between delivering scheme improvements and protecting its users. The bill achieves that balance, and it will bring benefits to the genuine blue badge scheme users, including myself. As a result, I am delighted to support the bill.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons&#8217; Parking Badges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-08-19", "body": "<p>There are still many anomalies with blue badge parking that we need to consider.

However, that was not clearly indicated, so I actually got a parking fine.</p><p>Surprisingly, one of the countries on the continent with the harshest penalties is Italy.

We have had an informative discussion today and heard a great deal of praise for all Scotland&#8217;s festivals, including festival 2014 and culture 2014. We are all agreed on the success of this year&#8217;s festivals thus far, and it is fantastic to hear such unanimous praise for the deserving performers, organisers, back-up teams and volunteers.</p><p>I add my voice to the chorus of praise from members of all parties for the plethora of festivals that are being held, including the 20th Commonwealth games, festival 2014 and culture 2014, and many others. With more than 1,000 performers across 100 venues in Glasgow, including so many activities that were free of charge, festival 2014 delivered for Scotland and displayed our prowess to the world. Furthermore, more than 1,000 events over the course of culture 2014 spanned words, movement, song, dance, music, theatre, designs, films, ideas and art. Every cultural craving was catered for.</p><p>We must of course pay tribute to the people and organisations whose commitment has enabled such a spectacular show to be put on. I echo the sentiments of fellow members in that regard. The tributes paid by my fellow members have rightly highlighted the fantastic impact of those additions to our country&#8217;s cultural prestige.</p><p>It is thanks to the people of the Glasgow 2014 organising committee, Glasgow Life, Creative Scotland and many community and cultural organisations that Scotland&#8217;s international reputation for cultural prestige has been so entertainingly demonstrated. As my learned friend said, there have been 3,000 festivals, which have highlighted the wealth of cultural talent in Scotland and our ability to put on cultural celebrations that people around the world will remember.</p><p>I take this opportunity to draw members&#8217; attention once more to the biggest and most repeated demonstration of Scotland&#8217;s creative talent and our rich cultural heritage: the Edinburgh international festival and festival fringe&#8212;the largest arts festival in the world. As an Edinburgh local and an MSP for Lothian, I take pride in all aspects of the Edinburgh festival. I pay tribute to its organisers and its performers, and to its lasting impact on the city.</p><p>The success of the festival is not attributed to a particular team of organisers or to a particular selection of performances. Rather, its success and worldwide fame is due to the ability of Scotland&#8217;s people repeatedly to put on a show that allows our best talent to flourish as well as attracting the world&#8217;s best performers to our nation&#8217;s capital. The list of people who have come to the festival and the fringe who were not famous at the time but have now become worldwide names is too long to mention.</p><p>As we heard from Sarah Boyack, the Edinburgh festival was founded in 1947 in a post-war effort to encourage participation in the arts, and it has been attracting performers and audiences from around the world in ever greater numbers ever since. It brings up a lot of impresarios and other people who want to see who the coming attractions are and what is happening.</p><p>The same can be said of the Edinburgh festival fringe, which has grown from a gatecrash by eight theatre companies. Two of those companies have an unbroken record of attendance, and I challenge my learned friend to tell me which ones they are.</p><p>Indeed, the 2013 festival saw 45,464 performances of 2,871 shows, and I am pleased to see that this year is also a sell-out. That spectacular growth and repeated success demonstrates the innate cultural progress of the people of Scotland, which I am sure we are all proud of and wish to celebrate whole-heartedly today.</p><p>The fact that such festivals go on all over Scotland indicates the strength of our arts, performance and music. It is important that we acknowledge the breadth and spectacular variety of the performances on offer every August. From drama, musicals and opera to dance, comedy and a cappella singing, the international festival and fringe truly offer something for everyone, even if the comedy does not always succeed.</p><p>When one considers that there are now&#8212;as we have heard&#8212;10 other major festivals in the annual festivities, including the Edinburgh international book festival, the science festival, the jazz and blues festival and the international military tattoo, one sees that the scale of Edinburgh&#8217;s achievement is truly amazing and deserves the greatest admiration. It is only in Edinburgh, in August, that I can attend a book talk in the morning, enjoy whichever style of comedy suits my taste in the afternoon, watch the military tattoo at night and hear the taxi drivers groaning about the crowds as I come home.</p><p>The tattoo has grown since 1949 to attract 220,000 visitors each year and an annual television audience of more than 100 million. It is further testament to Scotland&#8217;s ability to put on a world-beating international show.</p><p>We have celebrated Scotland&#8217;s recent cultural festivities and festival 2014 and culture 2014, as well as touching on our country&#8217;s spectacular heritage as demonstrated by the Edinburgh festival. However, I redraw members&#8217; attention to the number of festivals that highlight not only the strength but the breadth of Scotland&#8217;s cultural tradition: T in the Park, fringe by the sea, Lennoxlove book festival, Wigtown book festival, Dundee women&#8217;s festival, Aberdeen jazz festival, Fife comedy festival, tradfest, Penfest and Coloursfest&#8212;any fest you like. We all know the origin of the word fest, or festival, so I will not go into that.</p><p>The Commonwealth games, festival 2014 and culture 2014 delivered on the world stage. Our fine festival heritage makes it clear that we can do that again and again. As well as applauding the fantastic work of the Glasgow 2014 organising committee, Glasgow Life, Creative Scotland and the many community and cultural organisations that continue to enrich our culture, I highlight one of the key aspects of the festivals that we celebrate today: they are truly international. International participation among performers and audiences has risen higher and higher in our festivals to foster international understanding and strengthen our well-earned reputation as one of the best countries in the world for all the arts&#8212;visual and musical&#8212;to flourish in.</p><p>I hope that Scotland continues to add to its fantastic repertoire of festivals, shows and every sort of cultural event imaginable, because we have shown that we can deliver and the world is impressed. Furthermore, I hope that the debate and the attention that the festival celebrations will bring deliver some of the recognition that Scotland&#8217;s festival organisers and performers deserve for their invaluable contribution to Scotland, the arts and international collaboration.</p><p>I have no hesitation in supporting the motion and the amendment.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Festivals"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>I offer my congratulations to Bob Doris on bringing the debate to the Scottish Parliament. Regeneration is a hot topic at present, and the Local Government and Regeneration Committee has heard a great deal of evidence on where regeneration has not had the desired effect. However, as I said in a recent committee debate on the subject, there are places, such as Royston, where regeneration has had a lasting effect. It is right that we draw attention to those successes, celebrate them and, when necessary, share the valuable lessons that have been learned.</p><p>I was particularly pleased to see the emphasis in Bob Doris&#8217;s motion on the importance of local businesses, whose exclusion has been a recurring theme in some areas. It is sad that, so often, regeneration projects have failed because they have focused on attracting new businesses without having proper regard to and consideration for the local businesses that already operate in the area and without offering them the support or facilities required to help them grow. I understand that the loss of local businesses from the Royston area was one of the issues that motivated Royston&#8217;s residents to take the lead and work with local groups to reverse that trend.</p><p>The other important element to Royston&#8217;s strategy is that it is very much being led by local groups and the community. The importance of community engagement has cropped up again and again, so it is encouraging that the Royston community is at the centre of the regeneration strategy. That is also why the inspireROYSTON initiative and the community festivals are such positive developments. We could all learn from that approach.</p><p>Living in an area and being part of a community are two very separate things. For community councils throughout Scotland, the real challenge is often to encourage people in the area to become involved, have their say and get involved with the decisions that will affect them first and foremost. I think that we are getting better at that. I recently attended a community council meeting in Morningside, in Edinburgh, at which there was a discussion about holding a coffee morning in a local community cafe, the sole purpose of which was to let the community know who their community council is and what it can do for them. Like Royston&#8217;s festivals, such proactive steps will make the difference, bring people together and get them involved locally&#8212;particularly those who might otherwise be excluded and find it difficult to interact with and meet their neighbours. It is great to see that Royston is starting that at a young age, with initiatives such as the Toonspeak Young People&#8217;s Theatre.</p><p>With all regeneration projects, there needs to be a tangible sign of success. We must always be sure that they are achieving value for money, and there are indications that the regeneration of Royston will have a lasting and positive impact, not least through the apprenticeships that it has created. Moreover, those apprentices are going to find employment. It is important that such projects leave youngsters with a lasting skill that will open doors for them and increase their employability.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Royston (Regeneration)"}, {"date": "2014-06-24", "body": "<p>It is important to support old businesses, not just new ones. We should not just start new businesses, because the old ones then fail. Regeneration partly concerns restoring old businesses&#8212;restoring premises, raising morale and getting apprenticeships going. That is what I was trying to emphasise.</p><p>Regeneration is often connected with images of large-scale infrastructure projects and a huge amount of investment. However, such projects often fail, due to a lack of community involvement. Time and again we see that regeneration is at its most effective when it involves a collection of small projects, each addressing a specific need or an area where there is a weakness. Bit by bit, such projects succeed in halting decline and begin to reverse it. That action is not always taken on behalf of the community but is, instead, very much led by the community itself. That would seem to be what is happening in Royston, which is why I am delighted that we can celebrate its success in the chamber and that we can take this opportunity to learn from it.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Royston (Regeneration)"}, {"date": "2014-06-18", "body": "<p>Like many members, I well remember the pictures from the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the factory at Rana Plaza. The aspect that sticks most in my mind was the look of sheer confusion on people&#8217;s faces and the general chaos that seemed to characterise the immediate response. Obviously, the scale of the tragedy quickly became apparent and, shortly after, the broader issues with the garment industry came to light. However, since then, the Rana Plaza incident has slipped from the front pages, and that is why I am very pleased that we are having this evening&#8217;s debate.</p><p>Although discussions on the safety of factories in the garment industry, conditions within them and the role of the industry have continued, the issue has received a good deal less attention than we would have expected a tragedy of such scale to have received had it occurred in another country. I congratulate Sarah Boyack and the many other people who are determined not to let the Rana Plaza disaster fade into history, and who are determined to ensure that, whatever else, the lives of the 1,000 or so workers that were lost were not lost in vain.</p><p>We cannot overstress the importance of all our individual responsibilities on the issue. Of course the UK Government should take action on it, and the fact that it has done so is most welcome. The provision of &#163;1.8&#160;million of funding for the trade and global value chains initiative is one such development that should strengthen the relationship between buyers and factory workers. It comes on top of the responsible and accountable garment sector challenge fund, which works with some of our top retailers to improve conditions for workers in the industry.</p><p>However, there is another link in the chain&#8212;ourselves, as consumers. The fact that the garment-marketing rules have been relaxed, thanks mainly to European Union regulations, means that &#8220;country of origin&#8221; labelling is no longer compulsory. That happened as a result of lobbying by the Spanish, who were keen that Mango and Zara should not have to disclose where their garments are manufactured. Since then, it has been nigh on impossible to say whether clothing is made in a foreign sweatshop. Therefore, I think that the kite mark idea is a sound one.</p><p>As someone who worked in the textile industry for long years, I always take a keen interest in where the garments that I buy are manufactured. I find that many people make assumptions about high prices being a marker for quality, but that is not the case. To put it frankly, we cannot make such assumptions. If we are to put pressure on retailers and drive up workers&#8217; conditions, we must start informing ourselves better about the origin of our clothing. I am not talking only about the country of origin, because in all countries there will be factories that are safe to work in and which provide safe and reliable employment. We should not lose sight of that.</p><p>In relation to that, I am pleased that UK aid is providing money for factory inspections in Bangladesh, which I understand will number 2,000 next year, but we can always do more. The problem is that we put money into funds to carry out such factory inspections, but the bosses keep half the money and still pay the workers the minimum wage. It is extremely difficult to control that. As consumers, we should be asking questions about who is producing our clothes, what conditions they are working under and whether the retailer is doing all that it can to support better standards.</p><p>I hope that the increased publicity about compensation of workers surrounding the efforts of some of the companies involved will shame them into becoming more generous and proactive. The fact that so many companies whose goods were manufactured at Rana Plaza failed to attend the first meeting on compensation is shameful, to put it mildly. Those companies must do more, and we must keep up the pressure on them to do so. That goes beyond the issue of compensation, on which progress seems to be being made through the Rana Plaza arrangement, and extends to the broader issue of welfare and conditions for workers, in particular in the developing world. We need to be confident that the cost of our clothes is at the expense of the consumer and not of the welfare of those who make them.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Rana Plaza Disaster (First Anniversary)"}, {"date": "2014-06-17", "body": "<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss strategic planning in the Lothians this evening, and I extend my thanks to those members who added their support to the motion and allowed this issue to be debated.</p><p>I realise that strategic planning is not exactly a subject that sets the heather alight; indeed, I have seen eyes roll when I have mentioned it to my colleagues. However, when we begin to understand the planning system and the significance of the strategic city-based plans within that, the importance of strategic planning is obvious. It profoundly affects how our communities and towns, including Edinburgh, will physically grow in future.</p><p>When I discuss planning with people, I come back to the point that was well made at the Local Government and Regeneration Committee by John Wilson, who noted that most people view the planning system through the prism of their own individual experience with it. Specifically, they become aware of the wider planning system when a development is proposed in their community. The questions that they invariably ask themselves are about who planned the development and who approved it. That is the crux of the planning system, because those questions must be answered relatively straightforwardly and that requires a transparent planning system in which those who make the key decisions can be held to account.</p><p>The importance of the strategic plan is that it answers many of those questions, although perhaps not in a straightforward or transparent manner, along with those for our local development plans, which it also shapes. The housing developments, retail parks and other changes to our communities have their origins rooted in those documents, so their importance can hardly be overstated.</p><p>As we have just finished the consultation exercise on the main issues that will be contained in SESpIan 2 and many local authorities are in the midst of drawing up a new local plan, now would be an opportune moment to review how strategic planning is working. As my motion suggests, the bedrock of a healthy system is community and grass-roots participation in the process. We cannot encourage enough our community councils and other representative bodies to come forward and make themselves heard. However, that in itself is not enough.</p><p>I have introduced today&#8217;s debate to air some of the issues and, frankly, the frustrations that I have heard repeatedly from community councils and local authority councillors across the Lothians and further afield. One of those strikes at the heart of the transparency and accountability agenda, namely the development of the housing land requirement by the strategic planning authority and the use of the housing needs and demand assessment.</p><p>The most recent supplementary guidance has seen a reduction in the housing required for Edinburgh in the short term. Furthermore, I note with interest that reviewed guidance for the conduct of the HNDA was issued earlier this month. However, for many communities that is a small step, given that persistent doubts have been raised about the integrity of the assessment and that people have myriad questions about the process. That is a huge cause of controversy because of the significant pressure that it places on our greenfield sites and, indeed, the green belt. With brownfield sites in the Lothians that were identified in previous local development plans still lying undeveloped and with a significantly lower population than estimated, leading to reduced local government and health board funding in the area, it is easy to see where the frustration and doubts come from.</p><p>I understand that, only last week, representatives from the highly regarded Cockburn Association, which was established to promote conservation in Edinburgh, called into question some of the figures with planners from the City of Edinburgh Council. Those planners appeared to concede that the figures might be awry.</p><p>We must have full confidence in the demand for housing land supply, particularly as communities are being asked to give up valuable green space. I ask the minister to commit this evening to reviewing the targets and their methodology and&#8212;above all&#8212;to ensuring that the process is transparent. He has until only tomorrow to comment on the updated land supply guidance and he should take the opportunity to demand improvements.</p><p>One site that is threatened is Curriemuirend park; almost 500 people have objected to the proposed development there. Plans to invest in facilities for locals have been shelved in anticipation of the site&#8217;s development for housing.</p><p>That raises the question of who locals hold responsible for housing supply figures. They are struggling to find anyone who will take responsibility. When councillors are challenged about the decisions in the local development plan, they point to the Government. When the public raise the matter with their MSP, they are told that the fault lies with the all-powerful strategic plan. I suggest that there is a strong feeling that such plans allow politicians to avoid responsibility for tough decisions.</p><p>It is perhaps time for such significant decisions, particularly on housing, to be formally debated in the Parliament, so that we are clear about where we all stand on them and so that the public can see who is taking the decisions and&#8212;above all&#8212;hold those people to account accordingly. To put it simply, we must stop the blame game and stop politicians running away from their responsibilities.</p><p>That brings me to approval of our local plans. In Edinburgh, serious concerns about the infrastructure implications of several housing developments have been raised. Anyone who knows the level of congestion in the west of the city will understand the plight of residents in Cammo, who have taken the extraordinary step of threatening legal action against the city council.</p><p>More extraordinary still is the response of the city&#8217;s planning convener, Councillor Ian Perry, who suggests that any delay to the development plan would put in danger all of Edinburgh&#8217;s green belt and greenfield sites, which is plainly nonsense. The residents of Cammo and Edinburgh overall deserve a better choice than either a dud plan or uncontrolled and unfettered development of the green belt.</p><p>There are profound questions about the suitability of the local development plan&#8217;s implications for infrastructure. Given that, we should have time to step back and reflect on whether it can be improved but, instead, we face the prospect of its being forced through despite the concerns. I ask the minister to clarify whether he thinks that such advice is appropriate in the circumstances.</p><p>Accountability and transparency are the key aspects of an effective planning system. In the development of SESpIan 2, those two areas must be improved. In the more immediate term, urgent action is needed. I ask the minister again to undertake to reject the housing land supplementary guidance until we have confidence in its figures. I look forward to his comments on the situation in Edinburgh and I hope that he will agree that forcing through approval of a local development plan in such circumstances is in no way appropriate.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Strategic Planning (Lothians)"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p></p><p>1.

How we improve engagement with communities and how we bring them into the decision-making process are fundamental questions that we are all trying to answer. Accordingly, one would hope that if we are successful in that regard and are able to rejuvenate local governance and democracy, a mark of our success would surely be increased voter turnout and participation. Put more succinctly, the consultation should not be seen in isolation, but should be part of a larger process of reform.</p><p>In that regard I have some sympathy for Sarah Boyack&#8217;s amendment, although I must say that the process of centralisation did not magically appear in 2007. When one considers local government ring fencing, it is clear that the tendency to wrestle power away from local authorities was as much in evidence before, under the old regime, as it is now.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p>I accept that. We have to go down to the bottom. We have had a top-down approach, rather than a bottom-up approach.</p><p>Although there is a need for discussion and debate on the broad issues, the pace of the consultation has meant that there has been a focus on the administration of the voting process. However, I happen to think that there is an elephant in the room. It is surely worth considering whether the very system that we use to elect our councillors has any effect, positive or negative, on turnout, and, more broadly, on wider participation and community engagement with councils.</p><p>I accept that this specific consultation is not the mechanism for addressing the issue, but it is time to look at the impact of the single transferable vote system on local government and on local government elections. Indeed, as matters stand with STV, we are considering what we are voting for and why we vote but not how we vote. It makes no sense for us to exclude the issue from the general discussion on the future of local governance in Scotland. In fact, in some respects, this is an ideal time to consider the issue, given that we have now had two elections under STV, with one of those being a stand-alone election&#8212;we should assess the impact that it has on participation.</p><p>When the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 was debated, its proponents told us that it would strengthen democracy, increase choice and reinvigorate local government. I have to ask, has the act delivered all that it was meant to deliver or, rather, have we been left with a system that was complicated as a result of being a compromise between two systems?</p><p>I do not think that the way forward is to have compulsory voting. In Belgium and Australia, where they have compulsory voting, there is a very high percentage of spoilt ballots. I suppose that that is one way of protesting but it serves absolutely no purpose&#8212;there or here. Talking of a duty to vote, there is always a very high turnout in countries that are voting for the first time. That is because it is their duty to vote. I wonder whether we have too many elections. How many times have members been told on the doorstep by many people all over the country&#8212;I will put it politely&#8212;to go and see a taxidermist? I have been told that, even in deepest Renfrewshire. I think that that is really because people are not focused on the whole process.</p><p>To come back to the consultation, my feeling is that it serves to remove barriers to participation from the mechanics of the voting process. As I discussed earlier, there is the bigger task of getting people interested and involved. However, as John Mason said, we probably have to work on that from the bottom up. We have to get people engaged and make it as straightforward as possible for them to vote and also to register to vote, as Sarah Boyack said.</p><p>I am grateful to my colleagues on the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, Anne McTaggart and John Wilson, who undertook to investigate this area last year on the committee&#8217;s behalf. It is not an easy task. While making the process easier, we must ensure that the integrity of the process is maintained; although we do not, by and large, have any great problem with electoral fraud, we should always be vigilant.</p><p>It is worth bearing in mind what we are aiming to achieve and what can be achieved. We are aiming to achieve a higher turnout, with greater participation of people in the electoral process. There are countries such as North Korea in which there is 100 per cent turnout, although we know why that is. Regardless of recent comparisons, I am sure that it is not the Scottish Government&#8217;s aim to replicate North Korea&#8217;s efforts, even if it is granted independence.</p><p>There is a proportion of people on the electoral register who, for one reason or another, should not be there. Indeed, the Electoral Commission told me that it was previously suggested that only 85.5 per cent of the records on the electoral register are accurate. There are many reasons for that, most of which are genuine.</p><p>I welcome the consultation, although I think that it is part of a wider effort. Many other factors must be considered if we are to breathe life back into our local democracy.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p>Will the member take an intervention?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p>Is my friend Dick Lyle suggesting that we sing while we vote?</p><p>On the whole, the debate has been quite constructive. We all agree that we must make it easier for people to participate in our local government elections, and many members have focused on specific areas such as European elections, polling places, the electoral register and online voting.</p><p>John Wilson raised the issue of postal voting. A number of pilots have been rather successful, but the forms are too complicated, and the evidence has shown that there is a disturbing number of spoiled postal ballot papers, which should not happen. We should simplify the postal voting forms. We must also bear in mind that there is a marked difference between a pilot and a full-scale roll-out, and we should be aware of the potential difficulties in carrying out a poll on such a large scale.</p><p>As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we must ensure that robust procedures are in place to protect the integrity of the vote, including security measures. We must be confident that people are able to exercise their right to vote free from coercion.</p><p>A lot of people like going to the polls to vote, and I agree with my colleagues that it is important that we find voting places that are voter friendly&#8212;without, of course, necessarily giving voters a cup of coffee to bribe them for their vote. In Edinburgh, many schools that are used are cold and miserable in winter, which puts people off voting, but the libraries next door are not used. I spoke to someone about that, and they said that it is because there are no janitors and they cannot get people to man them. We need friendlier places to vote, and we should be prepared to think about which current voting places might be unfriendly. However, if we make any changes, they cannot compromise the way in which we conduct our vote.</p><p>Another aspect that many members mentioned is the need to ensure that voters understand the voting system. They need to know what they are voting for and understand the responsibilities of local government, which is not always the case. We all know that, when we go round the doorsteps, whatever the election, people talk about things that are not necessarily relevant. If it is a local election, they talk about Europe; if it is a European election, they talk about local stuff. We have to try and engage with them on those aspects.</p><p>This is my opinion, but I am very much in favour of 16 and 17-year-olds being allowed to vote. We should encourage that. After all, as colleagues have said, they can do everything else, so they should be allowed to vote in all elections. I really think that we should get that done. [Applause.] I am not sure that my party necessarily agrees with that, however. [Laughter.] I can say it here and I cannot be corrected. It is right to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote because, after all, it has been proved that most of the enthusiasm is among the young people. When I get out there, I find that they are keen. Some people in council estates and so on are just not engaged, but the younger people seem to think that voting is relevant. To be fair, it is novel for them, too. I am all in favour of that.</p><p>One key aspect of the new curriculum for excellence is developing responsible citizens. Encouraging democratic participation should surely play a large part in our children&#8217;s education. As Sarah Boyack said, it is children in school who really engage. When schools visit the Parliament, it is the 10, 11 and 12-year olds who really like it and who are keen to know what is happening, even in a non-political way. That is important. I noticed with interest the comment of Dumfries and Galloway Council that the education system could help to embed the importance of voting from an early age. That is key.</p><p>In considering the curriculum for excellence, we have to move beyond the perfunctory voter information campaign drives and dry leaflets. Schools must consider the role that they play in the process with children from a young age. We make the stuff too dry and complicated.</p><p>As I said in my opening remarks, the consultation is part of a wider process. Sarah Boyack&#8217;s amendment, which I will definitely vote for, is correct that, if we are to genuinely re-engage the public with local government, we must make it relevant. However, the consultation is about what we can do to improve the process of voting and make it easier for those who already want to take part.</p><p>An important message from the debate is that there are no quick fixes. It is interesting to note that, in Belgium, where voting is compulsory, turnout had been at 89 per cent but the figure dropped for the European elections because people did not think that it was relevant and just spoiled their ballot papers. They went into the polling station and either tore up the paper or wrote rubbish on it, as sometimes happens here. I try to persuade people that spoiling their ballot paper is a waste, because nobody pays attention to it. People think that they are making a protest vote, but we do not put those protests aside&#8212;they just go straight into a bucket. We have to persuade people that there is no point in going to vote and spoiling their ballot paper.</p><p>A good deal of work needs to be done to engage the public. It might take quite a bit of time for that work to bear fruit, but it is important that we do all that we can to make the system easier while preserving the integrity of local government voting. Fraud is an important issue. We all know that people go round houses and say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll fill in the ballot paper for you.&#8221; There might be about six ballot papers, and they are all filled in. That is part of the problem that we might never get round.</p><p>I do not know whether online voting will work. It should work, but I must say that I cannot really see it working. People want the traditional method and the postal vote&#8212;they do not want too many complicated types of voting. When we had three types of voting in 2007, or whenever it was, that was a failure. There were masses of spoiled papers. In Edinburgh, it was a total disaster.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p>I am just about to close now, thank you very much&#8212;that is enough.</p><p>We have to preserve the integrity of the vote.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p>Will the minister take an intervention?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-06-05", "body": "<p>I add my congratulations to Aberdeen City Council on its formal engagement strategy, and I congratulate Kitaoka-san on coming here today.</p><p>My experience is not particularly with the north-east or Aberdeen, but I have led two trade missions to Japan in my former roles with the Scottish Council for Development and Industry and the UK Fashion and Textile Corporation.

However, it is clear that so many of the issues that have cropped up go beyond regeneration and touch on other areas of our work&#8212;in particular, things such as flexibility in local government and community empowerment. Bearing that in mind, it appears that the lessons that have been learned could positively affect regeneration and far wider policy areas.</p><p>One of the first such lessons became apparent during our visit to Whitfield in Dundee, on the very day when I joined the committee. As the report makes clear, regeneration has existed as a concept for a very long time, and in recent years all Governments have invested time and money in regeneration policies in a bid to reverse real and lasting deprivation and decline. However, although that investment was undoubtedly well-intentioned, we must accept that it has not always been successful; indeed, there have been some total failures. Investment in and of itself will not deliver long-term improvements or reverse long-term decline. Of course, funding is needed, but in recent years there have not been the resources that there were previously That means that when funding does become available, we should spend it wisely and monitor it closely to ensure that it is being fully utilised.</p><p>There are plenty of examples of regeneration projects throughout Scotland that have delivered meaningful change, and which could be considered as genuine success stories. I would like to highlight one or two aspects that have struck me. First, not all those success stories were large scale; Blue Sea Consulting argued in its written submission that small projects with a fixed level of funding and clear short-term objectives are often very successful. The role of such projects should not be overlooked when we are considering our regeneration strategy.</p><p>We need to move beyond the idea that regeneration means completion of one large-scale infrastructure project after another&#8212;particularly given how many large-scale projects fail to be completed or suffer huge delays, for a variety of reasons.</p><p>I was also struck by the submission by PARC Craigmillar, which has pursued a piecemeal approach to regeneration and, as a starting point, worked hard to establish what were the existing needs and demands in Craigmillar. Far too many regeneration projects have attempted to generate both the demand and the supply. That is almost like the Kevin Costner syndrome of, &#8220;Build it and they will come.&#8221; As I said in committee, retail units are often built despite there being long-established shops nearby and no evidence that there is demand for more. The hope is that the new units will bring custom and greater investment but, years later, those shops still lie empty. Shops are often built because developers see it as an easy way of making money through shop rents, which means that little thought is given to the mix of shop types&#8212;for instance, there is often a high concentration of charity and betting shops. That approach to regeneration is simplistic and&#8212;I am afraid&#8212;it rarely succeeds.</p><p>The strength of a phased approach is that it meets the existing needs in a community and can adapt to future developments. That is at the heart of the regeneration issue. Regeneration can take any number of forms and be of any scale, but community engagement is a must. As the committee report makes clear, the extent to which communities are involved with the decision-making process varies markedly among communities and even among projects, depending on who is delivering them. There seems to be some denial of that fact, but from the various community groups from which we heard there was a clear and consistent message about the perception of being excluded. In particular, the failings of the CPPs have been exposed in that regard, so we must have action to ensure that local communities are meaningfully involved, and we must move beyond consultations that are merely tick-the-box exercises. As the committee convener stated, it is the people who matter.</p><p>When we consider what regeneration means in its broadest sense, we find that a core group who must be engaged are local businesses and entrepreneurs. Again, the success stories are projects that identified the needs of businesses or identified barriers to their growth and helped them to overcome them. When local businesses attract employment and investment into an area, the success is shared locally, which is the key to sustainable development and reversing long-term decay. As Scottish Enterprise suggested in its evidence, investment is at its most effective when it is used to pump-prime locally based economic development.</p><p>Our report highlights barriers to community engagement that must be overcome. Although I hate this policy wonk phrase, there is undoubtedly a need for &#8220;capacity building&#8221; in communities in order to encourage participation in the design and running of services. Communities must be able to articulate their priorities and to affect the system. Far too often, bodies or small groups of individuals assume that role on behalf of a community, but that is not sustainable not only because those groups do not always reflect totally what is in the best interests of the areas that they serve, but because communities must be able to hold to account those who make decisions and distribute resources on their behalf.</p><p>There are already a number of regeneration success stories out there. We must learn the lessons of the report, put the community at the heart of our future strategy and reconcile ourselves to the various forms of regeneration that that will bring.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}], "title": "", "house": "4", "lastupdate": "2015-04-17 22:32:03", "person_id": "25219", "entered_reason": "replaced_in_region", "full_name": "Cameron Buchanan", "member_id": "80543", "entered_house": "2013-09-04", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "Lothian"}], [{"left_reason": "still_in_office", "first_name": "Cara", "last_name": "Hilton", "left_house": "9999-12-31", "debates": [{"date": "2014-08-12", "body": "<p>I thank Drew Smith for securing this timely debate. First, I declare an interest as a member of the cross-party group on Palestine and as a member of the Scottish Palestine solidarity campaign.</p><p>Five months ago, we debated the thirsting for justice campaign on water shortages in Gaza. I talked about how the Israeli Government has condemned a whole generation of children to a future that is bleak at the very best. Five months on and, for many of those children, that bleak future is no future at all.</p><p>Many families have been literally torn apart or wiped out entirely. Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s example brought tears to my eyes. We have seen 456 children killed, thousands more who have been injured and 400,000 who face psychological damage. The lives of the children who thought they were safe when they sheltered in a UN school were tragically cut short when they were killed in their sleep by Israeli missiles. The UN warned the Israelis 17 times that that was a UN shelter, yet the Israeli military carried on with that shameful act. Despite the outcry, even from the United States of America, a further five UN shelters have been targeted by the Israeli military.</p><p>Children playing football on the beach have been shot at from an Israeli gunship. Children playing on the swings at their play park have been killed by Israeli gunfire. Children have seen everyone they loved wiped out. In the current assault, the innocent children of Gaza are caught up in a nightmare that they simply cannot escape.</p><p>I condemn the violence on all sides, but this is not a conflict that has any balance. This is about a brutal Israeli Government, which is in breach of countless UN resolutions, which is illegally occupying Palestinian land, which is continuing to bulldoze Palestinian homes, and which for seven years has blockaded the people of Gaza from all sides, denying them access to clean water and medical supplies, denying people their human rights and even denying children the right to a childhood.</p><p>I was pleased recently to join the 700 people in Kirkcaldy who marched in solidarity with families in Gaza. I am also proud that this week Fife Council is flying the Palestinian flag in solidarity with the families in Gaza who are under attack, because enough is enough. It is not about taking sides; it is about humanity.</p><p>As consumers, we have power. When we do our supermarket shop, we should use that power to boycott Israeli goods. In any case, why should we in the UK buy Israeli potatoes when we can buy perfectly good Scottish potatoes from down the road? Consumer power played a huge role in ending the apartheid regime in South Africa, and we can bring about change in Palestine.</p><p>It is time for the UK Government to end its virtual silence and use its economic influence to tell Israel that enough is enough. As Alex Rowley said, the UK sold &#163;6.3 million pounds&#8217; worth of arms to Israel last year. The revelation that military equipment that was made in Fife might have been used against children in Gaza was certainly a shock to me as a Fife MSP. No company in Fife, Scotland or elsewhere in the UK should be supplying the brutal Israeli Government with arms or military equipment. We need an arms embargo and we need an investigation into why our factories are supplying a country that shows absolutely no respect for international law, human rights and the rights of children.</p><p>We need a solution that not only ends the current violence but secures justice for the Palestinian people, with an end to Israel&#8217;s illegal siege of Gaza and an end to the illegal occupation of Palestinian land. We need a solution whereby people who have committed shameful acts of terror, such as the bombing of schools and hospitals, are held to account for the war crimes that they committed.</p><p>Nelson Mandela said:</p><p>&#8220;We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.&#8221;</p><p>It is time for Scotland and the UK to use our influence to secure justice and freedom for the Palestinian people.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p></p><p>4.

She has a long history of championing breastfeeding, both inside and outside Parliament, and the debate is timely. When the Breastfeeding etc (Scotland) Bill was passed, back in 2004, Elaine Smith said:</p><p>&#8220;the bill is not an end, but the beginning of the Parliament pursuing practical ways to support and encourage breastfeeding.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 18 November 2004; c 12118.]</p><p>That was also the year in which I first became a mum. I still remember being annoyed that I was kept in hospital for four nights after my son was born, until I could get breastfeeding established. The other mums in the ward were all formula feeding and went home the next day, but I was determined to breastfeed even though it was a lot harder than I imagined it would be. Looking back, I see that my longer stay in hospital was vital in ensuring that I could breastfeed my son, who was exclusively breastfed for the first six months&#8212;at least, that was what I thought until my mum told me later that she had given him some ice cream. I have since breastfed my other two children. Most recently, I breastfed my youngest, who was seven weeks premature and was breastfed through a tube until he was able to manage himself.</p><p>I have to confess that the idea of feeding them in public always filled me with dread. Like many mums, I would plan my day to avoid being out at feeding time, and I have to admit that I always felt slightly envious of my bottle-feeding friends, who could be out all day without any worry.</p><p>To be fair, leaving home after having a first child is always a challenge&#8212;for the first six months, I think that it was lunch time before I would get out&#8212;but it can be even more of a challenge when the person is breastfeeding. In fact, research suggests that half of United Kingdom women who have breastfed in public have had at least one negative experience.</p><p>Despite the widespread recognition that breast is best, it is virtually impossible in many places and many of our communities to feed a baby in public without people staring and without attracting both verbal and non-verbal signs of disapproval. Sadly, those negative reactions lead too many mums to stop breastfeeding altogether.</p><p>I was shocked to read about the experiences of Emily Slough, who was thrown out of Sports Direct for breastfeeding her eight-month-old baby. Worse still, she was subjected to abuse on social media, labelled a &#8220;tramp&#8221; and subjected to a host of shocking comments just for feeding her baby. One person suggested that it would be &#8220;more dignified&#8221; if she breastfed in a public toilet. Emily fought back and organised a mass breastfeeding protest. Thousands of mums came out in support of her across the UK, and many more signed an online petition that demanded that Sports Direct apologise and stop discriminating against breastfeeding mums.</p><p>Although mums here are protected by the Breastfeeding etc (Scotland) Act 2005, as Elaine Smith mentioned, many women are simply unaware that that vital protection exists. The act makes it a criminal offence to stop or to attempt to stop mums breastfeeding in public. Given the recent outcry, surely the time is now right to do more to publicise that landmark legislation, and to send out the message that mums in Scotland who want to breastfeed in public have the full protection of the law behind them. I hope that the minister will consider that, because it is absolutely vital that we do more to promote breastfeeding to mums from all backgrounds, across Scotland.</p><p>We have had many debates in the chamber about child poverty and inequality. One of the best ways to tackle health inequalities and to give children the best start in life is through breastfeeding. However, breastfeeding rates have remained largely static for the past decade. Half of mums breastfeed at 10 days and only one in four mums breastfeeds exclusively six to eight weeks later. Nine out of 10 women who stop breastfeeding before their baby is six weeks old say that they would like to have breastfed for longer.</p><p>Often, mums just need a bit more support and more information. Breastfeeding support groups are absolutely vital in that context. That is especially important for mums in more deprived areas, where breastfeeding rates are among the lowest, mums are often younger, and there is less likely to be a family history of breastfeeding. We too often hear mums being told, &#8220;Just give the wee one a bottle, so you can get a rest,&#8221; and breastfeeding mums are too often made to feel that their milk alone is not enough to sustain a large or hungry baby, when that is simply not true.</p><p>It is absolutely vital that the Scottish Government addresses that important public health issue by doing more to promote the health benefits to mums and babies, by ensuring that every mum can access the peer and professional support that they need and&#8212;perhaps most important&#8212;by promoting and celebrating breastfeeding in shops, cafes, libraries, parks and public places throughout Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Breastfeeding"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p>The outcomes of local elections shape our lives in many ways, from how our local schools are organised to when our bins are collected, yet an increasing number of people are opting not to take part in our local democracy. The 20 per cent drop in the turnout for local elections since 1999, which colleagues have talked about, is a huge concern, and it is vital that measures are taken both to halt and to reverse that decline.</p><p>Derek Mackay and Sarah Boyack have highlighted the fact that the level of participation is falling fast among the young and the poorest voters. That is of huge concern. It is an issue not just for local elections but for all elections, and we will address it only with radical solutions. We have all knocked on doors and been told, &#8220;I never vote because politics doesn&#8217;t affect me&#8221; or, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about politics.&#8221;</p><p>The issue is not just voter apathy. Many people have such busy lives that they are not able to get to the polling stations on election day. As John Mason said, many polling stations are in the wrong place. We must do a lot more to make voting as easy and accessible as possible. Moving to universal postal voting and same-day registration may help, but there are lots of other avenues that we can go down.</p><p>It is sometimes hard for voters to tell that there is an election going on. During the European Parliament elections, I knocked on quite a few doors on election day and people told me that they had no idea that an election was being held on that day. The fact that election posters on lamp posts are banned in many areas may be a bonus for party workers, but it is certainly not a bonus when it comes to raising awareness of elections. With many of us targeting core voters and swing voters, less time is now spent on persuading the reluctant or cynical to get out and vote. I therefore welcome the Electoral Commission&#8217;s recommendation that discussions should take place on how we can better publicise the 2017 council elections, and I hope that those discussions can be progressed.</p><p>If we are to engage young voters, it is absolutely vital that politics and elections play a much bigger part in the school curriculum. That has been proposed by the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, and I hope that the Scottish Government will do more work to make it a reality. The IPPR report &#8220;Divided Democracy: Political inequality in the UK and why it matters&#8221; suggests that voting be made compulsory for voters&#8212;an idea that my colleague Cameron Buchanan mentioned. The report argues that if young people vote in their first election they are more likely to vote throughout their lives, and if more young people vote, their voices will be more difficult for politicians to ignore. That is also an issue that we need to explore.</p><p>Like all members, I spend a lot of time visiting schools and speaking to school children about democracy and the work of our Parliament. I hope that, when it is their turn to vote, we will see a change, as the young people that I speak to are informed and interested in politics. Most of the young people that I speak to on their doorstep about the referendum are also really excited about being able to cast their vote for the first time on 18 September.</p><p>However, it is a lot easier to enthuse people to vote in an election that has the power to change their lives radically, for better or worse. It is harder to get people to the local government polls when many people see councils as being just about bins and street lights rather than as having the power to shape and change our local communities. It also does not help that many councillors simply do not look anything like the communities that they represent, as Anne McTaggart said. Although progress has been made, the fact is that women and young people, in particular, remain seriously underrepresented on local councils across Scotland. All political parties need to take action to address the issue, which is unhealthy for democracy. Three out of four of our local councillors are men. The image of councillors being pale, male and stale may be a generalisation&#8212;I mean no offence to Richard Lyle&#8212;but it is often the reality. A recent report by the Asda mums index found that only 2 per cent of mums feel politically represented. That is not good for democracy. Whether they are on the councils, here at Holyrood or at Westminster, our elected representatives need to better reflect the communities that they serve.</p><p>We often hear SNP members say that one of the bonuses of independence will be that we will get the Government that we vote for. The reality is that, in many elections, the majority of people do not vote at all. We spend a huge amount of time in the chamber debating whether we should be part of the UK and we do not spend enough time looking at where the power should lie here in Scotland. Therefore, although I welcome the report, I hope that it can lead to change. We need to renew our local democracy and be more ambitious about putting power back into our local communities and into the hands of local people.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-06-10", "body": "<p>If we look at emissions by sector, we see that agriculture has the second highest, at 11.2 per cent.

Across the political divide, we all agree that action needs to be taken, and childcare is rightly rising to the top of the political agenda. That is welcome news to women across all political parties who have been making the case for childcare for many decades&#8212;a case that has often fallen on deaf ears in Parliaments and council chambers that have been full of men.</p><p>I am pleased that childcare is now at the heart of the mainstream political agenda, where it belongs, but for mums and dads the pace of change is too slow. We are still waiting for a childcare revolution, and parents deserve better than childcare promises that are simply uncosted and unworkable, or are taking too long to deliver.</p><p>Whatever the result in September, we have the powers at Holyrood to transform childcare in Scotland now, and we need to use them&#8212;not just talk about them. Our priority must be to ensure that childcare is free or affordable for every parent and, as childcare challenges do not end when children start school, that must include childcare for schoolchildren, too.</p><p>In Scotland, we have waited seven long years for the SNP&#8217;s 2007 childcare pledge to be met. Finally in August, Scottish parents will catch up with their friends and family in England and Wales. That is an overdue, but welcome, step forward.</p><p>Pre-school provision will also be extended to workless families of two-year-olds. That policy is welcome, but comes with challenges because local authorities tell us that the new childcare pledge is not fully funded. Given how important childcare is in addressing the cycle of disadvantage, that is surely a big concern. Fife Council, for example, has identified a funding gap of about &#163;500,000; that does not even factor in adaptations that need to be made to pre-school facilities to cater for two-year-olds.</p><p>I also know from speaking to early years workers in my constituency that there are real concerns about a reduction in the quality of early education for our two, three and four-year-olds as a result of the 600 hours provision, because there will be less time for planning and setting up the nursery area and less opportunity to discuss the needs and development of individual children.</p><p>It is crucial that the Scottish Government and local authorities provide the right funding and support to ensure that all our pre-school children continue to receive high-quality childcare, especially given that curriculum for excellence starts at age 3. The OECD&#8217;s evidence shows that low-quality childcare can damage outcomes for children, so we need to monitor that carefully, especially in our more deprived communities, where high-quality childcare can make a huge difference to children&#8217;s lives.</p><p>Delivering 600 hours of free nursery education is not exactly the childcare revolution that mums and dads are waiting for; it is not enough to transform lives. Parents in the rest of the UK have had that level of free childcare since 2010. With parents across Scotland spending a huge proportion of their hard-earned incomes on childcare, urgent action is needed now to ensure that every family can overcome the childcare challenges that they face.</p><p>Childcare costs continue to rise much faster than inflation, and certainly much faster than wages. Many families spend more on childcare than on their rent, mortgage and fuel bills combined, and the costs continue to spiral. As a couple of colleagues have already pointed out, a nursery place now costs 30 per cent more now than it did in 2010. Working full time is simply not an option for most mums of young children; only 24 per cent of mums of three-year-olds and four-year-olds work full time.</p><p>The cost of a full-time childcare place for one child is almost &#163;8,000 a year. Is it any wonder that so many parents find that they simply have to turn down jobs or reduce their hours, or that they are forced to abandon their career plans because of sky-high childcare costs? A Save the Children report found that 80 per cent of the poorest families say that cost is the main barrier to accessing childcare and getting back into work. Some families are locked out of the labour market entirely, and many families manage only by constant juggling, by working different hours to cover childcare, or by relying on friends, grandparents, and even next-door neighbours.</p><p>Elsewhere in Europe, men are more likely to reduce their hours in order to share childcare responsibilities, but in Scotland in 2014, many employers still view childcare as a mum&#8217;s responsibility and fail to consider the growing needs of working dads who also want to balance work and family life. In that context, the Scottish Government&#8217;s pledge to transform childcare after a yes vote does seem to be attractive; if only there was any evidence at all that it could be delivered.</p><p>The reality is that the SNP&#8217;s sums simply do not add up. The pledge is based on Scotland having 40,000 more pre-school mums who are able to return to work than even exist. SPICe has estimated that the pledge will cost an additional &#163;1.2&#160;billion at least to finance, and it still has not been backed up by any financial modelling, despite the policy&#8217;s being one of the key highlights of the white paper.</p><p>Parents have waited long enough. They deserve better than a childcare policy that has been questioned by the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s own team of impartial experts. It is time for the Scottish Government to publish the full costings of its childcare plans, and for us all to put aside our political differences and work together to transform childcare for mums, dads, carers, and grandparents across Scotland. Our proposal for a childcare commission would give us that opportunity.</p><p>Parents want real action on childcare. They are fed up with being treated as political pawns. Whatever the result of the referendum, we already have the powers at Holyrood to deliver on childcare. Let us use those powers now, and let us work together to develop a comprehensive strategy for childcare that does not end when a child starts school. Let us bring about a childcare revolution that will transform the lives of working parents. Let us end the childcare headache that has simply been endured by working parents across Scotland for too long. Now is the time to deliver a childcare system for Scotland that supports all our parents and gives all our children the very best start in life.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-05-20", "body": "<p>I thank Kenneth Gibson for securing the debate on tackling the stigma of epilepsy through education. As we have heard, epilepsy has a huge impact on people&#8217;s lives. It affects 1 per cent of the population and many of us will have a friend or a family member who is affected. For me, it is my mum, who was diagnosed with epilepsy six years ago but had been suffering from what she calls &#8220;funny feelings&#8221; for a couple of years before that. She was stunned to be told that she had epilepsy, but she is now on medication, is seizure free and, most important for her, she is back at the steering wheel and can get herself out and about.</p><p>Epilepsy is a condition that varies considerably. There are at least 40 different types of seizures. While people&#8217;s experience of the condition varies, those affected have got one thing in common: every day, people with epilepsy experience stigma, prejudice and discrimination. Having epilepsy can be a lonely and isolating experience that destroys confidence and self-esteem.</p><p>Colleagues have highlighted the Quarriers research, which found that 55 per cent of sufferers said that they were treated differently when people found out about their epilepsy. Many keep quiet, not just because of the prejudice that they face but because of general public ignorance about epilepsy. When my mum first found out that she had epilepsy, in common with 43 per cent of sufferers she tried to keep quiet about her condition. When she felt brave enough to speak out, she found that many people simply changed the subject and moved on to talk about the weather instead. Others would panic, worried that she would have a seizure at any minute and wondering whether they would cope if she did.</p><p>Is it any wonder that so many people with epilepsy suffer in silence when a shocking 28 per cent of epilepsy sufferers have been laughed at as a result of having a seizure? A third of epilepsy sufferers worry about leaving the house in case they have a seizure in public, 72 per cent say that their condition has affected their career prospects and 7 per cent say that they have been photographed or filmed when having a seizure. A former chief executive of Quarriers said:</p><p>&#8220;It appears we are stuck in the dark ages over how to treat people living with epilepsy&#8221;.</p><p>We have huge challenges ahead. It is unacceptable that in 21st century Scotland people living with epilepsy are living in fear of ridicule and discrimination.</p><p>Things are not much better for between 5,000 and 7,000 children and young people who have active epilepsy. A survey of school children found that, for over half of them, being thought of as different or being teased by others&#8212;not the seizures themselves&#8212;was the worst part of epilepsy. I was quite shocked to read in the excellent briefing provided by Allana Parker that 31 per cent of young adults were concerned that epilepsy might be contagious. That really highlights how much more needs to be done to raise awareness of epilepsy in our schools, workplaces and communities.</p><p>I commend the stamp out stigma awareness-raising campaign, which will provide study materials on glow for class teachers and secondary school pupils. The campaign has been developed in line with the curriculum for excellence by members of the Scottish Youth Parliament. I hope that when it rolls out in the autumn it will go a long way towards raising awareness in our schools, improving support for children and young adults with epilepsy and, perhaps most important, changing people&#8217;s attitudes and perceptions. I hope that classes in my constituency and across Scotland will sign up for it.</p><p>A big concern for me, which Kenneth Gibson has highlighted, is the lack of adequate first aid training for pupils and staff in our schools, with many schools waiting until a child is diagnosed before putting training measures in place. Given that seizures can develop at any age and at any time, surely it would be better to ensure that every single school has a first aider who is trained to deal with epilepsy. I would therefore welcome the minister&#8217;s comments on what action the Scottish Government can take to move this forward so that staff in all our local authorities and all our schools are better able to assist children with epilepsy.</p><p>I would also welcome the minister&#8217;s comments on what measures the Scottish Government plans to take to raise public awareness and address the stigma that continues to undermine everyone of every age who is affected by epilepsy. The see me campaign has been really effective in tackling mental health stigma. Would the minister consider supporting a similar campaign to address the stigma of epilepsy?</p><p>I hope that during national epilepsy week we can together go some way towards reversing the negative perceptions that surround epilepsy. It is time to stamp out the stigma.

Although the park and ride is in his Cowdenbeath constituency, Halbeath village is in my constituency and the facility is accessed by a large number of my constituents across Dunfermline and west Fife.</p><p>Halbeath is rapidly growing and changing. Hundreds of new houses are being built right next to Halbeath village and many more are in the pipeline for the nearby Shepherd Offshore site and the wider Duloch area&#8212;I recently met representatives of the NHBC, who told me that there are more house completions in that area than in any other part of Scotland. Although that is good news for my constituency, the current infrastructure, including schools and transport links, has struggled to keep pace with the change.</p><p>One of the biggest issues that constituents are raising with me is difficulty in parking at train stations. Most car parks in the area are full by 8 o&#8217;clock in the morning, making it difficult for people to access train services into Edinburgh and beyond. Many commuters from across Fife and Perthshire park at Inverkeithing train station, which is struggling to cope with the demand. For many of my constituents, there is no option but to face the traffic and drive across the Forth bridge.</p><p>As Alex Rowley said, 23 million vehicles cross the Forth road bridge every year, which is around 30,000 a day from Monday to Friday every week. Transport Scotland has found that 29 per cent of all journeys that are made across the Forth bridge start at Dunfermline, with the majority being made by people who are commuting into the Edinburgh area for work. That flow will only increase as Dunfermline&#8217;s population continues to expand, with people taking advantage not only of Dunfermline being a fantastic place to live but of house prices there being substantially lower than in the Edinburgh area.</p><p>At Halbeath park and ride, there are 1,000 car parking spaces. It is already a popular transport hub that caters for those who want to park and ride, and for those who want to car share. It could be much more. Halbeath&#8217;s location, just off the M90/A90/A92 corridor and the Fife railway circle, means that it is ideally placed&#8212;as Alex Rowley said&#8212;to be one of Scotland&#8217;s key multimodal transport interchanges. A train station and rail halt at Halbeath would be a huge boost for my constituents in Dunfermline, for Fife and for Scotland. It would be a real boost for our local economy, local jobs and local businesses, and it would provide much-needed infrastructure to support the ever-growing eastern expansion in my constituency as well as the new expansion that is planned for the north of Dunfermline. It would also make public transport more accessible and a more viable alternative, improving journey times into Edinburgh and beyond not just for Fifers, but for everyone travelling by train between Aberdeen, Inverness, Perth and Edinburgh. Crucially, it would help in the drive to ensure that Scotland meets its ambitious climate change targets, reducing air pollution levels and carbon emissions.</p><p>Linked to that development must be an investment in making Halbeath park and choose more accessible to pedestrians. I commend the excellent work of Living Streets Scotland, which has been working closely with the Halbeath tenants and residents association in my constituency to improve the environment for pedestrians of all ages and abilities. One of the key long-term issues raised by local residents is access to the Halbeath facility. Currently, unless they travel there by car or bus, there is simply no safe way for local residents to get there from Halbeath or from the Duloch area.</p><p>Both Transport Scotland and Fife Council need to do more to make the Halbeath facility a genuine travel option for many of my constituents who either do not have a car or simply want to leave the car at home. One of the six Transport Scotland objectives for the ScotRail franchise is to improve accessibility to services and stations, so it is absolutely vital that any plans for a new railway station include well-lit walking routes that allow the community on its doorstep to walk or cycle there safely.</p><p>Clearly, as Alex said, it all comes at a cost, but I believe that it is an investment that the Scottish Government should be prepared to make and one that would deliver real returns, not just for Fife but for Scotland. It is time to be more ambitious for our railways and for the public transport, cycling and walking network across Scotland. Alex has already asked the minister to commit to ensuring that the funding is in place to make that a reality, and I echo his request. I hope that the minister will confirm that the funding and timescale for that vital and strategically important project will be put in place, because it will make a huge difference, not just to the Fife economy and to Fife commuters, but to Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Halbeath Park and Ride"}, {"date": "2014-04-23", "body": "<p>The biggest concern for families across Scotland is not constitutional change but whether they have enough money in their pockets from one week to the next. For the average family, wages are down, tax credits have been cut and child benefit has been frozen while food prices, fuel bills and childcare costs continue to soar. The cost of living crisis is not a soundbite but a daily reality. For many, the opportunities that they had hoped their children would have seem beyond reach, and for too many workers, young and old, the only jobs on offer are insecure and poorly paid, with few hours guaranteed.</p><p>Last week, a constituent told me that, at 40 years old, he had given up hope of finding what he called a proper job, and the only way he could make ends meet and keep a roof over his family&#8217;s head was to take agency work.

None of us should tolerate that low-pay loophole.</p><p>The Government invests &#163;10 billion a year in procurement. That is a huge sum of public money, and it is time that the Government used its spending power to ensure that no company that pays its workers less than the living wage is awarded a public sector contract in Scotland.

Two thirds of those who earn less than the living wage are women. Low pay hits women hardest and equal pay is still a long way off. If inclusion and equality are really, as the First Minister said yesterday, at the heart of everything that the Government does, why does it not act now to transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of workers, the vast majority of whom are women?</p><p>The First Minister also said that the glass ceiling has cracked in Scotland, but the reality for thousands of women workers in Dunfermline and across Scotland is of being trapped in a cycle of low-pay, low-skill jobs with few prospects for promotion.

It is an absolute scandal that in 21st century Scotland our children&#8217;s life chances are largely determined by their circumstances at birth. As colleagues have already pointed out, although we are one of the world&#8217;s richest countries, we are also one of the most unequal, with one in five of our children living in poverty.</p><p>Across the UK, the number of children living in poverty will rise from 2.4&#160;million in 2010 to 3.4&#160;million by 2020, by which time another 100,000 children in Scotland will be in poverty. I highlight the UK figures, because child poverty does not stop at the border and is not just an issue in Scotland. I want an end to child poverty not just in Dunfermline and Dundee, but in Durham and Doncaster.</p><p>Every family in the UK is paying the price of austerity. We are all facing a cost of living crisis that is deeper than we could have imagined and, as we all know, it is the poorest families and children who are being hit the hardest. The daily reality for more and more children is going to school with an empty belly, missing out on the school trips that their classmates go on, not having proper school shoes or a warm winter coat, and not having the same opportunities either now or in the future.</p><p>That cycle of disadvantage will last their whole lives. By the age of three, children from deprived backgrounds are already nine months behind; by the age of six, lower-achieving children from better-off backgrounds are outperforming higher-achieving children from poorer families; and by primary 7, the gap in attainment between children in poverty and their better-off peers is 22 per cent in reading and 15 per cent in maths. Such differentials persist throughout school and beyond, with one in five school leavers from deprived backgrounds going straight into unemployment compared with one in 10 of their better-off peers. Behind every one of those statistics is a child whose life chances have been shaped not by their ability to learn, but by the poverty that they have endured.</p><p>Most scandalous of all is that the majority of those children in poverty have parents who are working&#8212;and who are working harder than ever. Mums who have two or three jobs on short-time and zero-hours contracts are struggling to make ends meet, and dads are working 40, 50 or even 60 hours a week, but are still not earning a living wage. Unable to afford childcare and fighting to keep a roof over their families&#8217; heads, many are turning to food banks as the only way to put food on the table. Many more are suffering the health consequences of living in damp or overcrowded housing, and let us not forget the mental impact of stress, anxiety and worry.

I certainly think that we need to be a lot more ambitious. I highlight an excellent initiative that will shortly be launched in my Dunfermline constituency. It involves a free breakfast cafe being provided for children in Lynburn primary school, which is in the Abbeyview area. The area has one of the highest levels of multiple deprivation in Scotland. When I visit schools in my constituency, teachers tell me that the biggest problem is children coming to school hungry. One teacher told me that as many as one in four children in her class turns up hungry, and she has to give them breakfast cereal when they arrive. How is a child supposed to learn when he or she has not even had their breakfast?</p><p>If we are effectively to tackle disadvantage and poverty, it is essential that we target our help at the communities where it is needed most and where it will deliver the greatest benefit. I mentioned earlier that low pay is a huge issue that many families in poverty face. As I said in my response to Mr Allard, my constituents in Dunfermline want to know why, while they talk about tackling child poverty, SNP MSPs voted against Labour amendments that would have delivered a living wage for workers in public sector contracts. Ensuring that people have a living wage is essential if we are to tackle child poverty, and it is time that the Scottish Government used the powers that it already has to make that a reality.</p><p>The fact is that child poverty is about choices; we will tackle child poverty only if it is our number 1 priority. What we need is a redistribution of power and wealth, not a change to our borders and our constitution.</p><p>No child should be born to fail.

They are undermining social justice, too, because it is society&#8217;s most vulnerable&#8212;the sick, the young and the elderly&#8212;who are most at risk from exposure to dangerous air pollution levels and who are most likely to suffer health consequences as a result of our failure to act.</p><p>After smoking, the biggest public health risk that we face is from the very air that we breathe.

What the whole affair has cried out for is honest brokers, and such organisations have performed that role.</p><p>A number of terms have been repeated throughout the debate, one of which is &#8220;disproportionate&#8221;. I certainly view the actions of the Israeli defence force as disproportionate, but I am concerned that that might suggest that, if there had been less bombing and less abuse hurled at the Gazan population, that would have been acceptable. As other members have done, I am happy to say unreservedly that violence from whatever quarter is unacceptable.</p><p>The term &#8220;indiscriminate&#8221; has been used, too, but I am not sure that Israeli soldiers writing in children&#8217;s school books in schools that they have destroyed and writing the names of their regiments on classroom walls are anything other than calculated acts. I worry that that is part of a wider contempt for the mere existence of the Gazan community.</p><p>The arms industry is pernicious worldwide, and it has been heavily involved in the conflict. The Israeli Government has a wonderful test centre of Gazan guinea pigs or sitting ducks right on its doorstep. It is my view that there are sick minds at play. We do not need new weapons; as my colleague Claudia Beamish said, we do not need so-called smart weapons. We saw at first hand one of the consequences of those so-called smart weapons&#8212;the deaths of 11 members of one family in a very confined area.

Some of the specialisations, particularly for domestic violence and family law, are going to require a great deal of specialism.

As we have heard from a number of speakers, it is certainly the view that the Court of Session operates very effectively. We have heard assurances from Lord Gill about the sheriff courts, but clearly we have also heard concerns about that. It is not simply about the technology, not least because the personal injury court is likely to occupy the same building; it is about the procedures that are going to be adopted. We have heard that they are expected to result in cost savings.</p><p>Sanction for counsel is an issue that I place great store in. It was a key aspect of the evidence that we heard from the EIS, the Scottish Police Federation and the Scottish Trades Union Congress. The STUC talked about the imbalance inherent in the employee-employer relationship, nowhere more so than in health and safety. The STUC also acknowledged that that imbalance was in part addressed by health and safety laws, which as we know are reserved, and a court system that ensured that workers had access to the best representation and were certainly never going to be outgunned in terms of representation. What we heard from the cabinet secretary on equality of arms is therefore certainly welcome.</p><p>There has been some discussion about section 69 of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013. I see that as a further attack on workers&#8217; terms and conditions. We know that are no simple health and safety cases at this time.

We often have discussions about what should be in the bill and what should be in guidance, and I am keen that we do not have to rely on benevolent interpretation of guidance. I will therefore propose an amendment to have a statutory presumption in favour of sanction for counsel in relation to work-related incidents.</p><p>In the short time that is left to me, I commend the fact that our report talks about an environmental justice court. I encourage the Scottish Government to stick to its 2011 manifesto pledge on that issue. The issue was raised in answer to Patrick Harvie. It is important that we adhere to the Aarhus convention. The most important thing is that our civil justice system serves the people, but it is important that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water as regards the service that we have had from various people, not least the advocates.</p><p>The rural dimension has been considered.

In the sale of land by the Forestry Commission, land is often offered in small pieces to the local community. If the local community decides not to declare an interest in the land, buy it or attempt to buy it, it tends to be put together in one very large piece. A local trust, which could not contemplate buying the land as a whole but, together with local businesses, could buy smaller pieces and make something of the land, is thereby denied the chance to do so. That is worth looking at.</p><p>I agree with Claudia Beamish when she says that the issue does not apply only to the Highlands and Islands. We now see in urban areas the interest and energy that is released in a community when it has ownership. The land fund is perhaps inadequate at the moment, but I hope that it will grow to allow people to take ownership of land in urban areas.</p><p>There is often frustration. There are examples of tenant farmers who are desperate to buy the land they farm but who know that the absentee landowner wants to deny the sale and, in the long term, wants to close the farm. There are small businesses that are tenants of large estates and who work on a month-to-month lease. That is an unacceptable practice if we are to grow sustainable communities.</p><p>I want to cite some examples. In Mull, the forest crofts are proving to be a success. Liberating people to do the best they can with a piece of land has to be the first consideration. That clearly is the case in the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill, in terms of the public interest. That says everything about what we would like to see in land reform.</p><p>I congratulate David Cameron&#8212;not that David Cameron, but David Cameron the chair of Community Land Scotland; he is from Harris, not London&#8212;and Peter Peacock, lately of this Parliament, on the work that they have done in bringing about the Bunchrew land declaration.

There is an enormous future if we can only see the potential of urban and rural land, given the opportunities that have been lost over generations&#8212;and now hundreds of years&#8212;as Scotland continued to have a feudal land system into the 20th century, which is really shocking.</p><p>Let us acknowledge the Bunchrew land declaration and its worth.

As someone who always had dogs until very recently, it was sad and yet uplifting for me to learn about the number of dogs that are picked up by the trust&#8212;more than 4,500 in 2012&#8212;and are then all well cared for by the staff and volunteers until they can be rehomed or their owners can be traced. I was also very impressed by the dedicated work of the staff. It was their first-hand accounts of current issues of animal welfare that led to my support for compulsory microchipping.</p><p>Compulsory microchipping would go a long way towards helping to reduce the numbers and to improve animal welfare in Scotland. Currently, 40 per cent of reunions between dog and owner are due to microchipping and registration. With a compulsory scheme, more of those cases could be solved. Of course, not every dog that is picked up by local authorities or the Dogs Trust is genuinely lost, and some are found with clear signs of neglect or worse. Compulsory microchipping would help to bring to justice more individuals who are clearly unfit owners. Although, as OneKind noted, microchipping would not on its own protect dogs from neglect and ill treatment, it would help to trace the perpetrators.</p><p>I agree with the Dogs Trust and OneKind that proposals to introduce muzzling would be a retrograde step for animal welfare. It would treat the symptom rather than the cause, while at the same time punishing the vast majority of dogs and their owners for the actions of a few. It would suggest that every dog is dangerous and would breed distrust and fear, and there is no evidence that it would reduce dog violence in general.</p><p>There are obviously some individual dogs that require muzzling, but there is already a mechanism in place for that. Placing a general requirement on all dogs would be authoritarian and unnecessary, and would not have my support.</p><p>Another element of animal welfare that should be considered, and which has not been mentioned, is the suitability of certain breeds for certain lifestyles. On my visit to the Dogs Trust, I saw a large number of active dogs&#8212;huskies, malamutes and collies&#8212;that had been abandoned or brought to the centre by owners who had realised that they really did not have the time, space, energy or ability to give their pets the exercise that they needed. The Dogs Trust is careful to ensure that every dog that it rehomes is matched to an owner with the capacity, both physical and environmental, to satisfy the dog&#8217;s needs. That is another element that we perhaps need to think about.</p><p>My hope is that the debate can help to start a conversation in Scotland about responsible dog ownership in all its forms, and that the benefits of compulsory microchipping, as well as the case against muzzling, are recognised and taken on board.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Responsible Dog Ownership"}, {"date": "2014-04-23", "body": "<p></p><p>7.

The issue is being raised around the world by the United Nations, and yet the situation persists.</p><p>This might be slightly irrational of me, but when John Lamont suggested that the situation, in which people must live in appalling conditions, is the fault of the Government in Gaza, I wondered whether Palestinians would say that people in Scotland deserve the welfare situation that we have here because it is our Government&#8217;s fault. The issue has nothing to do with that. I feel in my heart that real injustice is being done to the Palestinian people. It might be the case that the political situation needs to be resolved, and I know that the problem in the middle east is complicated, but we are concerned with a situation that is causing people to die and families to be driven apart.</p><p>There are many visual images of the hardship that people are suffering. Books have been written and films have been made that show us the arid lands and the results of a deliberate withdrawal of resources, including water for arable lands&#8212;to feed the olive trees, for example. Water is needed to give life to the Palestinians. It is the source of life, and to deny the Palestinian people their right to clean water and sanitation is despicable.</p><p>We can contrast those images with images of the lush growth in the settlements, where there is plenty of water. Members cited the facts and figures. We heard about people having access to 70 litres as opposed to 340 litres, and we heard that in the west some of us have the luxury of access to 4,000 litres per day.</p><p>I hope that the thirsting for justice campaign has huge success and that we can reach the hearts and minds of people who care about the Palestinian people. There are Jewish organisations and Israeli people who feel that the situation should not be allowed to continue. Not everyone in Israel thinks that the situation is somehow justified or okay.</p><p>If the Scottish Parliament can do anything, I hope that we will try to unite with such people to effect change. Change for the Palestinian people might have to come as a result of Israelis talking to Israelis. However, let no one be uncertain about the feeling in this Parliament. The situation is untenable and cannot be allowed to continue.</p><p>I thank Claudia Beamish and John Finnie again for bringing this timely debate about a desperate situation that we must all try to alleviate.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Thirsting for Justice"}, {"date": "2014-02-19", "body": "<p>The stated policy intention behind the bill is to contribute to Scotland being the best place for children to grow up, and I applaud that intention. It is vital to the Scotland that we wish to create, which recognises not only the vital contribution that children and young people make to our society and our communities but that, in order for them to make that contribution, they deserve and require our respect, our protection and our nurturing.</p><p>I welcome the provisions in part 1 of the bill but, like many organisations and individuals working with and for children in Scotland, I am disappointed that part 1 does not go further. Accepting all the stage 3 amendments would go some way to progress our commitment to children&#8217;s rights, and accepting amendment 116 would form a key part of that commitment.</p><p>My amendment seeks to place a duty on Scottish ministers to establish a body within one year of royal assent to examine the case for giving legislative effect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I recognise that the Government has intimated that it believes full incorporation to be unnecessary; I also recognise that the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s stage 1 report raised questions over how that could be done meaningfully.</p><p>I hear what the committee has said about incorporating children&#8217;s rights, but why do we need evidence to accept that children have rights that should be upheld and promoted in law in the same way that adults do? The same arguments were not made when the case was made for the adoption of the European convention on human rights, or for extending the Human Rights Act 1998 to apply to devolved matters during the passage of the Scotland Act 1998. If we did not require evidence to apply human rights to our domestic law, why do we need evidence for children to have rights in law?</p><p>There has been strong support for such a move from the children&#8217;s sector and the human rights sector. Incorporation of the UNCRC was supported by UNICEF, the Scottish Human Rights Commission, Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, the NSPCC, Families Outside and Together. Amendment 116 has the support of Children 1st, Barnardo&#8217;s, Together, YouthLink Scotland, Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People and a number of academics across the legal and sociological disciplines. For such a move to be supported by such a wide range of interested organisations surely suggests that the amendment has merit.</p><p>The bill should mark not the end of our journey in the process, but the beginning. Today, we can commit to explore how to incorporate children&#8217;s rights into our legislative framework; signal our intent to make our society truly a child-centred one; and recognise children as having rights in their own regard, which all of us should be willing and devoted to pursuing.</p><p>Amendment 116 would give Scottish ministers considerable scope to determine how best to achieve that. Setting up a body such as an independent commission to examine the options would make a statement that I hope we can all support. The amendment would not require Scottish ministers or the Parliament to commit to anything other than the establishment of an appropriate body and consideration of its report. In doing that, we would send a clear signal about the importance that we attach to children&#8217;s rights and provide a clear message about the seriousness of our commitment to make Scotland the best place to grow up. Therefore, I hope that Scottish ministers and all MSPs, from all political parties and none, will support amendment 116.</p><p>I move amendment 116.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-02-19", "body": "<p>I return to the wording of amendment 116 and reiterate what it would do and what it would not. It would require Scottish ministers to set up a body to consider whether the UNCRC should be given legislative effect. It does not state what sort of body that should be, nor does it insist that the UNCRC should be given legislative effect. It would allow ministers and indeed MSPs to charge that body with exploring all the issues relating to this matter. The body would have to lay its report before Parliament and Scottish ministers would be expected to respond. At no point in that process would there be a burden, responsibility or even an expectation on Scottish ministers and MSPs to commit to giving legislative effect to the UNCRC.</p><p>As someone who believes passionately in creating a rights-based society for all, I hope that the option of giving legislative effect to the UNCRC would be explored fully and that the body would conclude that that would be the appropriate thing to do. I hope, too, that the body would provide advice on how and when to do so. However, committing to establishing the body would not commit future Governments or Parliaments to its recommendations. We would still be able to make that democratic decision, which is as it should be.</p><p>I have made my views clear on why I think it is important for Scotland to incorporate the UNCRC into our legislative framework, but far greater politicians than me have called on us all to do more for children.

His love for children and his appreciation of their needs, rights and interests, and of society&#8217;s duty and responsibility to protect and nurture them by being child centred and furthering their rights, provide us with more and indeed compelling reasons to do as I suggest.</p><p>I uphold my amendment 116.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-02-19", "body": "<p>I am upholding it&#8212;I am pressing it.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-02-05", "body": "<p>As always, I pay tribute not only to the hard work of the cabinet secretary in putting together the budget but to the efforts of the Finance Committee clerking team in helping those of us who are on the committee to scrutinise the budget and shed some light on the issues at hand. I am pleased to have the opportunity to go over some of those issues in this stage 3 debate.</p><p>The Scottish Government is to be congratulated on producing a positive and ambitious budget despite the tough economic environment and Westminster&#8217;s disastrous austerity agenda. Once again, vital components of Scotland&#8217;s social wage&#8212;free prescriptions, free personal care and public transport for the elderly, and free university education&#8212;have been protected. When household budgets are being squeezed by rising food prices and energy costs, those measures are not only welcome but necessary.</p><p>As a member of the Finance Committee, I am particularly pleased that the Scottish Government has strengthened its commitment to prevention, spending to stop social and health problems before they start instead of relying on expensive cures once it is too late. That philosophy is increasingly being followed in Government strategy, and the budget includes &#163;30 million over two years to support the voluntary sector&#8217;s vital work in that area.</p><p>However, far too many charities are still being given funding settlements for just one year at a time, which makes it hard for them to plan and invest in future services. For example, the Badenoch &amp; Strathspey Community Transport Company, which is extraordinarily good, faces an uncertain future despite providing an essential service that is well used by hundreds of people every week. We need to move to an expectation that funding for community projects will be for several years at a time, which will create the security that these brilliant voluntary sector services need and deserve.</p><p>On a more general note, I was pleased to see so many parties voting for the principles of the budget at stage 1. That is a testament to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s ability and his determination to get the best deal that he can for Scots from all walks of life. It also demonstrates that, despite differences of opinion on Scotland&#8217;s constitutional future, a solid majority in this Parliament believe that there is such a thing as society, that we cannot slash and burn our way to a better economy and that a healthy economy is based not on how those at the very top weather the storm but on how those at the bottom are protected from the harsh winds of an economic storm that continues to wreak havoc on communities up and down Scotland.</p><p>I am still angry that the bedroom tax was imposed on Scotland in the first place. I am angry that other welfare cuts, which are driven by ideology and lack compassion, are causing tens of thousands of Scots to turn to food banks. I am angry that a party that has been consistently and overwhelmingly rejected by the Scottish people for years continues to hold the purse strings. No matter what sterling work the cabinet secretary is able to do within the confines of our financial settlement and no matter how much we may agree with the second-largest party in this Parliament, the fact remains that, until Scotland has the full economic powers of any other nation, there is only so much that can be done to counteract the me-first attitude of Westminster&#8217;s right-wing orthodoxy.</p><p>At the end of her speech, Jackie Baillie declared with great aplomb&#8212;I hope that I am quoting her correctly&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;Today we can vote in effect to end the bedroom tax&#8221;.</p><p>Well, we cannot. We cannot simply vote to end the bedroom tax&#8212;that is the point of wanting Scotland to have independence.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 3) Bill: Stage 3"}, {"date": "2014-02-05", "body": "<p>No, I do not accept that at all. We have mitigated some of the worst outcomes of the bedroom tax, but we have not ended it. In fact, Scotland is going to pay dearly, to the tune of possibly &#163;50 million from other services, to mitigate the bedroom tax. Let nobody be under any illusion that we have ended the bedroom tax.</p><p>The Conservative members who have spoken so far have pointed out that the cabinet secretary has not mentioned business or the economy, and they have said that this is not a budget for business. However, it seems to me from all the reports&#8212;those in what I might choose to call the English papers as well as those in the Scottish papers&#8212;that the big issue today is not the business community. The biggest issue&#8212;the one that is hitting everyone&#8217;s mailbox&#8212;is the bedroom tax and its effects on housing associations and local authorities.</p><p>I highly recommend the budget. I can only repeat what many other members have said: the only way to mitigate the bedroom tax is to abolish it, and the only way to guarantee that it will be abolished is to vote yes on 18 September.

I believe whole-heartedly that this can only be a positive step for Scottish society and in particular for its LGBT community, who have for so long been denied the choice that so many of us have taken for granted: the choice to say &#8220;I do&#8221;.</p><p>I pay tribute to the work of Stonewall Scotland, the Equality Network and the Scottish Youth Parliament, which, among many organisations, have been strong, considered and rational voices calling for this necessary change.</p><p>As well as highlighting the positives, it is important to reiterate to those who do not support the bill that they really cannot have anything to fear from this move towards equality. I believe that the religious safeguards that are currently proposed, whereby religious institutions are permitted, if they so wish, to hold equal marriage ceremonies, suitably protect both institutions that do not wish to do so and those that do. There are institutions, such as certain parts of the Jewish faith and the Quakers, that wish to conduct equal marriage ceremonies, and to disallow that would in itself be faith-based discrimination.</p><p>Several countries across the world have already legalised same-sex marriage, including a number that are signatories to the European convention on human rights. Religious freedom has remained in place for those with traditional views on marriage, and I suggest that that will also be the case in Scotland.</p><p>Among its many provisions, the Equality Act 2010 makes it illegal to deny a person or an organisation access to public services&#8212;or to deny charities support&#8212;based purely on views on same-sex marriage. The act ensures that no duty is placed on any religious body or individual celebrant to conduct these ceremonies. The existing law already rightly states that all decisions on fostering or adoption should be based on the interests of the child, not on the views of the prospective parents.</p><p>Marriage does not belong to any one organisation. Many people in the LGBT community wish to be married in order to have equal status in society. Civil partnerships do not put same-sex couples on an equal footing. As human beings, they do not wish to be treated differently from anyone else. I believe that the bill will help to make Scotland a more equal society.</p><p>Many in the LGBT community want to be married in accordance with their religion, and many religions are in favour of same-sex marriage, including Unitarians, Quakers, humanist-liberal Judaists, the Metropolitan Community Church and the Open Episcopal Church. Like other members, I have received correspondence from some Church of Scotland ministers and from observant Protestants, Catholics and people from other denominations in which they express their support for same-sex marriage, so we must not believe that everyone in every church feels that the bill is wrong.</p><p>The evidence overall suggests that the bill has public support. Opinion polls have consistently shown that the level of support for same-sex marriage is around two thirds of those polled. The 2010 Scottish social attitudes survey found that, when asked the question &#8220;Do you agree or disagree that gay and lesbian couples should be allowed to marry?&#8221;, 61 per cent of respondents said that they agreed; only 19 per cent said that they disagreed. Perhaps Scotland really is moving on.</p><p>The Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party and the Green Party all had equal marriage proposals in their 2011 election manifestos, with varying degrees of commitment, and a Conservative-led Government has introduced same-sex marriage in England and Wales.</p><p>I can remember when homosexually itself was considered a criminal offence. Scotland has come a long way in a relatively short space of time. I hope that the passing of the bill will form one more link taking us towards a progressive, equal and tolerant Scotland.

I have found it difficult to do that over the last period because, regardless of our views on the matter, the whole focus seems to have been on the referendum.</p><p>I have never had any problem with my identity: I was brought up&#8212;and have always been proud to be&#8212;a Fifer. I was brought up by my mum, who, although she did not have any label, could be fairly described as a socialist. She brought me up to believe that we had to fight for better opportunities for working people, that working people had never got anything for nothing and that we always had to fight for what we got. It would be fair to say that my mum was not keen on the Tories&#8212;and neither have I been.</p><p>That is my starting point in looking at the best way of moving forward with regard to this debate. Joan McAlpine talked about our talent going south, but what angers me and, I think, many people is seeing the masses of young people in Scotland&#8212;Scotland&#8217;s precious resource&#8212;not getting the opportunities. If we are talking about ambition for Scotland, our ambition must be to give every child, no matter what household or area they were born into, the opportunity to achieve their full potential. Surely the key objective that we must fight towards is the eradication of poverty and deprivation right across Scotland. We must be tough on poverty, and tough on the causes of poverty. However, when I look about me, I have to say that I have seen more direction, more policy and more political leadership with regard to tackling poverty and inequality and giving young people opportunities in the past two and a half years of a Labour administration in Fife than I have seen in the past seven years of the Government led by Alex Salmond.</p><p>For a start, we need to invest in housing. Surely every child has the right to a roof over their head, but over the past seven years the money that has come into local authorities for housing has been cut. We also need to focus on early intervention and family intervention. One of the first things that the Labour administration in Fife did two and a half years ago was redirect &#163;8 million into family centres to focus on those in greatest need. We can either introduce populist policies that make us popular with everyone, or prioritise and direct resources at communities, schools and the areas that need them most&#8212;and that is what there has been a lack of.</p><p>When I think about the issue, I think about how we can best move forward and tackle the priorities. I conclude that the way to do that is to pool and share resources across the United Kingdom. We need a strong Scottish Parliament that uses the powers that we have. Another point that must be made is that I have yet to see the use of a range of powers that the Parliament has and which we could use to tackle inequality across Scotland.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, {"date": "2014-08-21", "body": "<p>Under the previous Labour Government, more than 1 million pensioners were lifted out of poverty across the UK, and many of them were in Scotland.

The Trussell Trust does not count sanctions, as such. Vouchers were also issued because of refused crisis loans. Those are major factors in driving people into absolute poverty. The basic right and need that everyone in this country has to be able to feed themselves is being denied them.</p><p>The Tories and the Liberals need to come out of denial. We have food banks and major problems in our communities. We need to examine why that is the case, to stop being in denial that the problem exists, and to start to look at how we can mitigate those issues. It is unacceptable for the whole of Scotland and, indeed, the whole UK that people have to rely on charity in order to feed themselves.</p><p>When I think about the welfare state, I also think about Clement Attlee and his Government of 1945, which brought about the creation of the welfare state. I think of the great Welshman and political hero Nye Bevan, who brought about the creation of the national health service, which is one of the greatest social creations of the 20th century and into this century. They recognised that, by pooling and sharing the resources of 60-odd million people across the United Kingdom, we could build a welfare state and a health service that would be the envy of the world.</p><p>That is why the answer to our current issues is not narrow nationalism that wants to create disharmony and to pit people against one another. It is about continuing to work to share resources across the United Kingdom so that people in any part of it will work together when people in any part of it are in difficulties.</p><p>We have to be tough on poverty and on the causes of poverty. On being tough on poverty, the Oxfam briefing that was sent out earlier highlights that</p><p>&#8220;Clydebank Independent Resource Centre supported clients to claim over &#163;3.5&#160;million in the 2013/14 financial year.&#8221;</p><p>Those moneys were not being claimed. My criticism of the Scottish Government is that it is not working with local authorities and organisations across Scotland so that we can be tough on poverty.</p><p>I saw Nicola Sturgeon on television the other night and thought that she was announcing a new &#163;0.5&#160;million for food banks. The following day, I discovered that it was the same &#163;0.5&#160;million that had been announced previously; she just said how the money was to be spent. I think that &#163;10,000 of that money is going to Fife. We need to work with the local authorities and at local level to ensure that we maximise how we are tough on poverty.</p><p>On policies, I say again that over the past seven years the SNP Government has a terrible record on trying to tackle inequality. I will pitch against that record the records of Labour Governments in the UK or in Scotland any time and in any place. In Scotland, 200,000 children were lifted out of poverty and pensioner poverty was halved. Those are achievements under a Labour Government. The SNP&#8217;s record on tackling inequality shows that it certainly has nothing to be proud of.</p><p>The SNP has even less to be proud of in being tough on the causes of poverty.

Does the minister not accept that our school estate across Scotland is in dire need of investment and that many schools out there need investment now? Will he not accept some responsibility and get into dialogue with local authorities to look at the maintenance needs of our school estate across Scotland?</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Fife Schools Maintenance Backlog"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>Is the minister willing to come to my constituency and look at a bagpipes project that has been set up in primary schools by the local area committee? If people are to continue to play bagpipes and if pipe bands are to continue to be part of Scotland&#8217;s heritage and communities, we need to take the issue into the primary schools. I would very much welcome it if the minister came and looked at the project.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Musical Instrument Tuition in Schools"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>I thank the minister for meeting Jim Eadie, Shelter and me, and for the positive response that we got.</p><p>I will certainly support the bill because, as Sarah Boyack and others have said, there are a number of positive measures in it, although it must be said that it would be a fairly dire situation if a housing bill that did not address some of the concerns that are out there was brought forward at this stage.</p><p>I think that it is fair to say that the bill will not be judged as something that grasped the issues of the time; nor will it be remembered for trying to tackle the many problems out there. It lacks that level of ambition. I say to Margaret Burgess that the next Labour Government that is elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2016 will cap rent increases, because that is the right thing to do. Hiding behind technicalities is not an excuse for not doing the right thing.</p><p>I remember the poverty trap in the 1980s and the 1990s and the number of people who were caught in it and therefore unable to progress, take employment and move forward. The excessive rents in the private sector now are creating that poverty trap again and holding many people back from getting into work and taking jobs that are not necessarily the best paid.</p><p>We can talk about the facts. Mary Fee mentioned the Audit Scotland report &#8220;Housing in Scotland.&#8221; The report says that one of the major challenges is a 29 per cent real-terms cut in the capital housing budget from 2008-09 to 2011-12. It also acknowledges that the number of new homes in the private sector has more than halved in recent years, despite the pressures of an ageing population.</p><p>The fact is that there are fewer affordable homes available for rent now than there were in 2008, 2010 or 2011. As Jim Hume said, we can have a bun fight over who built more houses, but to the people who come to my surgeries and the families who are homeless, it does not matter who built what. The fact is that we have a major housing crisis in every community the length and the breadth of the country but we are not making any radical proposals that would begin to tackle that. Therefore, I intend to work with Shelter over the next year or so to highlight why its policy to build 10,000 houses a year is the right one to begin to tackle the issues that are out there.</p><p>The private sector cannot solve the housing crisis; it is a flawed strategy that believes that the private rented market can tackle the housing crisis. I am not ideologically driven by public over private, but in this particular sector we need to build council and housing association housing now and at a much faster rate.</p><p>There are many families and people who are trapped in housing that is not suitable for them. Some families&#8217; houses are massively overcrowded. I would have thought that every MSP must have a massive housing caseload and be engaged with their local authorities.</p><p>I also make the point to the minister that a lot of the housing that is being built up and down the country is being built by councils. Those councils have been quite innovative in working with tenants to raise money to build houses, so when we are giving credit for the houses that are being built, that credit should go to the local authorities.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill"}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "body": "<p>I will conclude, Presiding Officer, by saying that, while I support the bill, we have a housing crisis that the bill does not begin to address. That is what we need to do.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill"}, {"date": "2014-06-19", "body": "<p>I, too, congratulate David Stewart on bringing the bill through its stages and getting it here today. I pay tribute to the minister, Derek Mackay, and the Scottish Government for their approach to the bill and for taking it on board. That is a sign of the way in which we can work together in the interests of our communities and of Scotland. I hope that, once we get past the landmark date in September, regardless of the outcome, parties across the chamber will start to work much more closely together for communities and for Scotland. I also pay tribute to the convener of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, Kevin Stewart, for the way in which the committee engaged with the minister and with David Stewart as the bill progressed.</p><p>With measures such as these, I always ask myself what they mean for my constituents. As Kevin Stewart said, all members could talk about buildings in their areas. When the bill first came to the committee, I talked about the former Crown hotel building on Cowdenbeath High Street, which is in a terrible state of dereliction.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s memorandum to the committee states:</p><p>&#8220;It is hoped that successful use of the new powers in the early years would give local authorities the confidence to be more proactive in dealing with defective buildings in the longer term. This may take some time and will need investment by the local authority from the start.&#8221;</p><p>The key point is that the bill will, we hope, allow local authorities to be more proactive. Cowdenbeath is the largest shopping area in my constituency and the former Crown hotel building sits at the end of the High Street blighting it. Despite continued pressure from local councillors and others, the council seems to think that it is powerless to act.</p><p>I met the council recently and asked whether it thought that it would be able to use the proposed new legislation to move things forward, and I wrote to the council last week. The council says that it will continue to put pressure on the building&#8217;s owners. I think that the bill will also put pressure on the council to act, so that the derelict building is pulled down.</p><p>At a time when the economy is starting to move and town centres are starting to see improvement, and at a time when local authorities are putting in more resources, it is important that the bill is used to force owners to take action and, if an owner fails to take action, to enable action to be taken on the owner&#8217;s behalf.</p><p>That is why I am pleased about the definition of &#8220;defective building&#8221;. The Scottish Parliament information centre briefing on the bill says:</p><p>&#8220;A defective building notice specifies particular defects in a building that must be rectified to bring it up to a reasonable state of repair for its age, type and location.&#8221;</p><p>An obsolete building on the edge of a major high street, which has no roof and has partly caved in, is a blight on the community and needs to be tackled, even if it is not a danger to the public.</p><p>I hope that the bill will help us in Cowdenbeath, and I hope that it will help communities throughout Scotland. I congratulate Mr Stewart on sticking in there and introducing his bill.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Buildings (Recovery of Expenses) (Scotland) Bill"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p>I think that it was Billy Connolly who said:</p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t vote; it just encourages them.&#8221;</p><p>At the Local Government and Regeneration Committee this morning, I mentioned to the Minister for Local Government and Planning how in Orkney and Shetland, for example, voting in local government elections is a bit higher than it is on the mainland. They do not have political parties.</p><p>For me, that is the starting point. All political parties and groups need to take some responsibility for how people feel. I accept that Tavish Scott was elected in Shetland, but generally in local government, the candidates are independents. Political parties need to take some responsibility for the way in which we campaign and organise, the way that we tend to avoid answering questions directly and the way in which we campaign against each other.</p><p>The council tax is a classic example of that. In my by-election, I was forever being accused of saying things that I had not said about the council tax. All that we do is turn the public off. A fundamental issue is the political parties themselves. The public have had enough of us and we really need to reform how we do our business.</p><p>In evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, Professor James Mitchell said:</p><p>&#8220;When we look at turnout and participation in elections for different levels of government across liberal democracies, we find that turnout is far higher in elections for levels of government that have more power.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 14 May 2014; c 3490.]</p><p>We need to look at that area. In local government, social work and education will take up something like 76 or 80 per cent of the budget. When we talk about devolving those services and the other statutory services around them to communities, we are talking about the margins of local government budgets.</p><p>We need to have an honest discussion about how local government is funded. At the Local Government and Regeneration Committee meeting this morning, I asked the Minister for Local Government and Planning whether he would accept that, once we get past the referendum, regardless of its outcome, we could perhaps get everyone in the chamber to start to come together and have a serious debate and discussion about what local government looks like and, more crucially, how it is funded.</p><p>There are major pressures. Without getting into a debate on local government finance and its funds, we know from demographics and the number of young people who are coming into care in local authorities that the demands on local government services are growing. Regardless of the political colour of the Government in the Scottish Parliament, or in any other place for that matter, we need to have a serious and grown-up discussion with local government and local communities about how local government is funded. I hope that we can start to have that discussion once we get past the referendum&#8212;I accept that it would be difficult to have it before then.</p><p>I agree that we need to look at all the other technical issues to do with improving voting, but there is something more fundamental at the heart of why people are not voting.</p><p>I support Sarah Boyack&#8217;s amendment. I am sure that many people in the Parliament who have campaigned will have seen for themselves, when they have gone out with an electoral register and started to knock on doors, that in many streets in areas in which there is higher deprivation household after household is not on the electoral register. It is right to flag up that point. I hope that the minister will take that on board and that we will have consensus at the end of the debate.</p><p>In conclusion, we should look at all the other things that have been talked about, but much more fundamentally, let us look at ourselves, political parties and how we finance local government.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections"}, {"date": "2014-06-11", "body": "<p>I congratulate Roderick Campbell on lodging the motion and securing the debate. I also congratulate James Mitchell and everyone who has put in their time and resources to restore the bunker and make it a major visitor attraction for not just Fife, but the whole of Scotland.</p><p>I look forward to visiting the attraction and to seeing what has been achieved there and what can be learned. I am very interested in the use of information and communications technology as a tool for getting history across and engaging young people in looking at the history that surrounds the bunker. I know that other visitor attractions in Fife want to try to update the tools that they use to get their message across.</p><p>As Roderick Campbell said, the Cuban missile crisis and other such events are very much in history, but we can learn much from them, and they can perhaps tell us much as we try to look forward to what kind of world there will be. I have always campaigned for and believed in multilateral disarmament, and we have made progress in that area. We need to continue to take forward multilateral disarmament policies, but the bunker&#8217;s history is important in looking at lessons for moving forward.</p><p>I welcome the investment in and the reopening of the bunker, which, as I have said, is a major tourist attraction for not just Fife but Scotland. Fife is good to visit and stay in. We have a whole load of facilities and resources. People sometimes associate tourism in Fife with St Andrews and the north-east of Fife. The bunker, which is in the east neuk, will be a welcome contribution to what is available in North East Fife, but as soon as people cross the bridge, they are into a major tourism capital and kingdom. There is so much in Fife. It now attracts more outdoor visitors than most parts of Scotland attract. Lochore meadows is based in my constituency. The country park there is a major visitor attraction, with more than 460,000 visits per year. The Fife Coast and Countryside Trust now maintains the Fife coastal path. A person can kick off from Kincardine, walk right up the path and visit the bunker on the way.</p><p>There is a key point that I have always made about all those tourist attractions. How do we ensure that we maximise the opportunities that exist? If we look at the economic strategy for Fife, we see that the tourism sector is really important, but we must consider how to maximise the opportunities, encourage developments and investment, such as in the bunker, and congratulate people on that. We must ensure that we have been able to pull together all the attractions and looked at how tourism can become truly a key part of the Fife economy that offers opportunities through training, skills development and jobs. We must encourage small and medium enterprises to set up to take advantage of the opportunities to attract more people into Fife.</p><p>It is important that we link up with our neighbours. I am a big fan of the city region agenda, and colleagues from the City of Edinburgh Council have told me that they are keen to see more opportunities in the summer for people to visit a much wider area than just the city of Edinburgh. The secret bunker will be a very welcome addition as a visitor attraction, but we need to ensure that we link up so that the councils in Fife, Edinburgh and neighbouring areas are working together to ensure that the wider city region and the beauty of Fife are part of the visitor attractions for people who come to Scotland.</p><p>Again, I congratulate Roderick Campbell on lodging the motion and securing the debate. I congratulate all those who have been involved in putting together the great visitor attraction of the secret bunker, and I welcome it on behalf of Fife.</p>", "theme": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Secret Bunker"}, {"date": "2014-06-04", "body": "<p>The committee&#8217;s report tells us two things. First, it tells us about the workings of the committee that produced it. Secondly, and more important, it tells us about the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals for an independent Scotland&#8217;s membership of the European Union.</p><p>I make clear that the committee was split between members who want an independent Scotland and members who think that Scotland&#8217;s best interests will be served by remaining part of a strong United Kingdom, within Europe.</p><p>On an independent Scotland&#8217;s position in the EU, the evidence is that nothing is certain.

It is clear that there would need to be amendments to all relevant treaties of the European Union, which would need to be unanimously agreed by all 28 member states.</p><p>What would be up for negotiation? The report highlighted important areas, such as the single currency opt-out. We might have to commit to joining the euro at our point of entry or later. Given that the Scottish Government is all over the place on the currency, and given that it would not be in an independent Scotland&#8217;s best interests to keep the pound and have no say over interest rates, money supply, the banks, employment targets or crisis measures, perhaps the euro is the nationalists&#8217; plan B for a future currency.</p><p>On opt-outs on Schengen and justice and security measures, and on the rebate, which would have major financial implications for the people of Scotland, there is a consensus that tough negotiations would be needed, although nationalist ministers still insist that there would be no compromise.</p><p>The view of nationalist ministers is not shared by the many experts who gave evidence to the committee, as the report shows.
